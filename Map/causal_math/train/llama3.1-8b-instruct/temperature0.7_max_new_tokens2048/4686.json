  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over complex numbers \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its transformation with a complex integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\tau z(\\\\tau)} d\\\\tau\\\\). We are interested in the behavior of this transformation over time and how interventions might alter this behavior.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) be uniquely determined at t = 0 after observing its transformed state through \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at t = T without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of the integral transformation, which accumulates and alters the effect of the original function over time, it's impossible to uniquely deduce the initial state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) just from the knowledge of its state at a later time. The transformation adds differentials at each instant which cannot be distinctly reversed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
