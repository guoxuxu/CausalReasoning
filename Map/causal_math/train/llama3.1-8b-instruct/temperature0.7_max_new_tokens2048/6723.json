  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{Bt} f(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( S[g](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{Ct} g(t) dt \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied at a midpoint z = M, does the final state of \\\\( S[T[w]](Z) \\\\) for Z > M depend solely on A?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation by \\\\( S[g](z) \\\\) further complicates the system by introducing another matrix exponential influence, C, impacting the final state alongside B and A. This additional layer modifies the dynamics and outcome at z = Z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
