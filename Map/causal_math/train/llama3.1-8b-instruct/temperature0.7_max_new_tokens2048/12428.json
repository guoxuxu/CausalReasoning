  "Problem": "Consider a physical system described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a linear operator. To analyze different scenarios, the Laplace Transform \\( L(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\) is applied, affecting the system's characteristics over time t.\n\nIf \\( L(x) \\) is applied to a function \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( L(x) \\) fundamentally changes the system's configuration by transforming the function into the frequency domain. This alters how \\( x(t) \\) evolves under the operator D, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
