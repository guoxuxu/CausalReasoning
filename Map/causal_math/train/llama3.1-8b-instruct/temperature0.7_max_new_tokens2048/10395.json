  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nIf at a certain step \\\\( n_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( S(x) = C x \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( x_N \\\\) for N > n_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x_N \\\\) after the intervention depends on A, B, and C. The system evolves to \\\\( A^{n_1} B x_0 \\\\), then the intervention transforms it to \\\\( C A^{n_1} B x_0 \\\\), and finally evolves to \\\\( A^{N-n_1} C A^{n_1} B x_0 \\\\), clearly showing dependencies on A, B, and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
