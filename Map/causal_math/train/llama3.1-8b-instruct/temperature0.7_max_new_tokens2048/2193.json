  "Problem": "Consider the laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a differentiable function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of introducing a derivative operation into the transform defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the derivative before the laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), yield a different result from applying the laplace transform first and then derivative on the transformed function, i.e., \\\\( F'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Using the derivative before the Laplace transform applies a specific formula: \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t)\\\\}(s) = sF(s) - f(0) \\\\), which differs from simply deriving the Laplace transform result, F(s), as \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) would deal with differentiation in the complex s-domain and not reflect initial conditions from the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
