  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), it's uncertain whether the state at \\( t = T \\) has been modified by \\( e^{Qt} \\) or not. Given \\( Qt \\) might not be trivially reversible especially if \\( Q \\) does not seamlessly invert with \\( P \\), retrieving \\( z_0 \\) accurately is not assured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
