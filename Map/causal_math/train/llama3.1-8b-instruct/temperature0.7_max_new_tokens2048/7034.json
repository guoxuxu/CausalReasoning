  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the equation \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit, and \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix. We are examining the role of the operator \\\\(T(z) = e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, in transforming the state of the system over time.\n\nIs it possible to exactly infer the initial state \\\\(z(0)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) by observing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\(z(0)\\\\), because the transformation \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) might have modified the initial conditions in ways that cannot be exactly reversed without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
