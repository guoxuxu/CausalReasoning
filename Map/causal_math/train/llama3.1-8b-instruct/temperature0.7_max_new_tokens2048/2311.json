  "Problem": "Assume a complex signal processing system that employs a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), to convert time domain signals, \\\\( s(t) \\\\), into frequency domain representations. We analyze the causal effects of applying an inverse Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(F) \\\\), and modifications to the signal post transform.\n\nIf a filtering function, \\\\( H(s) \\\\), is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the signal's transformation process after the Fourier transform but before the inverse Laplace transform, will the outcome at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) still perfectly represent the initial signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) modified only by \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) as an intervention after the Fourier transform and before the inverse Laplace transform complicates the final output. The filter modifies the frequency components, possibly introducing alterations like attenuation or phase shifts, which means that the outcome is a manipulated version of the initial signal, influenced by both the characteristics of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
