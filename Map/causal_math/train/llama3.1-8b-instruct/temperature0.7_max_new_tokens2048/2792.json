  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and its transformation by an integral operator \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{-it}z(t) dt \\\\). Analyze this transformation and its properties.\n\nCan we ascertain the exact nature of intervention (whether \\\\( M[z] \\\\) or any other functional operation) used on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) just by observing that \\\\( T[z] \\\\) evaluates to zero?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\( T \\\\) on the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) naturally results in zero due to the orthogonality in the exponential functions, and similarly for the zero function or other potential orthogonal functions, there's an inherent ambiguity. Various interventions or even no intervention could lead to the same outcome when \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, thus preventing a precise determination of the initial actions or manipulations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
