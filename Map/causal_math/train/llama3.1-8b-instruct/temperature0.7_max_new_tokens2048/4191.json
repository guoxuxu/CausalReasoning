  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta \\\\\\\\ \\beta & \\alpha \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) are constants, on the state vector representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation matrix \\\\( N = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma & -\\delta \\\\\\\\ \\delta & \\gamma \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t_1) \\\\) as an intervention, will the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend only on the original transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) means that the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depends on both transformations \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), as well as the ongoing influences of the exponential rotation function. This makes \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a product of multiple influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
