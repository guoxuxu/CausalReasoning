  "Problem": "Consider a fluid mechanic system where the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t \\\\vec{v} + (\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{v} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{v} \\\\). We introduce a scalar field temperature \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) affected by both convection and diffusion, described by the advection-diffusion equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t T + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nObserving the changes in temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the specific modifications in the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) at earlier times without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Temperature distribution alone cannot uniquely determine the underlying changes in velocity, as the same temperature changes could be caused by multiple, different velocity distributions due to the convolution of diffusive and advective effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
