  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, defined by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) was applied during the intervention at some \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), based purely on this information?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed state \\\\( T(u)(T) \\\\) under the heat equation could be influenced by various forms of the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), which differentially affect the evolution of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\). The lack of unique determination from the end result to the specific intervention reflects the non-injective nature of such transformations under differential and integral modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
