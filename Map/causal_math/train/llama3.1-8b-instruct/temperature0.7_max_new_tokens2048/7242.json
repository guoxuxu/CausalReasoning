  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\), specifically identifying the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used, without knowing the original function?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is observed and exhibits a delta function at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), it directly implies that the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was a complex exponential of the form \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega_0 t} \\\\). The properties of the Fourier transform allow for this precise deduction from effect back to cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
