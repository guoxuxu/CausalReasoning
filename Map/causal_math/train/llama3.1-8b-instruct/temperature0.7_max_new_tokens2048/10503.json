  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across an element is described by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( V \\\\) as a constant voltage amplitude and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the angular frequency. The response of the circuit (current, \\\\( I(t) \\\\)) is given by a convolution involving the circuit's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a filter \\\\( f(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is introduced at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting only further signal propagation, will the form of \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the original \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and not on the introduced \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the filter \\\\( f(t) \\\\) modifies the overall system's impulse response to \\\\( h'(t) = h(t) * e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\). This new impulse response, integrating the effect of the filter, influences the resulting current, making it dependent on both the characteristics of the original response and the filter's decay parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
