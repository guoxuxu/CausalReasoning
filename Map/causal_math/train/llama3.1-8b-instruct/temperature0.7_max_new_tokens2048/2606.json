  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, could we uniquely infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) means the initial state might have been transformed by M, thus affecting the dynamics. Since M can modify state vectors in a way that isn't necessarily reversible just by examining \\\\( x(T) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
