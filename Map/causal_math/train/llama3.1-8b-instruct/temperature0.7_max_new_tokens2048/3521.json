  "Problem": "A system is controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. This modification affects the trajectory such that the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) from this new initial state leads to a different outcome at time T compared to direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The presence of D and the way it interacts with M determines the deviation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
