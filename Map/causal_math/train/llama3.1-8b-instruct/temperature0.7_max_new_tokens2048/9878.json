  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constants. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system, where C is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately trace back to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clarity on whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have altered it in a complex exponential manner, non-invertibly masking the effects of the system's inherent dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
