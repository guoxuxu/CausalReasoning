  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nKnowing the final output in the Laplace domain \\( Z_f(s) \\), can we determine which modulations \\( m(t) \\) or \\( n(t) \\) (or both) were applied to the input \\( x(t) \\) and the interim output \\( z(t) \\), based solely on \\( Z_f(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( Z_f(s) \\), the convoluted effects of \\( M(s) \\) and \\( N(s) \\) on \\( X(s) \\) mean multiple combinations of \\( m(t) \\) and \\( n(t) \\) could result in the same final output \\( Z_f(s) \\). Thus, without additional information, it's impossible to uniquely determine the applied modulations from \\( Z_f(s) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
