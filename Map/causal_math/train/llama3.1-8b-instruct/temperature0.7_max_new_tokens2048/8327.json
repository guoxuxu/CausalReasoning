  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf an additional sinusoidal function of a different frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the combined function is then Fourier transformed, will the resulting \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\) depend only on the new frequency introduced, and not on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new frequency component modifies the overall spectrum, resulting in additional components in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) corresponding to both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_2 \\\\). The presence of multiple frequencies can also lead to interference patterns or additional spectral artifacts, thus the resulting spectrum depends on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
