  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(u) = u - e^{-\\mu t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final heat distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) depend only on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) = u - e^{-\\mu t} \\\\) adds another form of modification to the distribution, making the final state at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on both the earlier transformation parameter \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\mu \\\\), along with the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\). These transformations influence the distribution's evolution by adding and subtracting heat at different rates over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
