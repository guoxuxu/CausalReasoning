  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u}\\\\) to the function u and then analyzing its behavior under different scenarios.\n\nIf at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation, specifically the inverse Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the operator L and not on the Fourier or inverse Fourier transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Both the Fourier transform and its inverse are linear and reversible operations that solely reexpress the function in different spaces but do not alter the intrinsic dynamics imposed by L. The overall evolution is governed by L, and these transformations do not affect the evolution outcome beyond reexpressing its representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
