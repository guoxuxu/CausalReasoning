  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{1} e^{tz} dt \\\\) is applied, which modifies subsystem behaviors dynamically.\n\nIf at a certain time during the application of \\\\( I(Kx) \\\\), an intervention by applying another transformation \\\\( L(z) = Mz \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is introduced, will the resulting outcome depend only on K and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds another layer of complex transformation through M, impacting both the intermediate and the final states. The outcome after this intervention will reflect influences from both K and M, through combined and sequential impacts on the initial vector within the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
