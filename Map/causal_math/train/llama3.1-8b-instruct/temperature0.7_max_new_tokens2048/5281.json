  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to this function, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially and then the transformed function is allowed to evolve under standard complex function operations without further transformation, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) at t = T reflect the original function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is theoretically reversible under ideal conditions without loss of information. Assuming no additional operations that alter the transform beyond standard operations, the inverse Laplace Transform will accurately reflect \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
