  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. This system is influenced by transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a complex constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another dimension to the system’s evolution. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced not only by P but also by the effects of Q initially, and R during the intervention, impacting the system's composite trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
