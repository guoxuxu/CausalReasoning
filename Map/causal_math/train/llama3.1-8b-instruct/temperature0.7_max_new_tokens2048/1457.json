  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) in the complex plane defined by the equation \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\), where \\( A \\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{iBs}z(s) ds \\), where \\( B \\) is another real constant.\n\nIf the initial condition \\( z(0) \\) is set and the system evolves according to \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\) without the application of the integral transform, will the system's state at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if the integral transform had been applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the integral transformation, \\( z(t) \\) would evolve purely under the exponential growth due to \\( iA \\). The integral transform modifies the evolution by integrating over a transformed history of the state, altering the trajectory and endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
