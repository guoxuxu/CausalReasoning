  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), to the function u(t).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether scaling by \\\\( c \\\\), application of Fourier transform, or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various interventions, such as different scalars or timings of application, making it difficult to uniquely identify the specific intervention only based on the endpoint, especially without additional information about the form or time of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
