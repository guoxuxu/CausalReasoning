  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) defined in the complex plane and let \\\\(F(s)\\\\) denote the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is a real-valued function that corresponds to the real part of \\\\(f(z)\\\\). We examine behaviors when \\\\(z\\\\) traverses along different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf the path of \\\\(z\\\\) is linear from the origin along the real axis, will \\\\(F(s)\\\\) remain unchanged when compared to a scenario where \\\\(z\\\\) traverses a circular path around the origin, maintaining the same end points?",
  "Explanation": "The path in the complex plane can affect the function values due to potential discontinuities, singularities, or multivalued aspects of \\\\(f\\\\). A linear and a circular path might encompass different areas of analyticity and lead to different values of \\\\(f\\\\) along the paths, thus affecting \\\\(F(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
