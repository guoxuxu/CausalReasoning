  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is a control matrix. An integral transformation with kernel K(x, s) is applied to the state x, yielding a transformed state \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(x(s), s) ds\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the exact form of the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) from the knowledge of the transformed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The exact control input u(t) cannot be uniquely determined from z(T) alone due to the integral transformation which might obscure specific details about x(t) and its correspondence with u(t). This relationship loses information about exact instantaneous values of u(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
