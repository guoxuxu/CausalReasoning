  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) in the complex plane, transforming its domain using a Möbius transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants with \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\).\n\nGiven just the final result after some transformations such as \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) were applied in unknown sequence, can the specific sequence of transformations used be determined only from the final transformed value?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations, being Möbius and followed by a complex function like \\\\( f \\\\), can result in the same final value from multiple different paths due to the nature of complex function mappings and the non-unique inversion of Möbius transformations. Therefore, knowing only the final value doesn't allow us to deduce the precise sequence of transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
