  "Problem": "Consider a model for the propagation of a signal \\\\(s(t)\\\\) through a medium, where the signal is initially transformed by a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\), and the medium's response is modeled by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. The propagation is analyzed at various times t under different transformations.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial signal form \\\\( s(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information about whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied makes it impossible to retroactively determine \\\\( s(0) \\\\) with certainty, as the transformation could have modified the signal in a way that is indistinguishable at later times given the linear dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s(0) → u(T); u(T) → s(0)\" is incorrect, \"u(T) does not directly cause s(0) but the relationship is more complex. h(x) → s(t); h(x) → s(0); L → u; u → u(t); u(T) → L; L → s(0); s(0) → s(t)"
