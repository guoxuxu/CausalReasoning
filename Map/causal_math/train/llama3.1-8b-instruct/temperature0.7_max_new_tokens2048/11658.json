  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit system where the voltage across a capacitor (V) is related to the charge (Q) by the relation \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) where C is the capacitance. Additionally, a sinusoidal input voltage is transformed by a Laplace transformation, resulting in a transformed output that is affected by the system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original charge Q0 accurately from the voltage V(T) observed after the transformed sinusoidal input, without knowing details of the Laplace transformation or the response function H(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation of the input and the inside interaction via the response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) significantly modify the expected voltage output, complicating backward calculation to accurately deduce Q0. Additionally, phase shifts and amplitude alterations can occlude the original charge state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
