  "Problem": "Consider a system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves in time according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then letting this transformed state evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention consisting of an inversion transformation \\\\( I(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(t_1) \\\\), does the state at a later time \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend uniquely on L and not on the nature of the Fourier or inversion transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( I(x) \\\\) further complicates the system as inversion may alter various state attributes including symmetry, amplification, or attenuation of components. Consequently, the resultant state at time \\\\( T \\\\) will hinge on the interplay between L, the Fourier transform, and the inversion, not solely on L.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
