  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a complex constant, and its application in an integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We investigate how changes in the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) influence the transformation output.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at the end of the transformation, can one determine if an intervention changed the parameter \\\\( c \\\\) during the transformation process, based solely on the output data?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) could be influenced by various intermediate transformations or changes to \\\\( c \\\\), each leading to potentially similar outputs. Without additional information, it is not possible to distinguish whether changes to \\\\( c \\\\) or a consistent application of a single \\\\( c \\\\) value occurred throughout.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
