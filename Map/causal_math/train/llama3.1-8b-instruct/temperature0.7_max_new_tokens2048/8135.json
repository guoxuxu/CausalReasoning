  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) as a Laplace transformation applied on a time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). We further explore the effects of an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and t is time variable.\n\nIf an intervention using a second function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) (where B is a constant matrix) is applied partway through the recording of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed, does the outcome rely only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\) altering it further post-intervention, and since both A and B modify the function dynamically over different or overlapping time segments, the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on both transformations A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
