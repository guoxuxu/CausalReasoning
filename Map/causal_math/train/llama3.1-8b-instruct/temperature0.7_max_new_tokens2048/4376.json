  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane, described by the relation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Consider the effect spatially shifting this function using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + Ce^{Bt} \\\\), where B and C are constant complex numbers.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( q(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations, compounded by their complex exponential nature, make it impossible to resolve which were applied based solely on the endpoint. Different combinations of parameters and transformations could yield the same endpoint in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
