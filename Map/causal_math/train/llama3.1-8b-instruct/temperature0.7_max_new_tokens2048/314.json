  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately backtrack to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) could have altered it significantly, especially without knowing M.",
