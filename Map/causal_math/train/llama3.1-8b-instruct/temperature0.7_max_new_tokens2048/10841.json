  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by a complex function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed by another function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is some finite time.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is applied over the interval [0, T] and then transformed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation outcome \\\\( h(z) \\\\) be purely dependent on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) without influence of the parameter \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) because the integral transformation involves both the exponential factor of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and the decaying exponential term \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\). The interplay between these terms significantly affects the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
