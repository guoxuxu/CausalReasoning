  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. We analyze the behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nFrom observing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the transformations used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), simply based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state reached, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), might have been influenced by multiple sequences of transformations due to non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials in the transformations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This intricacy yields multiple potential origins and interventions leading to the same endpoint, obscuring the exact historical sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
