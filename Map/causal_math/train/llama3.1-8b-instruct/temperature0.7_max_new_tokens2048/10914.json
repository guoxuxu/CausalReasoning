  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nCan we determine \\( f(x_0) \\) after observing \\( z(x_1) \\) under \\( \\phi(z) \\) without knowing whether \\( \\phi \\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(x_1) \\) under \\( \\phi \\) without prior knowledge of the initial application means that the process \\( f(x) \\) that evolved \\( x_0 \\) to \\( x_1 \\) might have been altered in a way that makes recovering \\( x_0 \\) impossible. The application of \\( \\phi \\) complicates the mapping, introducing potential multiple solutions, and \\( f(x) \\)'s integral nature limits reversibility.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
