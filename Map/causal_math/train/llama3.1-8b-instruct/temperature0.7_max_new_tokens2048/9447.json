  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t that satisfy a coupled differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. We investigate how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), impacts causal inference.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the system is modified with an intervention via matrix operation \\\\( M \\\\) to the state function, will the Fourier transform \\\\( Z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original matrix coefficients A, B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\( M \\\\) changes the state directions or magnitudes, directly affecting both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and hence \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Consequently, the Fourier transform \\\\( Z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) will reflect the impact of M in addition to A, B, C, and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
