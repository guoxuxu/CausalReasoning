  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were used, based purely on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is inherently ambiguous; the effects of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) might overlap or mask each other due to properties of complex integrals and exponentials. The final state alone lacks sufficient information for distinct identification of the paths taken to reach it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
