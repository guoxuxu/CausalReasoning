  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of applying an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(h) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}h(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf a functional modulation \\\\( f(h) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} Cth(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)) is applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the transformation process, does the endpoint solely depend on \\\\( A \\\\) not considering \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the integral modulation \\\\( f(h) \\\\) over a subset of the original domain introduces a new parameter \\\\( C \\\\) which, together with \\\\( B \\\\), influences the resultant transformation. Thus the endpoint is not only influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) but also critically depends on \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), interacting through the integration of these combined dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
