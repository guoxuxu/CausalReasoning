  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its transformation by a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially defined and then transformed by the Fourier Transform without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a certain frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) be solely determined by the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is a linear operator that directly converts the time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into its frequency-domain representation \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is uniquely and directly determined by the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), without influence from external factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
