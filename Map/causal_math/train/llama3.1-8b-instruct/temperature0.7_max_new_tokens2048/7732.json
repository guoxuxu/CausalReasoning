  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a current source I(t) and an impedance Z(s) in the Laplace domain, described by the Laplace transform equation V(s) = I(s)Z(s). We investigate the behavior of voltage V(t) as an exact causal response to the current I(t) through various manipulations involving complex function transformations.\n\nKnowing the transformed voltage V(t) after the intervention \\\\( g(I) = e^{Ct}I(t) \\\\), and knowing Z(s), can we determine both the exact form of the intervention and recover the original I(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformation and recovering I(t) exclusively from the knowledge of V(t) and Z(s) is infeasible without additional information about C. Multiple potential transformations can yield V(t) that would satisfy the equation given different initial currents, causing ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
