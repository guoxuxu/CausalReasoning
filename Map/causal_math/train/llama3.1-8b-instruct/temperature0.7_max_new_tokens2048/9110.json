  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which ensures that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analytic. Further, suppose a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, producing \\\\( L[z(t)] = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = S, can it be conclusively determined if the initial complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was altered at t = 0 by a multiplication with some constant \\\\( c \\\\) without prior knowledge of \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific details about the complex constant \\\\( c \\\\), it is impossible to determine from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone whether and how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was altered. Various constants \\\\( c \\\\) can produce overlapping or indistinguishable effects in the frequency domain represented by the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Cauchy-Riemann equations → analyticity of z(t); Laplace transform → Z(s); Z(s) → s; s = S → constant S; multiplication by c at t = 0 → change in z(t)"
