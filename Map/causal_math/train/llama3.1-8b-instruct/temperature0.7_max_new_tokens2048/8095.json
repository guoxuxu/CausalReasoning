  "Problem": "Explore the relationships in a mathematical model where the periodic function \\\\( x(t) = cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by the integral transform \\\\( L\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf an additional linear operation \\\\( M \\\\) defined by \\\\( M\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = x'(t) \\\\) (the derivative of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)) is introduced at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final output of \\\\( L \\\\) after applying \\\\( M \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( s \\\\) unrelated to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M \\\\) modifies the function by taking its derivative, which emphasizes the frequency component in the sinusoidal function. This change impacts the resulting output of \\\\( L \\\\) and depends on both \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as the derivative intensifies the effect of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the transform process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
