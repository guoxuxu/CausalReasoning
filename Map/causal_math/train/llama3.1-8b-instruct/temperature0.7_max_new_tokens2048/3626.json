  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) tracing a path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, at different time intervals.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the rotational transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it's unclear whether the observed state at time T was due to natural dynamics or a modification by \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Without this information, multiple potential original states could correspond to the same observed state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
