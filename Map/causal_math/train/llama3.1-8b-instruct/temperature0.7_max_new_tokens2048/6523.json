  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf an intervention changes the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) to now compute \\\\( \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{az} \\\\, dz + \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{b e^z} \\\\, dz \\\\), does this outcome solely depend on the new parameter \\\\( b \\\\) and not on the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters part of the integral to depend heavily both on the value of \\\\( b \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\). Both factors significantly influence the result, altering it from what would be calculated without either the change in parameter or the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
