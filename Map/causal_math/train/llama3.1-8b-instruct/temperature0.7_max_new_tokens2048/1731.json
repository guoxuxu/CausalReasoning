  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study how an integral transformation by the operator \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}v dt \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, affects the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a new operator \\\\( S(w) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}w dt \\\\) (where N is a different constant matrix) is applied, will the ultimate function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The use of the intervention \\\\( S(w) \\\\) introduces an additional transforming effect, making the final function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on the matrix M and N, not just the operator L. This is due to the overlapping influences of the transformations and the specific characteristics of the matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
