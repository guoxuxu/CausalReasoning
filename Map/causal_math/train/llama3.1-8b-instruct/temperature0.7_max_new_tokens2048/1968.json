  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) refers to time. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the function and consider intervention through an inverse Laplace transform at different times.\n\nGiven the transformed Laplace outcome \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\) from an unknown transformation \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), can we specifically identify the transformation applied (i.e., the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) purely based on the final Laplace expression?",
  "Explanation": "The expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\) specifically defines the transformation as multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), allowing for the exact identification of the intervention \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) purely from the form of the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
