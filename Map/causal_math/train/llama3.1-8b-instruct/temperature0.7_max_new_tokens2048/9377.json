  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over time t in the complex plane, and its response under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = kz \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value of the function from \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) = k \\\\). As the function evolves, this initial scaling affects all subsequent values, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = ke^{iT} \\\\), which differs from \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\) unless k equals 1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
