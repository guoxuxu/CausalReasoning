  "Problem": "Investigate a discrete dynamical system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant square matrix representing the evolution operator, and \\\\( x_n \\\\) is the state vector at the n-th step. We also explore the influence on the system of applying a nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nIf at a certain step \\\\( k < n \\\\), an intervention represented by another function \\\\( j(x) = x - v \\\\) (where \\\\( v \\\\) is another constant vector) is applied, does the state vector at step n depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( u \\\\) or \\\\( v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at step k alters the course of the trajectory once again by applying \\\\( j(x) \\\\) and thus subtracting \\\\( v \\\\). Consequently, the resulting vector at step n is influenced by both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\), showing dependence on each transformation along with the effects of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) in shaping the system's progression.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
