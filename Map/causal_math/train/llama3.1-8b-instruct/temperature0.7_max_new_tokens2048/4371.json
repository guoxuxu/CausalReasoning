  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. Assume that the system's behavior is influenced by a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = L[z(t)] = L[u(t)] + iL[v(t)] \\\\), with s being the complex frequency.\n\nIf at a specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering operation defined by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where a is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s > 0 depend only on \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) and not on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) influences the dynamics by modifying the amplitude and decay characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and this alteration affects the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain. Thus, the output not only depends on the original transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) but also on the exponential decay introduced by \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
