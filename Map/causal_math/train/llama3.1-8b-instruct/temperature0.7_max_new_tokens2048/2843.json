  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(x, t) = xe^{At} \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We evaluate the results of incorporating an operational matrix, \\\\( P(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant scalar, impacting the function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( P(t) \\\\) is re-introduced as an intervention partway through the evolution at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), yielding the adjusted function \\\\( z(x, t_1) = xe^{At_1 + B(t-t_1)} \\\\) for \\\\( t_1 < t \\\\<= T \\\\), will \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\) equal \\\\( xe^{AT} \\\\) by time T?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( P(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the evolution path of the function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. The subsequent states are governed by the exponentiated effects of both A and B, specifically leading to a different endpoint at T compared to the unaltered path, depending on the scalar values of A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
