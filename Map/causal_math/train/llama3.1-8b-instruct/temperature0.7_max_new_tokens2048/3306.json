  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous dynamical system represented by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the system which transforms the original function \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\), followed by the application of an inverse transformation afterwards.\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine the original state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) perfectly without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied at any point?",
  "Explanation": "As long as the system's solution and transformation are deterministic and reversible, knowing the differential operator and its L-transform property, the original state can be uniquely recovered whether or not transformations were applied, provided there was no loss of information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
