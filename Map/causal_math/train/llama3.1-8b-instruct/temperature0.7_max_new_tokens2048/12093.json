  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which relates a function in the time domain to its counterpart in the complex, frequency domain. We examine scenarios where transformations such as filtering by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) are applied, and interventions by changing the function's form.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) just by observing its output in the time domain, without knowing the specific transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), or equivalently its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) because the inversion process depends crucially on the characteristics of the filter, which influence how frequencies in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) are altered to produce \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
