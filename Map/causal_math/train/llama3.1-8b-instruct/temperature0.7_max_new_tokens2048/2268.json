  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a constant real matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, influences z(t) over time.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = (k+m)*pi/A, can we determine precisely what interventions (either \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\), or both) were applied, by just observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex nature of the exponential transformations and the periodicity in complex exponentiation, multiple combinations of interventions (powers k and m) can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without additional information, interventions cannot be uniquely identified from the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
