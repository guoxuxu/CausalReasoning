  "Problem": "In a control theory context, consider the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) where C and D are constant matrices, and u is a control input. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform on the system's response, particularly through an impulse response represented by matrix H, where H is defined as the transformation \\\\(H(s) = C^{-1}D\\\\).\n\nGiven the output's Laplace transform Y'(s) after an intervention on D, and knowing H(s), is it possible to deduce whether D was altered, and to what D'?",
  "Explanation": "While a difference in the expected and observed Y'(s) indicates a change, precisely identifying the modification to D from the output's Laplace transform alone is generally untenable without additional data on system behavior or the nature of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
