  "Problem": "Consider a reaction-diffusion system expressed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u + k(u)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator and \\\\(k(u)\\\\) is a nonlinear function of u. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) over the spatial variable x.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely reconstruct which interventions (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), both, or none) were applied during the evolution of \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence and type of interventions based exclusively on the state at T, especially under the influence of diffusive and nonlinear dynamics, is generally non-deterministic. Multiple combinations of interventions and initial conditions could yield indistinguishable outcomes at time T due to the complexity introduced by the transformations and the nonlinear nature of the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
