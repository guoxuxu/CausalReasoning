  "Problem": "Consider the application of complex function mapping \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{z} \\\\) in the complex plane and its implications on the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\) defined for \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\\\). The Laplace transform is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( w = e^{z} \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( z = s \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the variable in the Laplace transform, does this directly affect the calculation or interpretation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w = e^{z} \\\\) maps the complex variable, but it does not directly alter the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) nor the integration process in the Laplace transform. The mapping changes the variable but not the integral operation itself or the function being transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
