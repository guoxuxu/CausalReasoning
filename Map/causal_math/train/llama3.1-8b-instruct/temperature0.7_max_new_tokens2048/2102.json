  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = xe^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. The transformation \\(\\ T : z \\mapsto z^2 \\) is applied to this function.\n\nBy observing the trajectory \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we infer whether \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) or no transformation was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Both the modified and unmodified functions can yield trajectories that intersect or overlap at certain times or conditions, making it impossible to conclusively determine the initial application of \\( T \\) from observations at a single point in time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
