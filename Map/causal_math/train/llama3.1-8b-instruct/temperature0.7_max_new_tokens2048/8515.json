  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\alpha z^2 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the implications of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = z e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new modifying factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\), making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interaction effects between \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), as well as the original dynamics defined by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The trajectory and hence the endpoint will be influenced by all these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
