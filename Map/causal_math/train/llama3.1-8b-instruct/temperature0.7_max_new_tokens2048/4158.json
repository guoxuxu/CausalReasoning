  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nKnowing \\(z(T)\\) after it has evolved from a Fourier transformed state \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}\\), can we unambiguously reconstruct the original state \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the Fourier transformation on \\(z_0\\), coupled with the dynamical evolution under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) leads to complexities that prevent a unique reconstruction of \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\). Changes induced by the Fourier transform can mask or alter information about the original state \\(z_0\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
