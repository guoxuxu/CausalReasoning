  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps complex numbers to other complex numbers, defined by \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) for a real matrix A. The evolution of the function is then impacted by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) known from integral transforms, specifically \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\), can we precisely determine whether matrix transformations A or B, or both, were applied to the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\) after integral transformation involves a mix of the effects caused by matrices A and B. Due to the overlapping influences and potential similarities in the transformations applied (especially in complex-valued functions and exponential forms), it is not possible to pinpoint precisely which transformations were applied based solely on the integral outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
