  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nWith knowledge of the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the types of transformations applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) possibly affecting the state in complex and interwoven ways, make it impractical to conclusively determine the interventions from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone due to the additive and integral effects involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
