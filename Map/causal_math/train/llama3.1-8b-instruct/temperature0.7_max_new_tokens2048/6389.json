  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) representing heat flow in a medium where L is a differential operator. We look at the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) during the evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to the state function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, then allowing the system to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T remain unaffected by the initial application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) transforms the state function into a convolution with a Gaussian function, which modifies the heat distribution initially, leading to an altered thermal diffusion process over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
