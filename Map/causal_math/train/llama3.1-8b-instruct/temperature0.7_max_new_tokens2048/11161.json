  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. To analyze causal inferences, we introduce an integral transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is calculated starting from a function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without further interference, can we ascertain that the transformed function \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) adheres strictly to the dynamics defined solely by P?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) incorporates the characteristics of Q into the evolving function, adding an extra layer of complexity that modifies how \\\\( z \\\\) progresses over time, hence the final state \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) is influenced not just by P but also by Q.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
