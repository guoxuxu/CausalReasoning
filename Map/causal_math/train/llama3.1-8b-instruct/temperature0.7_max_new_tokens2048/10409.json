  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is real and represents time, especially when transformed by another complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) under its original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( (e^{it})^2 = e^{2it} \\\\) at any time t, including at t = 0. Thus, at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\), the transformed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be \\\\( e^{2i\\\\pi} = 1 \\\\), rather than \\\\( e^{i\\\\pi} = -1 \\\\) which you would get without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This shows the effect of the transformation alters the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
