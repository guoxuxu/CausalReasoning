  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). We examine the changes caused by performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) over time variable t, such that \\\\( L\\{z(w)\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w^2(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), assuming \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nCan we ascertain whether a perturbing function \\\\( g(w) \\\\) was used or identify it from the endpoint \\\\( L\\{z(w+C)\\}(s) \\\\), only by knowing the transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform outcome is dependent on multiple variables, including the form and impact of the perturbing function \\\\( g(w) \\\\) and the original dynamics via A. Without additional specifics about how these variables interact or the precise initial conditions, it is not feasible to back-calculate to discern the intervention history or identify the intervention method precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
