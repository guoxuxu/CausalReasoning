  "Problem": "Considering a controlled experiment involving the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a system of differential equations with matrices M and N respectively: \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\). The experiment examines the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), where K is a constant scalar, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "As transformations involving matrix and scalar exponentials perturb the path and characteristics of \\\\( z \\\\) in non-reversible and potentially overlapping ways, it's not feasible to exactly parse out whether one, both, or a sequence of these interventions were applied only from the endpoint. There could be various combinations leading to the same outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
