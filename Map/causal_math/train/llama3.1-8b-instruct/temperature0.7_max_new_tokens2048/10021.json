  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 5 \\\\). We deploy an operator transformation \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^z t dt \\\\) over the domain of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to an input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then the result is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) without further intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( T(f(x)) \\\\) at \\\\( x = x_0 \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) on another function of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) not derived from \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( T \\\\) directly integrates the polynomial defined by \\\\( f(x) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( T(f(x)) \\\\) is specific to the polynomial characteristics set by \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) to a different function of \\\\( x \\\\) would result in a different integral value, reflecting the unique curve properties of the respective function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
