  "Problem": "Consider the operation of convolution on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) with a system impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) producing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\). We explore the causality implications of this convolution under a transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) where \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is another kernel function.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is there a reliable method to determine what specific modifications (if any) were made to \\\\( F(t) \\\\) during the convolution process just by observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution, being inherently a mixture operation, makes it challenging, if not impossible, to deduce specific modifications to \\\\( F(t) \\\\) solely from the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Multiple potential transformations to \\\\( F(t) \\\\) could yield the same or similar \\\\( y(t) \\\\), making unique identification impracticable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
