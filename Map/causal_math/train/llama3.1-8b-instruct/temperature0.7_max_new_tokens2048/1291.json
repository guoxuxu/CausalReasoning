  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. This function is used in transformations of signals in a system described by the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} h(t)z(t) dt \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being the system's impulse response.\n\nIf an additional filtering process \\\\( F(z) = p(t)z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is another function, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint output at time \\\\( T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) exclusively depend on the original system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filtering process \\\\( F(z) \\\\) modifies the input signal by introducing \\\\( p(t) \\\\), affecting the subsequent output. Therefore, the output at time \\\\( T \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( h(t) \\\\), but also significantly on the introduced function \\\\( p(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
