  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) denotes the temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) applied along the rod.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we definitively say what interventions occurred (whether initial conditions, intermediate cooling, or both) just based on the value of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions could produce a similar temperature profile at \\\\( T \\\\), especially in the presence of diffusion and external cooling effects. The overlap in potential contributions from initial and intermediate actions makes precise determination challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
