  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. To analyze the behavior, we intervene by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\cdot z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant, at a certain time.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a certain time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of whether or not the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely backtrack to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the potential phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) introduces ambiguity in determining the original phase of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
