  "Problem": "Evaluate the relationship between a Fourier transform given by the equation \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) and its impact on the system's behavior described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + a\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + bu = f(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nGiven observations of the system's response \\\\( u(t) \\\\) over time, can one unequivocally determine whether the original signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) underwent a Fourier transformation without additional knowledge of initial or boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing initial or boundary conditions, and considering that multiple different functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) could theoretically produce similar responses in \\\\( u(t) \\\\), one cannot unambiguously infer the precise transformations applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) such as its Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
