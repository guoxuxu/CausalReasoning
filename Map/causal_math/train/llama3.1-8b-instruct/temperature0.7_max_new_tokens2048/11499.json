  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nIf an additional filtering operation \\( g(t) \\) is implemented as an intervention at time \\( \\tau \\), does the final representation \\( Y(\\omega) \\) still only depend on \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\), not on \\( g(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another filter \\( g(t) \\) at \\( \\tau \\) modifies the system's characteristics. The output then becomes the convolution of \\( x(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\), and \\( g(t) \\), affecting the spectral content \\( Y(\\omega) \\). The final Fourier transform \\( Y(\\omega) \\) will incorporate effects from \\( G(\\omega) \\), the transform of \\( g(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
