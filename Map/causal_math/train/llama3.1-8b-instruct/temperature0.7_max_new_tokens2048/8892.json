  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod is guided by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. The rod's initial temperature profile is altered by a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) represents a specific heat profile added along the rod.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( f(u) \\\\), or both), solely based on the state at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can potentially result from various configurations of the initial profile and interventions due to the additive effects of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) on the evolution under the heat equation. Identifying the precise sequence or types of interventions based only on the outcome is not feasible due to the multiple possible trajectories leading to the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
