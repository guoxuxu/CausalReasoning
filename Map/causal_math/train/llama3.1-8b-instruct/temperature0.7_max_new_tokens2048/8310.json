  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( w(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and subsequently transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of this system under various transformations and interventions.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, determining the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is problematic as the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) significantly alters the trajectory. Any observed result could originate from various possible initial states due to the non-linear transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
