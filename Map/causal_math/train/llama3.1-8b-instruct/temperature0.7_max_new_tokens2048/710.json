  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. Analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform on this function, assuming the transform is defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = Z(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) requires knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the frequency of the original periodic signal, as this information dictates the poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the exact time-domain behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be accurately inferred.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).
