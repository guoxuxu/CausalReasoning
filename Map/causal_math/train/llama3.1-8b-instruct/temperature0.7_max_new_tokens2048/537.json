  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the relation \\\\( z(t) = L\\{y(t)\\} \\\\), using a Laplace transform L to convert the time-domain function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to the frequency domain. Assume \\\\( y(t) \\\\) itself satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{y} = Cy + D \\) where C and D are constant matrices.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{Dt} \\\\) is applied to the time-domain signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = 0, will the resulting output signal \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T match the output had \\\\( y(t) \\\\) not been manipulated by \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(t) = te^{Dt} \\\\) modifies the initial state and behavior of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), affecting its time-domain characteristics. This change in the signal will be captured by the Laplace transform, leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the frequency domain as opposed to if \\\\( y(t) \\\\) were unaltered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The function h(t) at t = 0 influences the time-domain signal y(t), which in turn affects the output signal z(t) via the Laplace transform L."
