  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) encompasses dynamics given by the matrix A. We explore the influence of modifying the function through multiplication by a matrix exponential \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( C \\\\) at some \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function form from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at s = 0 depend only on A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a different modification factor, making the final Laplace transform result dependent on A, B, and C. The dynamical shift from B to C influences the entire transformation subsequently, affecting the result at s = 0 due to different eigenvalues introduced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
