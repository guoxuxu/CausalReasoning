  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing application where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( X(f) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). The transformed signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by a frequency response \\\\( H(f) \\\\). We are particularly interested in the impact of modifying the signal processing steps with the inclusion of an inverse Fourier transform defined by \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\).\n\nIf a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is processed to get \\\\( X(f) \\\\) and then modified by \\\\( H(f) \\\\) to yield \\\\( X'(f) \\\\), and finally transformed back to time domain with \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), will \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) corresponding to \\\\( H(f) \\\\) in the time domain to \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Fourier transforms. Thus, processing through \\\\( H(f) \\\\) in the frequency domain and an inverse transform is equivalent to convolving \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) directly in the time domain.",
