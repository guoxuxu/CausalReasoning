  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over complex numbers \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its transformation with a complex integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\tau z(\\\\tau)} d\\\\tau\\\\). We are interested in the behavior of this transformation over time and how interventions might alter this behavior.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at t = 0 and allowing it to evolve naturally without further transformation change the outcomes at time t = T compared to directly applying \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) without \\\\(f\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) alters the course of evolution distinctly from the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\). The integral transformation accumulates the effect of the exponential function within its limit, fundamentally transforming the resultant function at any time T, thereby resulting in a different output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
