  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is subject to a transformation using a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = Ay(t) + Bx(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, and the transformation \\\\( h(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is a filter applied to the output signal, with C and D also being constant matrices.\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( k(t) = Ee^{Ft}y(t) \\\\) (where E and F are constant matrices) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying the system dynamics at that point, will the resultant output at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original system parameters A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The additional filtering introduced by \\\\( k(t) \\\\) significantly alters the system dynamics post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), incorporating the effects of E and F along with the original dynamics of A and B. The resultant output at \\\\( T \\\\) becomes a mixture of influences from A, B, E, and F, therefore not depending solely on A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
