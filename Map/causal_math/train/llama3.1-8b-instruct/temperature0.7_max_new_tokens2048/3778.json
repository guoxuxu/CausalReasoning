  "Problem": "Consider the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its corresponding Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine both components \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without additional context about the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) combines the effects of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) into a single function. Without additional constraints or information about the original functions or their relationships, it is impossible to uniquely and separately determine the individual forms of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). They could have multiple plausible pairs resulting in the same transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
