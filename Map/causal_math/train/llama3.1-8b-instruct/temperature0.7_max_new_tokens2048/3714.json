  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dv}{dt} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we lack critical information due to the potential alteration by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Since \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( A \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\) can interact in complex ways, determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without this knowledge is unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
