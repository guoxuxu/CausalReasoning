  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T: f(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The causal relationship of this transformation in signal processing contexts (Laplace Transform) is studied.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and analyzing it in the frequency domain give the same result as if no transformation was initially applied and the function was directly analyzed in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation changes the domain of analysis from time to frequency. The Laplace Transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) results in a function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the s-domain, which fundamentally differs in representation and properties from the time-domain expression \\\\( e^{at} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
