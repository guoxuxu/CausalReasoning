  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a function space, defined as \\( L[f](x) = \\int_0^x k(x, t) f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a kernel function. We analyze the impact of a multiplying factor \\( g(x) \\) on the function \\( f(x) \\) before applying the operator.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a certain point \\( x_1 \\) whereby \\( f(x) \\) is suddenly multiplied by another function \\( m(x) \\), will the final output \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\) (where \\( T > x_1 \\)) depend only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( g(x) \\) or \\( m(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( m(x) \\) changes the function from \\( g(x)f(x) \\) to \\( g(x)m(x)f(x) \\) in the region \\( x_1 \\) to \\( T \\), altering how the kernel \\( k \\) interacts with the function. This makes the endpoint \\( L[h](x) \\) dependent on \\( g(x) \\), \\( m(x) \\), and \\( k(x, t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
