  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) by the operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tA} f(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The transformation is used to analyze the effect of the modified function over the interval [0, x].\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on the function \\\\( f \\\\) preserve the initial function values at t = 0, i.e., is \\\\( T[f](0) \\\\) equal to \\\\( f(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[f](0) \\\\) evaluates to zero, as it is the integral from 0 to 0, which always yields zero independent of the function \\\\( f \\\\) or matrix A. Thus, it does not preserve the initial function value unless \\\\( f(0) \\\\) is itself 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
