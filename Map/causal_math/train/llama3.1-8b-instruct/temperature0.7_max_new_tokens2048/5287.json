  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( f^2(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be the same regardless of the choice of \\\\( t \\\\) in the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by rotating the point on the complex plane, which will affect the subsequent calculation and final position under \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Different values of \\\\( t \\\\) result in different starting points for the second application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), leading to different endpoints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
