  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled by a differential equation involving complex functions and integral transformations, specifically \\\\(I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)A}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where I is the current, V is the voltage, A is a constant matrix, and t is time.\n\nIf the voltage function \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is altered at t = 0 by a function \\\\(f(V) = V^2\\\\) without further intervention, will the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at time T be the same as if the original voltage function \\\\(V(t)\\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(V) = V^2\\\\) modifies the voltage input at the point of application, directly affecting the integral calculation of current. This nonlinear transformation alters the resulting current from what would have been produced with the unchanged voltage function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
