  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its effect on solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and other similar transformations, impact the behavior of solutions over the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and that transformed value is then allowed to evolve under the differential equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at a point \\\\( z \\\\) be the same as if the equation was solved starting directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by altering the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This effects how the solution evolves according to \\\\( w(z) = Ce^{kz} \\\\) since the initial value \\\\( w(z_0) \\\\) alters the constant \\\\( C \\\\). The trajectory of the solution in the complex plane will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
