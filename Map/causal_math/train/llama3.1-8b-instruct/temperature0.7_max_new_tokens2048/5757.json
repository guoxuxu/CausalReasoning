  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, does the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) impact the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial values of z, specifically, scaling both real and imaginary components by a factor dependent on t. This transformation adjusts the trajectory of both x and y components under their respective differential equations, thus impacting the state at any future time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
