  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve over time governed by a system of coupled linear differential equations. The system is represented by \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the influence of the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\) on causal inference between \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\nConsidering the final state \\(z(T)\\), can we determine precisely which transformations or interventions (like \\(\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\) or \\(h(z)\\)) were applied based solely on the end state observed?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\(z(T)\\) could be achieved through various combinations of interventions and transformations. Due to the complexity and potentially overlapping effects of these operations within the linear dynamical system, identifying specific interventions from the final state alone is ambiguous and uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
