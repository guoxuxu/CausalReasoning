  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We study the impact of a transformation performed by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), influencing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) can significantly alter the dynamics of the system, resulting in a different state at time T, depending on the relative properties of M and N.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
