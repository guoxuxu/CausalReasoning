  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nCan one uniquely determine whether an exponential term \\( e^{at} \\) was present in the original function \\( f(t) \\) after seeing the modified function \\( f(t) + e^{at} \\) for \\( t > 0 \\), if the process of modification is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the process of modification, it is impossible to ascertain whether the term \\( e^{at} \\) was present in the original function \\( f(t) \\) or was introduced due to the modification in its Laplace Transform. Multiple reasons (e.g., original presence or alteration) could lead to the observed end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modification of F(s) → Change in f(t); Change in f(t) → Presence of e^{at} term; Modification of F(s) → Presence of e^{at} term"
