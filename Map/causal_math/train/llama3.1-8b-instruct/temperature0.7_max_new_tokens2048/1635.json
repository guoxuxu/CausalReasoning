  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We're curious about the nature of the function under the Laplace transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). Consider s as a complex parameter and investigate specific properties under direct transformations and interventions.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = f(z + a) \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number) before applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), will the Laplace transform still only depend on the properties of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the intervention performed?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention shifts the argument of \\\\( f \\\\), effectively altering the function to be transformed. This modification fundamentally changes the nature of the integral in the Laplace transform, introducing dependency not only on \\\\( f \\\\) but also significantly on the nature of the intervention (the value of \\\\( a \\\\)).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
