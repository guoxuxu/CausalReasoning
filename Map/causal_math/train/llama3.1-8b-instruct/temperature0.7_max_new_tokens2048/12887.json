  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we precisely determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both were applied during the evolution from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), using only the knowledge of the output state?",
  "Explanation": "Depending on the nature of the transformations and their time of application, different sequences of interventions could lead to the same final state due to the complex interactions and the properties of exponential and polynomial transformations applied on the complex plane. This ambiguity prevents the precise identification of which transformations were used and when.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
