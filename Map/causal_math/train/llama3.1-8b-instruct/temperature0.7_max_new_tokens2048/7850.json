  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) in the complex plane where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), described by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dz} = Pu(z) \\\\), with P being a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qz}u(z) \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without definite knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to determine if the observed \\\\( u(Z) \\\\) evolved naturally from \\\\( u_0 \\\\) or if it was modified by \\\\( e^{Qz} \\\\). This transformation might have altered the initial conditions, making it challenging to trace back accurately due to potential changes induced by \\\\( Q \\\\) relative to \\\\( P \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
