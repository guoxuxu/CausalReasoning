  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation given by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\\\) where \\\\(W_t\\\\) is a standard Brownian motion, \\\\(\\mu\\\\) is the drift coefficient, and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is the volatility coefficient. We explore the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( Z_t = e^{\\lambda t}X_t \\\\) for some constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( Z_t \\\\) is formed by applying the transformation to \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\\\) without further transformation, will the process \\\\( Z_t \\\\) at any time t simply follow the dynamics of \\\\( X_t \\\\) scaled by \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation directly scales \\\\( X_t \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), and the evolution of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the given SDE is independent of this scaling during its trajectory. Thus, \\\\( Z_t \\\\) will always represent the process \\\\( X_t \\\\) scaled by \\\\( e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), following the prescribed dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
