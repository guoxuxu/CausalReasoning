  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output as a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we conclude that the original time domain signal was exclusively \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The distinct correspondence between a delta function in the frequency domain and a pure exponential in the time domain allows us to conclude that the original signal was indeed \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). The spectral properties of the Fourier transform are exclusive to this type of function under linear, time-invariant conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → delta function; delta function → frequency ω; ω → signal e^(iωt); e^(iωt) → Fourier transform; constant frequency ω → e^(iωt); time t → e^(iωt)"
