  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine changes when applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, modifying the amplitude and phase.\n\nCan we deduce the exact transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) used and their order by observing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations and their ordering can result in the same final state due to the properties of complex multiplication. Without additional information about the sequence or specific constants, it is impossible to uniquely determine the transformations and their application order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
