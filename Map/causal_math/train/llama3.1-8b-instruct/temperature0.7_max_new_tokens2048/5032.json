  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}t^z \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. The integral is an example of a complex function involving a Mellin transform.\n\nCan the original parameter s be determined after applying an intervention that shifts s by a known constant c by only analyzing the modified integral?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the intervention, the determination of the original s can be complex. The resulting behavior of the integral post-intervention depends on both the original s and c, making it difficult to isolate s without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
