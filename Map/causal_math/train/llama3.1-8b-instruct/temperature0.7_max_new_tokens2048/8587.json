  "Problem": "Analyzing a system under the influence of a complex function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), we examine the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The resultant transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) provides insights into the system's behavior in s-domain.\n\nIf an additional operation, the Fourier transform \\\\( F_t \\\\), is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) post Laplace transform, will the effect only depend on the original function and not on the sequence of transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the Fourier transform as an intervention after the Laplace transform can alter the resulting functional form in the frequency domain. This new transformation sequence impacts the ultimate outcome, making it dependent not solely on the original function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\), but also on how \\\\( F_t \\\\) interacts with \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
