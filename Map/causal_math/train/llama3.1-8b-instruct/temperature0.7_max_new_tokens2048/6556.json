  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z(t) + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nGiven the final observed state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after unknown interventions either modifying \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or adding/removing the constant \\\\( k \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied based solely on the knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can potentially be achieved through various combinations of alterations in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and/or adjustments in \\\\( k \\\\). The non-uniqueness of differential paths leading to a similar endpoint under different complex dynamics precludes precise identification of the specific interventions taken.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
