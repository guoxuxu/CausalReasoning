  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a function of time. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on the Laplace transform.\n\nCan we definitely determine the nature of the intervention (multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), a differential operation, or both) solely by observing the final Laplace Transform \\\\( sF(s-\\\\alpha) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace Transform \\\\( sF(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\) could result from multiple combinations of operations, not just the sequential operations supposed. Without explicit information on initial conditions and the sequence of interventions, multiple scenarios could produce the same transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "multiplication by e^(\\alpha t) → change in function f(t); function f(t) → Laplace transform F(s); multiplication by e^(\\alpha t) → change in Laplace transform F(s); change in Laplace transform F(s) → intervention nature"
