  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to their respective differential equations, \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied for causal analysis.\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\( F(z) \\\\) post intervention, can we determine the specific nature of the intervention (such as scale factor k and intervention time \\\\( t_k \\\\)) solely from \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\), even though affected by the intervention, integrates over time and combines effects in a manner that obscures discrete intervention details like the scale factor k and exact timing \\\\( t_k \\\\). Different interventions might result in the same or indistinguishable transformed outcomes, leaving these specifics undetermined from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
