  "Problem": "Investigate a system subjected to the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse, influencing a time-dependent function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially impacted by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) and analyzed for causality and effects of transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then it evolves under its intrinsic properties without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = a be equivalent to the transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at the same s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) changes the original function, resulting in a different Laplace transform due to the added \\\\( t^2 \\\\) term, which modifies the s-domain representation by shifting poles and potentially altering convergence properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
