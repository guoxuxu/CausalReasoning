  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) and their parameters, only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential transformations due to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could lead to overlapping effects, making it impossible to discern precisely from the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone which transformations were applied and their respective parameters. The effects of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) could result in multiple combinations leading to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
