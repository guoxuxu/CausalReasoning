  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is analyzed over the time domain.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = z(0) \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will the resultant function at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) match the one from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the initial conditions through convolution with \\\\( e^{C(t-\\\\tau)} \\\\), which affects both the growth dynamics influenced by matrices A, B and the new matrix C. The resultant function at time T will differ due to the integral operation modifying the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
