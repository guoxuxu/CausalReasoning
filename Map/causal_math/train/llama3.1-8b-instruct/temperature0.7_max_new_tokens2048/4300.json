  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the system's behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\), where M is another constant matrix and S is a matrix that diagonalizes D, i.e., \\\\( SDS^{-1} = \\\\Lambda \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\Lambda \\\\) being a diagonal matrix.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (i.e., \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, only by using the data of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping nature and potential commutative properties of the matrices involved in transformations \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\), multiple combinations of these transformations could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Thus, identification of specific interventions used without additional information is not feasible, reflecting the complexity introduced by the non-commutative properties of matrix exponentials.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
