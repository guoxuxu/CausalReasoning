  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a linear integral transformation defined by \\\\(I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA} f(s) ds\\\\) where A is a constant matrix and f is a vector-valued function. We assess the effect of a function perturbation on the transformed system where \\\\(f(s)\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(g(s) = e^{Bs} f(s)\\\\), with B being another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention via an additional function \\\\(h(s) = e^{Cs} f(s)\\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied halfway through the period (at time \\\\(t_1\\\\)), will the final output \\\\(I[f](T)\\\\) for T > t_1 reflect the effects of both A and C distinctly?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(s) = e^{Cs} f(s)\\\\) introduces a new factor affecting the input function from \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards, which will distinctly affect the overall transformation result. The exponentials play a significant role in modifying how the matrix A interacts with \\\\(f(s)\\\\) modified by C, yielding a transformed output dependent on this dual influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
