  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform output \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) after an unknown filtering, can we determine whether the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was part of the signal?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specifics of the interventional filter, it's not feasible to accurately conclude the presence or absence of the specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original signal. The spectrum could have been altered to either retain or remove any frequency, making it impossible to deduce the unaltered signal characteristics reliably.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
