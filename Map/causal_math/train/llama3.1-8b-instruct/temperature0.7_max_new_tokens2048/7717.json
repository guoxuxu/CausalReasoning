  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) evolves over time t, and study the effect of the Laplace transform, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this complex function.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace transform at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve over s without further changes, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) be impacted by the progression of t beyond t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform captures the entire evolution of the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) from t = 0 to \\\\( \\\\infty \\\\). Thus, every modification in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to t will influence \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), mapping the entire behavior of t into the complex s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
