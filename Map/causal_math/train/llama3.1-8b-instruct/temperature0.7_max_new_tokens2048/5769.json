  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. The system is analyzed using a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another scalar constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under differential equations for x and y without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under their respective equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) is a scalar exponential multiplication, it changes the initial amplitude and phase of the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a different trajectory and consequently a different state at time T than if the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been evolved directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
