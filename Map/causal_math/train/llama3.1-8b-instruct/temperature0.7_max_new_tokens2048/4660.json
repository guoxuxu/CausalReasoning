  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) undergoes transformations described by multiplication with matrices. We analyze the sequence where \\\\(x_0\\\\) is first multiplied by matrix \\\\(P\\\\) and then matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) over period t, expressed as \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\). A new transformation matrix \\\\(R\\\\) can be used as an intervention.\n\nGiven the final vector \\\\(x(T) = RQP x_0\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether stepwise \\\\(P\\\\), then \\\\(Q\\\\), then \\\\(R\\\\), or as a combined application in a different order), only by knowing the value of \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the order or presence of individual transformations, different sequences of applying \\\\(P\\\\), \\\\(Q\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\) could yield the same final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\), especially if the matrices are not commutative. This ambiguity prevents the unambiguous determination of the transformation process and order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
