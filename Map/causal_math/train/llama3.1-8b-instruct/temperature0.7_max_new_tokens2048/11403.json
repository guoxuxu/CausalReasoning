  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) models the energy states in a two-dimensional space depending on positions x and y. We explore the effect of a rotational transformation defined by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) applied to a vector \\\\( v = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S \\\\), defined by scaling \\\\( S = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & 2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( v \\\\) after the initial rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\), will the final energy state \\\\( z \\\\) be independent of the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even after adding a scaling transformation, the final energy state as calculated by  \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) will be affected solely by changes in the magnitudes of x and y, regardless of their rotational position. While the scale alters the magnitude, the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) does not affect the calculation of \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
