  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a time-varying two-dimensional system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant 2x2 matrix. We explore the consequence of intervention through a transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant 2x2 matrix.\n\nAssuming a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at t = 0 and is subsequently projected by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) up to time T, will the resulting vector \\\\(z(T)\\\\) match the trajectory created by evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) from t = 0 to T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\) at t = 0 modifies the starting conditions, hence altering the subsequent evolution path dictated by \\\\(M\\\\). As a result, the trajectory and endpoint at time T will differ due to the influence of \\\\(N\\\\) on the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
