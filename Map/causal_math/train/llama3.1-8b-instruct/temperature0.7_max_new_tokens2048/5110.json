  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, and it evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. Analyze the scenario where a Laplace transform, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(s)) \\\\), is applied, modifying the system's behaviour.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether a Laplace transform was applied at t = 0 by just evaluating the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(s)) \\\\) or the altered initial state, it is not feasible to retrospectively ascertain the application of the transform solely from the observed trajectory, due to potential equivalences in the final form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) arising from different initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
