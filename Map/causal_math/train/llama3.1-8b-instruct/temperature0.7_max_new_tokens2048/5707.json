  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field V(x) and analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax + b \\\\) where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We study the particle's motion in different cases with and without transformations using the operator \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\), where L is the Liouville operator for the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( S(x) = Cx + d \\\\) (where C is another matrix and d is another vector) is applied as an intervention, will the future trajectory till time T depend solely on the untransformed dynamics and not on the specifics of A, b, C, or d?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( S(x) \\\\) as an intervention introduces further changes to the state of the system, compounding the effects of \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and affecting the system's trajectory differently. This means the trajectory until time T will depend on how each transformation alters the dynamics, not just on the original equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
