  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform at \\( t = \\infty \\), can we determine whether the signal was first modified by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) then by \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\), or not modified at all?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences of exponential decays can lead to similar frequency shifts and broadenings. Due to the overlapping effects in the frequency domain alterations caused by multiple interventions, the exact sequence of decay implementations cannot be uniquely determined just by observing the end-state Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
