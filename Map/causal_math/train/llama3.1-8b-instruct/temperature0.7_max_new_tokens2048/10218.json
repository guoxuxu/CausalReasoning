  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nCan we infer the original function around the contour C from the modified integral result of \\\\(\\\\oint_C e^{z^2}/(z-a) dz\\\\), knowing only that a transformation of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) might have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge that \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, and only observing the modified integral, it's impossible to definitively deduce whether the integral involved just \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\) or \\\\(e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\), particularly without extra information about C and \\\\(a\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
