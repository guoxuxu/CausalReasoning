  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and A is a complex constant. The transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B being another complex constant.\n\nIf initially \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, after which it evolves as per \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the state of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{B0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), which seems unchanged. However, this modified initial state, when evolved, reacts differently under dynamics defined by A, especially if A and B are not aligned in terms of their real and imaginary components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
