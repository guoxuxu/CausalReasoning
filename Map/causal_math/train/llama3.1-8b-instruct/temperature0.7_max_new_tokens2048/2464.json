  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) where M is a complex constant matrix. The behavior of the system under the influence of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N \\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with N being another complex matrix, is examined.\n\nCan we definitively decide on what specific transformations or interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), either, or both) have been applied over the period 0 to T based solely on the end resulting observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be the outcome of several potential intervention combinations due to overlaps in the effects and path-dependent processes. Without explicit knowledge of the interventions, multiple scenarios could theoretically lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to determine uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
