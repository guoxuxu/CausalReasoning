  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nFrom the known final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to deduce whether transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both were applied during the system's evolution, solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for varying alterations by M and N, multiple combinations of these transformations along with the natural evolution under D could result in the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The overlapping influences and complex interactions mean we cannot definitively ascertain the exact transformations applied from just the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
