  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is ambiguous because the transformation could fundamentally alter the function's initial state, especially given the dependency on the exponential of N which affects the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
