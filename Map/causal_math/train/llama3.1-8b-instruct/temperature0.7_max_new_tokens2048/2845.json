  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function represents a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane. We examine the response of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming no initial conditions.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Laplace transform without further modification or intervention, will the behavior of the inverse Laplace transformed function match the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transformation of the function and its subsequent inverse transformation are mathematically defined operations, the restored function from its Laplace transform will indeed behave as the original \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The process is reversible in this case, respecting the linearity and time-invariance of the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
