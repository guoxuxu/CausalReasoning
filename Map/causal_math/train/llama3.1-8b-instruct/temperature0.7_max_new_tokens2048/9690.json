  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant. We analyze the influence of performing an inverse Laplace transform under the scenario of differentiating the impulse response associated with H(s).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( ae^{at} \\\\) as the result of differentiation of some impulse response, can we infer that it originated only from the function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing that the differentiated function is of the form \\\\( ae^{at} \\\\), it uniquely corresponds to the derivative of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), implicating the original Laplace transform as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). Hence, the original cause (the Laplace transform function) can be inferred from its effect (the differentiated impulse response).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
