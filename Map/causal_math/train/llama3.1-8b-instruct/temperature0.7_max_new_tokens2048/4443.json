  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + i y(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is examined under this transformation over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\(B\\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively depend on the natural dynamics and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new transformation, which impacts the function's trajectory depending on both A and B. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on the effects of both transformations, not solely on the system’s natural dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
