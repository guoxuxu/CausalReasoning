  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). We explore the implications of modifying the transform by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, on the inverse transformation and how it impacts the original time-domain function.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is modified by multiplying with \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), and then the inverse Laplace Transform is applied, does the resulting function \\\\( h'(t) \\\\) differ from the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by a time shift of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) corresponds to a time shift of the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( H(s) e^{-as} \\\\) transforms back to \\\\( h(t-a)u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the Heaviside step function. This is a time shift and truncation at \\\\( t=a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modification of H(s) → Multiplication by e^(-as); Multiplication by e^(-as) → Shift in inverse transform; Shift in inverse transform → Time shift in h'(t); Time shift in h'(t) → Difference from h(t); Modification of H(s) → Difference from h(t)"
