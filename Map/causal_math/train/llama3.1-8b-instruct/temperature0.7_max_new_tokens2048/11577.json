  "Problem": "Consider a control system influenced by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the scenario under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) applied at time t, with S also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly subjected to evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) modifies the starting vector, impacting the trajectory dictated by the dynamics of M. The transformation \\\\( S \\\\) can change the state's evolution path, leading to a different state at time T compared to an untransformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
