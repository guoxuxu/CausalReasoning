  "Problem": "Examine a control system defined by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix and \\(D\\) is the control input matrix. The analysis covers the impact of a non-linear transformation \\( h(x) = \\sin(Kt) x \\) on the system's state \\(x\\), over time \\(t\\), where \\(K\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), a linear intervention \\( i(x) = Ptx \\) (where \\( Pt \\) is a time-dependent matrix) is applied, does the outcome \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) exclusively depend on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) and not on \\( K \\) or \\( Pt \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional linear intervention \\( i(x) \\) creates a new dynamic whereby \\( x(T) \\) is influenced contextually by \\(C\\), \\(D\\), on top of \\(K\\) from the non-linear scaling, and \\(Pt\\) from the intervention, thus affecting the trajectory and final state of the system in a way that relies on all involved matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
