  "Problem": "Consider a heat transfer system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = a^2u_{xx}\\\\) (typical heat equation) in a rod, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant diffusivity property of the rod. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(x,t)) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and then solving the equation in the transform domain.\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine both the initial condition and the exact nature and timing of any diffusivity changes that occurred?",
  "Explanation": "From the solution at a given time, it is generally not possible to retrospectively determine specific changes in internal parameters like diffusivity or to reconstruct initial conditions without additional information. The outcome does not uniquely specify the pathway or interventions that led to it due to the many potential variables and interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
