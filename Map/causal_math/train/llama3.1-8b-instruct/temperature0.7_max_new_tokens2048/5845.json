  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) is used to transform a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) into a complex function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) of a complex variable \\\\(s\\\\). We then apply an inverse Laplace transform to retrieve \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nIf a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(F(s)\\\\) using the Laplace transform and then immediately recovered through inverse Laplace transform without any modifications to \\\\(F(s)\\\\), will the retrieved function match the original \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse form a pair of linear operations that are theoretically perfect inverses under ideal conditions. Hence, if there is no modification to \\\\(F(s)\\\\), the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is exactly recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
