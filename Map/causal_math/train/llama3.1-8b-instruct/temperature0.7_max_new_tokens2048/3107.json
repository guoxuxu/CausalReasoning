  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. Here A and B are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the integral transform \\\\(F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nSuppose a correction operation \\\\(G[z](t) = z(t) - qt\\\\) (where q is a constant complex number) is applied at \\\\(t = t_1\\\\) and thereafter allowed to evolve. Will the transformed function \\\\(F[z](s)\\\\) only reflect the impact of A and B without regard to the intervention by q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of z(t) by adding the term \\\\(- qt\\\\). This not only changes the values of z(t) but also their subsequent behavior under the transform, integrating effects of the term introduced by q, thus affecting the overall transformation result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
