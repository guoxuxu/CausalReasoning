  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be achievable through various sequences of interventions or even through different parameter adjustments within the original equation. The nonlinearity and complex nature of the interactions between the transformations and the base equation prevent the unambiguous identification of specific interventions from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
