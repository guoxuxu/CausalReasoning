  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled by a differential equation involving complex functions and integral transformations, specifically \\\\(I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)A}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where I is the current, V is the voltage, A is a constant matrix, and t is time.\n\nConsidering the current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) observed at time T, can we precisely pinpoint what interventions (either \\\\(f(V)\\\\), \\\\(g(V)\\\\), or both) were applied merely by analyzing the current value?",
  "Explanation": "Given the influence of non-linear and exponential transformations on the voltage through \\\\(f(V)\\\\) and \\\\(g(V)\\\\) respectively, multiple intervention combinations might produce the same resulting current at T. This condition induces a non-uniqueness issue, preventing precise identification of interventions based on current alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
