  "Problem": "Consider a function space defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). We explore the implications of using an inverse Laplace transform \\\\( f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} \\\\) and applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = tf(t) \\\\) in this space.\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) and knowing the corresponding Laplace transform property, can we uniquely reconstruct \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( G(s) \\), and knowing that \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\) by the property of the Laplace transform for \\\\( tf(t) \\\\), we can uniquely determine \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and thus \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by integration of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and applying the inverse Laplace transform, assuming initial conditions are accounted for or zeroes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
