  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), a basic wave equation where \\\\(c\\\\) is the velocity of wave propagation. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) affects the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\), specifically when considering boundary conditions and time transformations.\n\nCan we determine the initial value \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) and initial velocity \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}(x,0)\\\\) from the Laplace transformed equation \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x,s)\\\\) without performing an inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The initial values and conditions are embedded in the transformed equation as parameters and can be theoretically extracted, but practically, an inverse Laplace transform is necessary to compute these values explicitly in the time domain, as the original conditions are represented over all s (complex frequency space) after transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
