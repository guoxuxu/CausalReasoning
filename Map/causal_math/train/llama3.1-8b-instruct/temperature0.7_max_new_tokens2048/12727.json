  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after interventions with both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we reliably determine which interventions were executed or their sequence, solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or types of interventions involving \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could lead to the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the accumulative and non-linear effects of the transformations and original system dynamics. The overlapping effects of the transformations further obscure which were used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
