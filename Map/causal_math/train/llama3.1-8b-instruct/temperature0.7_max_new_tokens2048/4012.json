  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\) where \\(M\\) is also a diagonalizable matrix and \\(S\\) is the matrix that diagonalizes \\(D\\).\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\( x(T) \\), is it possible to accurately ascertain the specific interventions used (whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( k(x) \\), or both), solely based on the endpoint value \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\( x(T) \\) may result from different transformations due to the properties of matrix exponentiation and the potential for non-commutative effects between \\( e^{Dt} \\), \\( e^{Mt} \\), and \\( e^{Nt} \\). Different combinations of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) can lead to the same \\( x(T) \\), creating inherent ambiguities in deducing the precise interventions purely from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
