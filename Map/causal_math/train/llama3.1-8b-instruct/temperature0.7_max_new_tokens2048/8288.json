  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), with \\\\( F(z) = Az + C \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and C is a constant vector. We analyze the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) applied to this system over time.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine if the transformations \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) were applied at some time before T based solely on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit timestamps or additional information about when transformations are applied, the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) itself doesn't contain sufficient information to deduce the specific interventions (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\)). Various sequences and timings of applying these transformations can lead to similar or identical end states, leading to ambiguities in back-calculating interventions solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
