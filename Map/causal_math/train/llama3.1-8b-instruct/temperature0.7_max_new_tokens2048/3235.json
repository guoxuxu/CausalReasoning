  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation in a vector space under the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{(x-t)^2} f(t) dt \\\\). The system's dynamics are influenced by an externally applied multiplicative function \\\\( g(t) = t^2+1 \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the integration limits, a new function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\cos(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the output \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively depend on the original integrand without being influenced by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) alters the integrand from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, affecting the integrated function within those bounds. Both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) have modified the integrand in different segments of integration, impacting \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\) collectively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
