  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the magnitude and phase of \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\\\), can we ascertain whether the transformation \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) was applied at \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with full knowledge of magnitude and phase of \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\), distinguishing if the changes were due to \\\\\\( z_1 \\\\\\) evolving under the original transformation or due to the intervention \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) is complex. The intervention could either introduce a new magnitude scaling that fits within normal evolution, or it could just fortuitously align with the dynamics of the original transformation \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\). Determining the cause distinctly is therefore not possible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
