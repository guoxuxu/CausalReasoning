  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) over time t, where S is a complex constant. We are analyzing how this transformation interacts with the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is another complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling and rotating the vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), depending on the real and imaginary parts of S. This change in initial conditions results in a different trajectory under the differential equation, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
