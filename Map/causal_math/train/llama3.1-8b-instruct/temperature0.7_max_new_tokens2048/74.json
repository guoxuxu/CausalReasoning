  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to the function, which then defines a new function \\\\( Z(s) = L\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\), is it possible to uniquely identify that the originating function was exclusively \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any other additive functions present?",
  "Explanation": "The unique inferability comes from the properties of the Laplace transform, which is a one-to-one transformation for exponential functions without additive components. The form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\) specifically corresponds to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with no ambiguities.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences the variable s, and the Laplace transform L directly influences Z(s), which in turn influences z(t), which influences z(dot), which is directly influenced by iωz. Since iωz is directly influenced by z and ω is related to s, which is related to Z(s), the Laplace transform L directly influences the relationship between z and ω, leading to the conclusion that the originating function z(t) is uniquely identified as e^(iωt) without any other additive functions present."
