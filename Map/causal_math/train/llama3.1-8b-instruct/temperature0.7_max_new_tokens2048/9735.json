  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at a certain point \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), does the behavior of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) depend solely on the original parameters (\\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) affects the entire system dynamics from the point of intervention, thereby affecting the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\). The modification influences the phase and frequency of the oscillation, resulting in different integrals and consequently a different endpoint compared to if \\\\( \\omega \\\\) had not been changed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
