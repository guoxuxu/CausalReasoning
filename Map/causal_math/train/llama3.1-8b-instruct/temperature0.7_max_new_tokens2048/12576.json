  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0, resulting in a new initial state \\\\( z(0) = b \\\\), and then allowed to evolve with the original complex function without further transformation, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no initial transformation occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L(z) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition to \\\\( z(0) = b \\\\), thereby altering the entire trajectory. The term \\\\( b \\\\) adds a constant shift in the complex plane, which will affect all subsequent positions of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
