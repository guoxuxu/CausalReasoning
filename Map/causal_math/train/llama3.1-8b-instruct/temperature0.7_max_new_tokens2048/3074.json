  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamic system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant square matrix. The impact on the system's trajectory of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also constant matrices, is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the modifications introduced by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) make it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the irreversible effect of matrix D on the trajectory, which may not be uniquely invertible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
