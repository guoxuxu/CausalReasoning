  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants. We investigate how the application of an input signal function transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) impacts the output over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( e^{dt}x(t) \\\\) at the beginning, \\\\( e^{-dt}x(t) \\\\) as an intervention, or both), only by analyzing \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the multiple transformations which can affect the system in nontrivial ways - particularly with modifying the signal in opposite manners (exponential growth and decay) - it’s nearly impossible to infer exactly which transformations were applied based only on the output at time T. This complexity is due to the non-uniqueness of solutions in exponential transformations impacting a dynamic system described by a transfer function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
