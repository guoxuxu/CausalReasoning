  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop control system where the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is passed through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is regulated to meet certain performance specifications. We investigate the implications of introducing a disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) modeled by \\\\( D(s) = \\\\frac{5}{s+2} \\\\) on the output.\n\nCan the effectiveness of the intervention \\\\( K(s) \\\\) in compensating for the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) be unequivocally determined by observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at any given point in time?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) alone provides limited information about the effectiveness of the intervention due to potential variations in the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and other unmodeled dynamics potentially affecting the system. Additional measurements or system modeling would be necessary to conclusively evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
