  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the real and imaginary parts of the complex plane. We are analyzing the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sz} ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) evolves over time without further intervention, will the transformed state at t = T be different from direct application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) yields a different initial condition compared to simply applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\). This transformation accumulates the effects of exponential growth over the interval [0, t], which alters the evolution trajectory of the system distinctly from the direct exponential growth of \\\\( f \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → g(z); g(z) → z_0; z_0 → f(z); t → f(z); f(z) → transformed state; z_0 → transformed state"
