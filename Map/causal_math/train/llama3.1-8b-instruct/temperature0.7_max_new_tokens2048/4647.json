  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real scalar constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the changes in the function under different transformations and interventions, especially focusing on transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real scalar constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, affecting the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) which now depends on B, C, as well as A. The transformations and the additional application of \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influence the system's trajectory, leading to a complex outcome that depends on A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
