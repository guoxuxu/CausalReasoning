  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) =  x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a signal's components in time. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, is it always possible to uniquely determine the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional modifications or information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, if properly defined (considering conditions like the function being square-integrable), uniquely determines \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Provided there's no external tampering or loss of information, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely recovered from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
