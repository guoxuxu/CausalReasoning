  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are variables transformed via integral transformations applied as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\) using the Laplace transform. The transformed function is expressed as \\\\( Z(s) = F(X(s), Y(s)) \\\\). We analyze how these transformations affect the relationships and dependencies between the original functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) into a new function \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) leading to \\\\( X'(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x'(t)\\\\}, \\\\) while keeping \\\\( y(t) \\\\) unchanged, will the resulting \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) reflect only changes due to \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) and not due to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) reflects the influences of both \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and the transformation \\\\( X'(s) \\\\) may introduce new dynamics or interactions not present in the original setting, affecting the interpretation of causal effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
