  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven a trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) over time, can we uniquely identify the initial conditions of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and parameters of \\\\( T \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The complex logarithm function introduces ambiguities related to branch cuts and periodicity. Different initial conditions \\\\( z(0) \\\\) transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) can lead to the same set of values for \\\\( w(t) \\\\), especially due to the periodic nature of the exponential function and the potential for overlapping trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
