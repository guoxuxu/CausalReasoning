  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) over time t, where P is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Qz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Qz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition, impacting the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The presence of matrix P introduces a new dynamic component, which means the state at time T will diverge from that evolved purely under Q, depending on how P and Q interact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
