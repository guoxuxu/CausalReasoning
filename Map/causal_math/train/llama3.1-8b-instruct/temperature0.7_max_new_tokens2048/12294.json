  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( w(z) = D\\\\cdot v(z) \\\\) (where D is another non-zero complex constant) is applied at a point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point z depend only on the transformations \\\\( u(z) \\\\) and not on the specific values of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The final function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is affected by both C and D through the compositions of transformations. Hence, the ultimate form of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( u(z) \\\\) but also critically on the values of C and D, which scale and transform the original function \\\\( u(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
