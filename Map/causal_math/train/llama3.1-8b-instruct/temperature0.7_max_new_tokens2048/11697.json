  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolves over time according to the integral transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) without further mathematical manipulation, will \\\\( G(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T have the same phase as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was processed directly by \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) essentially rotates the complex number z in the complex plane over time, changing its phase but not its magnitude. Given that \\\\( G(z) \\\\) integrates across time, integrating a rotationally altered complex number will accumulate changes in phase, resulting in a different effect compared to a direct application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) on the untransformed initial value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
