  "Problem": "We examine a signal transformation using the Laplace transform in an electrical circuit. The input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is studied in the Laplace domain by applying \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nAssuming an endpoint output in the Laplace domain \\\\( Y_final(s) \\\\) after unknown interventions involving \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or other filters, can the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the type of interventions be determined uniquely from \\\\( Y_final(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the inverse problem here may not be uniquely solvable. Given the same endpoint \\\\( Y_final(s) \\\\), different combinations of inputs and interventions (characterized by various filter functions) could yield similar or identical outputs. Without additional information on the specific interventions or the original input, the inverse mapping cannot be uniquely established.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
