  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\), can we unambiguously deduce \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) incorporates complex factors (including changes in magnitude and phase) dependent on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to the output \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse engineer the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
