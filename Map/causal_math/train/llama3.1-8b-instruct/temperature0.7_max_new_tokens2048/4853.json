  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate how applying different integral kernels, like \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and transformations, impacts the result of the transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed initially using the Laplace transform kernel \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and then allowed to evolve based on its analytical continuation without further modification, will the inverse transformation bring back the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the Laplace transform ensures that if a function is transformed and remains unmodified, its inverse transform under ideal mathematical conditions will retrieve the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), assuming no convergence or analyticity issues.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
