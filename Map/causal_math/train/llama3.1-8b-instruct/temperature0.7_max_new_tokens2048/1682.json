  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the variable s.\n\nGiven the peak of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at a specific s, can we precisely determine the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The peak in the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) exactly determines \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as \\\\( 2\\pi s \\\\), a direct mapping back from the Fourier transform domain to its originating frequency in the time domain. Therefore, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\) can be precisely computed from the effect observed in \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
