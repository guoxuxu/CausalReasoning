  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined over complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz} dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and before \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( g(h(f(z_0))) \\\\) be equivalent to first applying \\\\( h \\\\), then \\\\( f \\\\), and lastly \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations affects the outcome. Applying \\\\( h \\\\) after \\\\( f \\\\) results in \\\\( e^{z_0^2} \\\\), and then the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) on this would not generally yield the same result as switching the order of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\), due to the non-interchangeable nature of exponential and polynomial functions under integral transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
