  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time following the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. Further, investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) at any given time t, where N is another complex constant matrix.\n\nAssuming that at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is a distinct complex constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\) applies a new modification via \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which further complicates the system’s dynamics along with the earlier application of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interactions and individual effects of M, N, and Q, not just M alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
