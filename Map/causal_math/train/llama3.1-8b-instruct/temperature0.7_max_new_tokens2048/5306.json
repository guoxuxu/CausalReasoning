  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) by the operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tA} f(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The transformation is used to analyze the effect of the modified function over the interval [0, x].\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\), can one uniquely recover the original function \\\\( f \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( f \\\\) from \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\) generally requires solving a Volterra integral equation of the first kind. Without knowing A or additional constraints about f, the problem typically does not have a unique solution, making it impossible to definitively recover the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
