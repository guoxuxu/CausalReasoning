  "Problem": "In a control system, consider a scalar linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p z \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a constant parameter. The function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sin(qz) \\\\) is applied, transforming the state, where \\\\( q \\\\) is another constant parameter.\n\nDoes applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at initial time t = 0 affect the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T under the natural evolution according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p z \\\\) without additional intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sin(qz) \\\\) fundamentally alters the state at t = 0. Since sine is a non-linear transformation, the new initial condition affects the evolution under the linear differential equation, leading to behavior distinct from the untransformed initial state evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
