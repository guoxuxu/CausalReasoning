  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), commonly known as the heat equation, where D is a diffusion constant. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation given by \\\\( g(u_0) = u_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a function representing a heat source distribution.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention modifying the temperature distribution directly is applied, does the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Any intervention altering the temperature profile, such as adding or removing heat, impacts the evolution of the temperature distribution. The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will depend on D, the effect of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), and the specific actions taken during the intervention, reflecting a combination of influences on the diffusion process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
