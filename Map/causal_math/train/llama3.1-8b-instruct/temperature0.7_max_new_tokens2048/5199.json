  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Lx \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the system's behavior under the Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf another transformation, say a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( G(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty x(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final function at a later time \\\\( \\Omega \\\\) reflect the impacts of both the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform irrespective of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying both the Fourier and Laplace transforms introduces a combination of frequency and exponential decay effects, which modifies the overall system evolution distinctively. This effect remains irrespective of the underlying linear operational transformation \\\\( L \\\\), as both transforms integrate transformation features over time, modifying the original dynamics distinctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
