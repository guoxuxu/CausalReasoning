  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function on the real-time series data modeled by \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real diagonal matrix. We analyze the scenario where the function \\\\( f(x) = (C*x)^2 \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being another real matrix, is applied to the series.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with a new function \\\\( g(x) = (D*x)^3 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix, will the system status \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces another significant alteration by raising the state vector to the third power after multiplying by \\\\( D \\\\). This change, along with the initial application of \\\\( (C*x)^2 \\\\), makes the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\). These transformations severely influence the trajectory and final condition of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
