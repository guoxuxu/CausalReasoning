  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nIf we apply a modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before the Fourier Transform, will the resulting \\\\( G(f) \\\\) still correspond to the original transformation without the modulation?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a modulation such as \\\\( m(t) \\\\) alters the time domain function to \\\\( g(t)e^{bt} \\\\), which significantly modifies its Fourier transform. The resulting Fourier Transform will reflect the combined effects of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\), thus diverging from the original \\\\( G(f) \\\\) without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
