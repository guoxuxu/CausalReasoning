  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network governed by the Laplace Transform of a complex function \\(\\overline{V}(s) = H(s)\\overline{I}(s)\\), where \\(H(s)\\) represents the system's transfer function and \\(\\overline{V}(s)\\) and \\(\\overline{I}(s)\\) are the Laplace transforms of the voltage and current, respectively. Suppose a filter with a specific impulse response \\( g(t) \\) characterized by its transfer function \\( G(s) \\) is introduced into the network.\n\nAssuming \\( G(s) \\) is inserted and active over the range \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\), will the resulting \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\) be entirely predictable by \\( H(s) \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\( G(s) \\) modifies the transfer characteristic from 0 to T, integrating or altering how the input signal is processed. The resultant \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\) will be shaped by both \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), making it dependent on the combined effect of these transfer functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
