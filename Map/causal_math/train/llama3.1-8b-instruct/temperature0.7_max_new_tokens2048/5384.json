  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). Let us examine the causal effects and inferences in systems characterized by convolution and multiplication operations in the Laplace domain leading to end solutions in time domain.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( H(s)G(s)P(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we conclusively identify which functions served as interventions from \\\\( p(t) \\\\) or alterations in \\\\( g(t) \\\\) based solely on the final transformed product?",
  "Explanation": "Determining precise interventions or alterations in either \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or the influencing function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) based solely on the product \\\\( H(s)G(s)P(s) \\\\) is impossible without further specifics, as multiple interventions or modifications can yield the same resultant transform in the Laplace domain. The overlapping effects of multiplicative operations obscure the direct causality.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
