  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator subjected to complex forcing described by the equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency and C is a complex amplitude. We explore the effects of transformation using the Laplace Transform on the solution.\n\nCan the original initial conditions be deduced exactly from the system endpoint following inverse Laplace Transformation without knowing the specific details of C and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform encodes the system's entire response, and without specific knowledge of the parameters C and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), multiple potential initial conditions can yield similar end states in the transformed domain, complicating exact back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
