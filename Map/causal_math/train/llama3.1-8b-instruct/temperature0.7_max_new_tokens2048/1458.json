  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) in the complex plane defined by the equation \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\), where \\( A \\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{iBs}z(s) ds \\), where \\( B \\) is another real constant.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\) achieved by natural evolution under \\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\), can we infer whether the integral transform was applied during this interval?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( z(T) \\) without knowing the process merely indicates the state at time \\( T \\) without revealing the specific operational transformations like integral transforms, especially since multiple scenarios can lead to the same final state due to the nature of exponential functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
