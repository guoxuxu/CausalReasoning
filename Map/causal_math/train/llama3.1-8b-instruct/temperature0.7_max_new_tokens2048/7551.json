  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by a vector function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( v(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\\\), and subsequently manipulating the system using a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( v(k, t) \\\\), modifying it to \\\\( w(k, t) = H(k)v(k, t) \\\\), will the future state \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined solely by the dynamics of \\\\( L \\\\) without the influence of \\\\( H(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( H(k) \\\\) as an intervention directly manipulates the frequency components of the system's state. This alteration will influence how the system evolves from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), making the final state \\\\( w(k, T) \\\\) dependent on both the original system dynamics \\\\( L \\\\) and the characteristics of \\\\( H(k) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
