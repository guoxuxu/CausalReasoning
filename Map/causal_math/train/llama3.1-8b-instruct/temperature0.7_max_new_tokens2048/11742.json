  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations evolving over time given by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The impact of a Laplace Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))(s) \\\\), is investigated, where s represents a complex variable.\n\nIf a modification operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) such that the new function is \\\\( v(t) = Mu(t) \\\\), and continues to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(s, T) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( L \\\\), ignoring the initial application of operator \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the modification operator \\\\( M \\\\) intervenes in the natural progression by directly altering the function. Therefore, \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(s, T) \\\\) will carry signatures of both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\), showing the dependency on initial conditions modified by \\\\( M \\\\) in addition to the behaviour dictated by \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
