  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of z. The initial state \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) undergoes a transformation via the operation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents a frequency of rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention by a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another frequency) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the natural dynamics of z and not on the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation, contributing a counter-rotational or additional rotational effect depending on the relationship between \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). The final complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations in addition to any inherent dynamics in \\\\( z \\\\), such as growth or decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
