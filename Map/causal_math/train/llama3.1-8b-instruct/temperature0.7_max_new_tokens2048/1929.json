  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the result of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, and no further change to the parameters (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)), will the resultant function at time 2T be the square of the function evaluated at T without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the output by squaring the complex integral result, hence changing the magnitude and potentially the phase of the original timing path of the function, making it different from merely evaluating \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at 2T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z(t); ω → z(t); z(t) → h(z); h(z) → z^2; t → h(z); h(z) → resultant function at 2T; z(t) → resultant function at 2T; resultant function at T → resultant function at 2T; T → resultant function at 2T"
