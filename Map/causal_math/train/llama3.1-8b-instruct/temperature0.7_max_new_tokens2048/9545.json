  "Problem": "We examine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a second-order differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) represents an external driving force. We explore the impacts of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equation up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the initial state dynamically by introducing a time-dependent phase shift. This change affects how the solution responds to the driving force \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), producing a different trajectory and final state at any nonzero T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
