  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant. We investigate how the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where D is a complex constant, affects the system.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) initially modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) by applying a damping and scaling factor determined by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), which changes the development path of the function compared to direct evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\). Thus, the resultant state at time T, considering the initial transformation, would differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
