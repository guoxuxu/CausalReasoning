  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) used within the transformation period without knowing any prior functional form?",
  "Explanation": "The output from the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) represents the cumulative integral of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, losing information about specific points or forms of the function z unless it's uniquely invertible, which in general isn't the case for complex functions over an interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z(t); z(t) → T(z); T(z) → output at time T; output at time T → z(t)"
