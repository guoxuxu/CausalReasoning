  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\\\( F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\), can we determine precisely what intervention was applied (\\e.g., was \\\\\\( g(t) \\\\\\) used, or not), only by knowing \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific effects resulting from the intervention \\\\\\( g(t) \\\\\\) in the form of modified exponential decays can result in the same \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) achievable through different parameters of \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) or potentially other transformations. Without explicit temporal tracking or additional constraints, identifying the exact intervention solely from the final state \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
