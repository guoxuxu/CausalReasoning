  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex number. Analyze the causality and effects of modifying the function by a multiplicative factor \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nHaving the transformed result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we accurately deduce whether the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) before applying the integral transform?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) might appear similarly for different original functions under transformations, and without additional information about the pre-transform function modification or specifics of k, it is not possible to definitively infer the use of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
