  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We explore the behavior of the function under different transformations and integration conditions.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(u) \\\\) where \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\), can you infer the exact form of \\\\( x \\\\) from the original integral without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z(u) \\\\) where \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\) only gives the integral evaluation at that particular transformation. Because multiple values of \\\\( x \\\\) (positive and negative) might yield the same \\\\( u \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( z(u) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
