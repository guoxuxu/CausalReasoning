  "Problem": "In a system analyzed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator, examine the impact of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another transformation, \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\eta}u(x, t)dx \\\\), is applied, will the Fourier transform at T > t_1 depend only on L and not on the initial or intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation G introduces additional changes. The resulting state of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) depends on L, the initial Fourier transformation, and G. The changes induced by G specifically alter how the system's state evolves further, thus affecting the Fourier transform at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
