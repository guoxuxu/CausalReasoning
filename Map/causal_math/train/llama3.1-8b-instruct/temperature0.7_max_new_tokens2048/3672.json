  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyzing the system under the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we pinpoint whether the intervention was the introduction of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or alterations in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) alone, solely based on the form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) may match different sets of conditions and interventions. Changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or the addition of different forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) could conceivably result in similar transforms, obscuring the specific nature of the intervention without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
