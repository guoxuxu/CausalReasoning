  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time and \\\\( s \\\\) the complex frequency domain. We focus on the causal effect of inversion by considering the inverse Laplace transform to recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and examining the impact of additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\) modifies the time-domain function, its application prior to Laplace transformation will change the resulting \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Without knowing whether this transformation was applied, one cannot accurately determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone, because potentially different time-domain modifications (like \\\\( g(t) \\\\)) could yield the same or indistinguishably similar transforms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
