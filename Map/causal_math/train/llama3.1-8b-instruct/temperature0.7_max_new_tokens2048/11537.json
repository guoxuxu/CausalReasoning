  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) and allowed to evolve naturally without applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\), will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after time T be the same as if \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied at each time t?",
  "Explanation": "The natural evolution of \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) represents a movement along the unit circle in the complex plane, while applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) accumulates values of z(t) over time, resulting in a different mathematical object (integral of z(t)) which structurally differs from the mere point \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
