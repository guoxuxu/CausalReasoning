  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the modified transform \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\), can we determine the exact nature of temporal interventions (specifically whether a damping function was applied, and what was the value of \\\\(a\\\\)) only from \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modified transform \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\) will often resemble the convolution with an exponential decay, but distinguishing whether this specific function or another similar transformation was applied, and determining \\\\(a\\\\) precisely from \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\) alone, is generally not feasible due to potential overlaps in effects from different possible interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
