  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate how applying different integral kernels, like \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and transformations, impacts the result of the transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) correctly after observing its transformed version \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without additional data about potential modification during the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective function under certain conditions (sufficient decay, analyticity of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)). Thus, knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and assuming no modification during transformation, the original function can usually be reconstructed precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
