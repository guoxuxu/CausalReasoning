  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\beta)t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are real numbers governing exponential growth and oscillation, respectively.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\(k(z) = e^{(\\\\gamma + i\\\\delta)t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) are real constants, is applied at time t1 as an intervention, does the state at t = T depend uniquely on the parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) regardless of the transformations \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(k(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(k(z)\\\\) at time t1 introduces additional scaling and rotating factors described by \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), affecting the system's trajectory. The resultant state at t = T thus depends on both transformations’ parameters along with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), deeply intertwined in a non-trivial manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
