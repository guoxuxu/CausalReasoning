  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed without intervention, will the nature of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for a given s be the same as simply applying Laplace Transform on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, the transformation from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) follows the direct application of the Laplace Transform, resulting in \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) which is a standard result directly derived from the transformation rule.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
