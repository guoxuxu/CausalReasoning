  "Problem": "Consider a mapping defined by the integral transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) where x(t) is a time-dependent function and s is a complex parameter. We explore how changes in the time-domain function influence the result of the integral transform and vice versa.\n\nIf the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified at time t = 0 (say, multiplied by a constant factor), and the resultant transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is observed without other interventions, will the characteristic features (like poles and zeros) of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) derived at t = T look the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was not modified?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the entirety of the time-domain function which consequently alters the Laplace Transform. The multiplication by a constant factor will scale the transform but can significantly shift the poles or zeros especially if reactive elements (like integration or differentiation in \\\\( x(t) \\\\)) are present.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → X(s); modification → x(t); x(t) → poles and zeros of X(s); modification → x(t) at t = 0; X(s) → poles and zeros of X(s); t = T → X(s)"
