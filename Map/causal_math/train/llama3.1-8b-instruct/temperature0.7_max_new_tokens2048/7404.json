  "Problem": "Consider the response of an electrical system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a matrix describing the system dynamics. The system undergoes a transformation with \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{-Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. The transformations impact the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nBased on the final observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) merely from knowing the state value at \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially be achieved through various combinations or sequences of the transformations \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x) \\\\). The non-linear interactions between the exponential terms and different matrices make it unfeasible to pinpoint exactly which interventions were used based solely on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
