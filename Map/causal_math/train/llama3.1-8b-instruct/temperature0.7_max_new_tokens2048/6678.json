  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( dz/dt = Hz \\\\), where H is a Hermitian matrix. An intervention is applied to the system using a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), with K being a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\) can significantly alter the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without knowing the transformation's application, it's impossible to accurately trace backwards to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the phase shift introduced by the skew-Hermitian matrix K.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
