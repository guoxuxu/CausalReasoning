  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( y \\\\) obtained from solving \\\\( Ay = b \\\\) in the transformed basis, can we conclude that the original state was derived by applying \\\\( T \\\\) to a vector fitting \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Conversion using \\\\( T \\\\) and solving \\\\( Ay = b \\\\) does not ensure that the original state \\\\( x \\\\) directly solves \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), rather it solves \\\\( AT^{-1}y = b \\\\). The assumption that \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) leads directly to \\\\( x \\\\) solving the original system isn't necessarily correct.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
