  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} f(z) dz \\\\). Suppose we further investigate how other transformations like multiplication by a complex constant affect this scenario.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( h(z) = kz \\\\) (where k is a complex constant) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before transforming it to \\\\( g(s) \\\\), will the resulting function solely be influenced by the parameter k in terms of change in singularities and their nature?",
  "Explanation": "While the scaling transformation by k affects the nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), its impact when computing \\\\( g(s) \\\\) involves an interaction between the original singularities of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the scaling factor. This interaction makes the resultant transformation depend on both the nature of f and the scaling parameter k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
