  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( g \\\\) to \\\\( g'(z) = z^3 + c \\\\), will the outcome at time T strictly reveal the effects of the original transformation \\\\( g \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics from \\\\( g \\\\) to \\\\( g' \\\\), fundamentally altering the trajectory of the evolution from that point onwards. The final output at time T will be a result of both the original and modified transformations, making it dependent on both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( g' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
