  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the Fourier Transform is applied to \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), will the result be the same as directly applying the FT to the original signal without modification?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the signal by multiplying with \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) fundamentally changes its spectrum. The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) is shifted in the frequency domain compared to the original (multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) corresponds to a frequency domain translation), resulting in a different frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
