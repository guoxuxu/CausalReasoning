  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system's evolution is governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a positive real constant.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the exact rotation angle by time t remains unspecified. Multiple values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could result in the same \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from different initial conditions, making \\\\( z_0 \\\\) indeterminate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
