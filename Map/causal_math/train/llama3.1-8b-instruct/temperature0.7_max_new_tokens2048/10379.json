  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical system's response to an input signal, and we explore the effects of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with a convolution operation using another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as a convolution filter is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) creating a new function \\\\( f'(t) = (f * g)(t) \\\\) and then transformed to \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\) reflect only the properties of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( f'(t) \\\\), changes the Laplace transform of the resultant function to \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), not just \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
