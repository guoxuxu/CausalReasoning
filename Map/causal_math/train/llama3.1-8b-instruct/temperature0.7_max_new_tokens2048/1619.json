  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) in a region \\( \\Omega \\). An external boundary condition is applied as \\( u = 0 \\) on \\( \\partial \\Omega \\). We investigate the response of the system when subjected to an internal potential \\( f(z) = \\sin(kz) \\), where \\( z \\) and \\( k \\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf at a certain point \\( z_1 \\), a new internal potential \\( g(z) = \\cos(kz) \\) is introduced as an intervention, will the final form of \\( u(z) \\) in \\( \\Omega \\) depend only on the Laplacian \\( \\Delta \\) and not on \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of an additional internal potential \\( g(z) \\) affects the distribution of \\( u(z) \\) throughout \\( \\Omega \\). The harmonic property of \\( u(z) \\) influenced by different internal conditions \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) matters, establishing dependency beyond just the Laplacian operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
