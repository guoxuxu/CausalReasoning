  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a 2x2 matrix. Evaluate the effects of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on this system at different stages.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function resemble the evolution of the untreated system at a given future time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) alters the original function into a complex frequency-domain representation which does not resemble the time-domain behavior of the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) directly. The transformation changes the function fundamentally from time-domain to frequency-domain, which does not capture the specific state dynamics at any time T directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
