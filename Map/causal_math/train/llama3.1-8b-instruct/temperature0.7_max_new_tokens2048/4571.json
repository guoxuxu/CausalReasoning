  "Problem": "Consider the linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. Assess the effects of transforming the system with the operator \\\\( T(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M and N are matrices and N is not necessarily zero.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention operation \\\\( U(x) = Px + Q \\\\) (where P and Q are matrices) is utilized, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and not on M, N, P, or Q?",
  "Explanation": "Both initial transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( U(x) \\\\) introduce changes through matrices M, N, P, and Q. Even after the interruption at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the state of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) still reflects the effects of these transformations, along with the dynamic matrix D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
