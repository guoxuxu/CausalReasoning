  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the spectrum after transformation, can we infer whether the signal was originally multiplied by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without any prior knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the multiplication with \\\\( g(x) \\\\), the changes in the spectrum could be attributed to different causes such as environmental noise or initial signal conditions, since many modifications could yield similar spectral changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
