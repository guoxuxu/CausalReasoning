  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nCan one determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied at times \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and \\\\(t_1\\\\) respectively, merely by observing the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact transformations applied just by observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is not feasible due to the mathematical properties of matrix multiplication and exponential, where different combinations of \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(N\\\\), and initial conditions \\\\(C\\\\) can yield the same final state under certain conditions. This ambiguity prevents a unique determination of the applied transformations without further data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
