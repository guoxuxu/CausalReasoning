  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a system governed by the convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specified as \\\\( y(t) = x(t) \\\\ast h(t) \\\\). Consider two functions, \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h_2(t) = t \\\\ast h_1(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we unequivocally identify whether the input was convolved with \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) first?",
  "Explanation": "From the output alone, without additional data on the functional form of \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), it's ambiguous whether the input signal was first convolved with \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) followed by \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), or directly with \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\). The convolution operations can result in similar transformations, particularly with overlapping effects from the impulse responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
