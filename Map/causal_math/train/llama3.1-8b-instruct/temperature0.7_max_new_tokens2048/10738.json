  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nIf you know the state of a particle at time T, \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can you determine unambiguously the initial conditions at t = 0 (i.e., whether \\\\(e^{Nt}x_0\\\\) or just \\\\(x_0\\\\) was used), knowing only that the evolution is governed by M?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the initial transformation \\\\(e^{Nt}\\\\) was applied, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) doesn't provide enough information to deduce the exact initial state (whether it was \\\\(e^{Nt}x_0\\\\) or \\\\(x_0\\\\)), especially since both transformations alter the trajectory potentially in a non-recoverable way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
