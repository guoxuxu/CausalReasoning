  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Sz \\\\), where S is a constant matrix. The study focuses on the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) implemented at various times t, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nBased on the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to accurately identify which transformations were applied (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or both) solely from knowing the state at T?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity arises because various combinations of transformations and their timings (applying D, F, both, or none) might lead to identical or indistinguishable endpoints at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially if the matrices D and F do not have distinct, easily separable effects. The overlap in possible system responses makes exact identification challenging without further context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
