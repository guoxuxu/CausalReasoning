  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect on complex numbers in the context of the complex plane transformation. We investigate how this transformation influences the properties of integration along a closed contour C, before and after specific interventions.\n\nIf we apply a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after initially applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the integral along \\\\( C \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect the cumulative effects of both transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of both transformations \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) will cumulatively alter the contour path and impact the integral. Each transformation affects the shape and properties of the contour, so the final integral will reflect the effects of both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
