  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by only observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\) affects both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), complicating back-calculation. Without knowing whether and how the transformation was applied, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the potential phase shift and scaling.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
