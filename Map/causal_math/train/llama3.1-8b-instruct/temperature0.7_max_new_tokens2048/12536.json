  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is applied to an input function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) in a linear system defined by the integral transform \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response. An additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is considered as an intervention.\n\nIf initially \\\\( x(t) = f(t) \\\\) is set, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( y(T) \\\\) be influenced by the specific form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) directly depends on the system's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), as the convolution operation integral involves the interaction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) with the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → y(t); x(t) → h(t); h(t) → y(t); g(t) → x(t); C → g(t); C → x(t); f(t) → x(t)"
