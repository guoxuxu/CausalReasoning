  "Problem": "Consider a system where a matrix function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dx} = M u(x) \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix. We also look into the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{Nx} u(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is initially a constant vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\) and evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dx} = Mu(x) \\\\), will applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) after evolution without any intervention change the resulting transformation as compared to directly applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) to \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( T(u) \\\\) applied to the untransformed initial vector and to the evolved vector under \\\\( M \\\\) yields different results, as the transformation due to \\\\( M \\\\) changes the components of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) which are then differently weighted by \\\\( e^{Nx} \\\\) in the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
