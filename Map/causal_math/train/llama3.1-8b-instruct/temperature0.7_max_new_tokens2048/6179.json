  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) governing the displacement \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of a string, where \\\\(c\\\\) is the wave speed. To analyze this system, we consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\), transforming the equation into a simpler form.\n\nSuppose an additional damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant) is introduced as an intervention at time \\\\(t_0\\\\). Does the final state \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_0\\\\) only depend on the wave equation without regard for \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor modifies the equation governing the system's evolution from \\\\(t_0\\\\) onwards, leading to a different solution that now also depends on the parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) in addition to the parameters of the original wave equation.",
