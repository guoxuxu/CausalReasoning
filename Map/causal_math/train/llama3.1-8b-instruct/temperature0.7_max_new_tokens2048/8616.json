  "Problem": "Assume we are dealing with a circuit system characterized by a linear transformation given by a matrix product \\\\( R = MC \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix representing the Maxwell's equations and \\\\( C \\\\) represents electrical properties of materials like capacitance and resistance.\n\nGiven the response matrix \\\\( R \\\\) at a later time, can we exactly determine which elements of matrix \\\\( C \\\\) were altered during the intervention, solely based on the information in \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of how the intervention altered \\\\( C \\\\), multiple configurations of changes in \\\\( C \\\\) combined with the propagation governed by \\\\( M \\\\) could result in the same final matrix \\\\( R \\\\). Hence, we cannot uniquely pinpoint the changes in \\\\( C \\\\) solely based on \\\\( R \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
