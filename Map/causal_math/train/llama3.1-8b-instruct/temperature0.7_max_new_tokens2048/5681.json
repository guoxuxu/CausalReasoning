  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nIf the initial function \\( u(0, x) \\) is transformed by the Fourier transform, and then \\( u(t, x) \\) evolves according to the original PDE without further intervention, will the evolution in \\( \\xi \\)-space for \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) \\) at time \\( T \\) be indicative of the same physical phenomena as if \\( u(0, x) \\) had merely been propagated through the PDE directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts the PDE into a simpler equation involving only the time derivative and multiplication, hence preserving the behavior of wave characteristics in frequency space, corresponding to the same underlying phenomena.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
