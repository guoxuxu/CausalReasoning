  "Problem": "Consider a complex integration scenario described by a contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) around a closed path C in the complex plane, where \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to analyze the integral in terms of real time dynamics.\n\nObserving a change in the value of the contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\), can we definitely conclude there was a change in the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) without any information on interventions?",
  "Explanation": "While a change in \\\\(a\\\\) can affect the integral, other factors could also alter the outcome, such as changes in the path C or even external transformations not accounted in the scenario. Without additional information, we can't exclusively attribute changes to \\\\(a\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
