  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analysis is conducted on the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), which transforms the function of time \\\\(u(t)\\\\) into a function of complex variable s.\n\nBased on the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) observed, can we determine precisely whether it was influenced by the original operator L or the intervention operator M?",
  "Explanation": "Given the resulting transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\), it's not possible to definitively trace back to specific operators due to the integral transformation concealing the distinction between modifications from L and M unless additional information about initial or boundary conditions is available.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
