  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of modifying \\\\( s \\\\) and using an intervention function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nAfter observing the outcome \\\\( S(z) \\\\), can we conclude the exact form of the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the exact value of \\\\( s \\\\) used, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation involving exponential terms can mask the original signal characteristics, especially since different combinations of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can yield similar outcomes, particularly without knowing the boundaries of integral and specifics of the signal decay or growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
