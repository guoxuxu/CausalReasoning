  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we uniquely recover the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the Fourier transform's spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the delta function nature of the Fourier transform for \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the peak's location in the spectrum uniquely determines the original function's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). There's no ambiguity about this frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
