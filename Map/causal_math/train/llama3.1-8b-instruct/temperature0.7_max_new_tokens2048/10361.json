  "Problem": "Imagine a continuous system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) as a transformation that acts on the state variable u.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T match the evolution of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) under the same equation without applying \\\\( F(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition changes the characteristic modes of the system, influencing how the solution evolves under the differential operator L. This potentially modifies how frequencies interact over time, leading to a different state at time T than if the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) were evolved directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
