  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation maps a function from the time domain to the Laplace transform in the complex domain.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is altered by substituting a continuous function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) for \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and this is the only change made before finding \\\\( G(z) \\\\), will the new transform \\\\( H(z) \\\\) be equal to \\\\( G(z) \\\\) for all \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to include \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the function being transformed, thus affecting the outcome of the Laplace transform. The new function \\\\( H(z) \\\\) will generally not be the same as \\\\( G(z) \\\\) unless \\\\( h(t) \\\\) satisfies very specific criteria that make it equivalent to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → G(z); f(t) → H(z); f(t) → h(t) → G(z) is not directly influenced, but the transformation of f(t) is altered; z → G(z); z → H(z)"
