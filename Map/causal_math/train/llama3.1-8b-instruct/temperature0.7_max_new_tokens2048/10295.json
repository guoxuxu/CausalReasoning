  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) on the solution u(x, t), with K being a kernel function.\n\nIf at some instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( R(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} H(x, s) u(s, t) ds \\\\) (where H is another kernel function) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the transforms T and R?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will depend on both transformations T and R, as well as the evolution under L. These transformations can modify the solution path and effect in a compounded manner, determined by the convolution properties of both kernels K and H with the linear operator L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
