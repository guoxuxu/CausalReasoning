  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nGiven \\( y(t) \\), can we unequivocally infer \\( x(t) \\) without knowing \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\( H(f) \\), it's impossible to accurately deduce \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) because the transformation \\( H(f) \\) could modify \\( X(f) \\) in ways that cannot be reverse-engineered without precise knowledge of \\( H(f) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
