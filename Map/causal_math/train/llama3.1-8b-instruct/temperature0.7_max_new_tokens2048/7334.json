  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a two-dimensional space, \\(\\Delta u = 0\\), where \\(u(x,y)\\) is the potential function. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to convert the problem into its frequency domain representation, allowing analytical manipulation by \\(\\mathcal{F}[u](k_x, k_y) = U(k_x, k_y)\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\(u(x,y)\\) at any past state after observing \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) at a current time without knowing the precise time at which the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the time-invariant nature of harmonic functions under the Laplace equation, knowing \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) allows for the exact recovery of \\(u(x,y)\\) at any past state using the inverse Fourier transform, despite not knowing the specific time of transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
