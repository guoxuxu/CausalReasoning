  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) of a function u(t), where u(t) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0 \\\\). Consider an intervention where a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is introduced to the solution u(t) before transforming it.\n\nIf the function u(t) is modified by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) and then transformed using Laplace, will the transformed function \\\\( U(s) \\\\) only depend on the parameters of the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) significantly alters the Laplace transform's outcome. This action effectively changes the function being transformed, leading to a dependency not only on the original equation's parameters but also on the exponential factor used, which introduces additional terms in the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Multiplication of u(t) with e^{st} → Modification of u(t); Original differential equation parameters → Modification of u(t); Modification of u(t) → Laplace transformation; Laplace transformation → U(s); U(s) → Dependence on original differential equation parameters"
