  "Problem": "A continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. Let us consider the influence of a transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory again by introducing an additional scaling factor. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the original rotational speed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as well as the scaling factors contributed by both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Their combined effects mean that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not solely dictated by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
