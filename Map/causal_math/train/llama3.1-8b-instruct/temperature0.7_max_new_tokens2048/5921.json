  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing periodic motion in the complex plane, modifies a dynamical system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a diagonalizable matrix. Consider the effects of transforming the state by applying the function \\\\( h(z, x) = z(t) \\\\cdot x \\\\) at an initial time 't'.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) up to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\) incorporates a complex multiplication which modifies the initial conditions by adding a rotation in the complex plane dependent on the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This initial phase shift affects the system's trajectory, making it different from the straightforward evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
