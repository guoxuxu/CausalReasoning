  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) in which \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a trajectory in the complex plane. We are given that the trajectory evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We also consider the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on A but also on B and C. The successive applications of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affect the dynamics and the eventual position of the system at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
