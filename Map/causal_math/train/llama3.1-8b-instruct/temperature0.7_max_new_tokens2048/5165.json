  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z \\\\) on the complex plane defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix. We investigate how the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also being a real matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial state to \\\\( e^{B0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), and thus does not alter the initial vector at t = 0. However, for subsequent times, the evolving rules under the dynamical systems are different due to the compound transformation involving \\\\( B \\\\). Thus, the state at time T under \\\\( f \\\\)'s transformation, followed by evolution through \\\\( A \\\\), will differ from the unaltered evolution under \\\\( A \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
