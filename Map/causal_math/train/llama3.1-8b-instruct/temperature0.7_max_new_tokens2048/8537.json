  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) with kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then the PDE is solved without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be equivalent to solving the PDE with the original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to the initial condition changes the input to the PDE. Since \\\\( T[u(x,0)] \\\\) typically alters the initial state, the evolution governed by \\\\( L \\\\) will produce a different solution compared to using \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
