  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then is allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the end result at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if it was simply evolved naturally without application of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) by integrating it over time multiplied by an exponential factor. This process fundamentally changes the trajectory of the function, leading to a difference in the end result at time \\\\( T \\\\) compared to natural evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
