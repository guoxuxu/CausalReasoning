  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) that describes heat diffusion in a rod. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{w x} \\\\), where w is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial profile by adding \\\\( e^{w x} \\\\), which affects the solution to the heat equation. The solution will differ from the profile evolved directly from \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at time T because the added exponential term evolves differently under the heat equation.",
