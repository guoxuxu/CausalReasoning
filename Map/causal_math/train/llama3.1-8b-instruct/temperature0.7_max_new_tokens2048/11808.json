  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) solely depend on the properties of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) without any external factors?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) acts directly on the complex function, integrating it over the specified interval. The outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depends only on the behavior of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) in the interval from 0 to T under the given transformation, without additional influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
