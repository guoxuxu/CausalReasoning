  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), particularly under the influence of a derivative operation, defined by \\\\( g(t) = d^n(t) / dt^n \\\\) where n is a positive integer.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) after an nth derivative operation, can we exactly reconstruct the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without knowing the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\) which was obtained after applying the nth derivative requires knowledge of initial conditions (such as \\\\(f(0), f'(0), ..., f^{(n-1)}(0)\\\\)), which carry crucial information lost in the transformation. Without this, the exact form of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
