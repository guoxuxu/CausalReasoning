  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the outcome of an integral of \\( f(z) \\) for different path deformations (e.g., contours sidestepping all poles), can one deduce whether an intervention occurred or if it was the original cause that influenced the resultant integral?",
  "Explanation": "Given that different paths (original or deformed) around or removing all poles lead to an integral of zero, one cannot conclusively trace back and determine if the result was due to the original function setup or a path intervention. The impactful nature of contour deformations in complex integration conceals the causative process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
