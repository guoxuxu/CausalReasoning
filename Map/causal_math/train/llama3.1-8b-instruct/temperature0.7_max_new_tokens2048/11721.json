  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(u) = e^{Mt}u\\\\), where M is another linear differential operator, on the evolution of function u over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(h(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(u)\\\\) at t=0 modifies the initial condition from \\\\(u_0\\\\) to \\\\(e^{Mt}u_0\\\\), and the evolution under L from this altered state is generally different due to the differential properties of L and M, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
