  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a differential operator. In this scenario, we explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = L[x] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator, applied at a specific time.\n\nCan we explicitly determine what transformations were applied (either \\\\( L[x] \\\\) or \\\\( M[x] \\\\), or both) simply by analyzing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may reflect complex interactions between the transformations \\\\( L[x] \\\\) and \\\\( M[x] \\\\) with the system's dynamics under \\\\( D \\\\). The overlap in potential effects and the non-exclusive nature of the transformations make it impossible to uniquely identify which operations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
