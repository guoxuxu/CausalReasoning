  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new temperature regulating function \\\\( g(u) = e^{-\\mu t}u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected only by the parameter k and not by \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) further modifies the system by scaling it with another exponential decay factor, \\\\( e^{-\\mu t} \\\\). Therefore, the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial transformation as well as the new intervention, making it dependent on k, \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), and \\\\( \\mu \\\\), showing how multiple factors interactively affect the heat distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
