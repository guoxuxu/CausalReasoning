  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nDoes transforming the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0(x)) \\\\) and then evolving according to the PDE change the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t compared to evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition changes the representation of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) into frequency space, thereby modifying how the differential operator L acts on it through its differential properties. This can lead to a different solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) compared to the direct evolution of the untransformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
