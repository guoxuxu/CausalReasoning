  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant vector. Let the impact of an operational matrix B be scrutinized via the transformation \\\\( h(s) = B \\\\cdot g(s) \\\\) where B commutes with A.\n\nBased on the knowledge of \\\\( i(s) \\\\) and knowing B and C commuted during the transformation, can we uniquely identify and differentiate the sequence or specific intervention times of B and C?",
  "Explanation": "Despite knowing B and C acted on the transform, their commutative properties mean we can't derive the sequence or precise times of their interventions just from \\\\( i(s) \\\\). This commutation allows for the equivalence of their operational effect irrespective of the order or specific timing of application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
