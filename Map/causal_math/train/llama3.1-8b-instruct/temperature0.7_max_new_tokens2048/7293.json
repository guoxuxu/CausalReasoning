  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator on function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\). To analyze the system's behavior, we explore the effect of applying Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), particularly focusing on the transformation over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, 0)\\\\) is calculated at time t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the PDE without further intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, t)\\\\) at t = T represent the same transformed state, as if we evolved \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) under the PDE and then applied the Fourier transform at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a linear PDE, under proper conditions, commutes with time evolution governed by the PDE. This means the initial transformed state under the evolution operator \\\\(e^{L t}\\\\) correctly evolves in the transform space, maintaining consistency between evolving the state first and then transforming, versus transforming first and then evolving the transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
