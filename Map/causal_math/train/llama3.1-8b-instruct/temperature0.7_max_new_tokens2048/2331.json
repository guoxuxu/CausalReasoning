  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) defined on complex numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( f \\) being a holomorphic function. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) concerning variable \\( y \\) and the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\) concerning variable \\( x \\) are used to analyze transformed functions.\n\nIf \\( f \\) is modified at a certain point \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) by introducing an additional term \\( g(x, y) \\), a holomorphic intervention, does the end transform only depend on the initial form of \\( f \\) or both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( g(x, y) \\) as an intervention in \\( f(x, y) \\) alters both the Fourier and Laplace transforms' results due to the linear yet independent impact on the input function. The final transform will reflect the characteristics of both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
