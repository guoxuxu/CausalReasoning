  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. Let \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) be the velocity field, and suppose a transformation by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a stream function representing a perturbation.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) was introduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the perturbation introduction, reversing the Navier-Stokes equations to determine the initial condition \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\) would yield multiple potential solutions, especially considering the sensitivity to initial conditions and the possible chaotic nature of the flow.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
