  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a Hermitian matrix and i is the imaginary unit, defining oscillatory dynamics. We explore the consequences of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "It is impossible to uniquely backtrack the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without clear knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), as the transformation influenced by B could have altered initial conditions significantly compared to the hypothetical unaffected pathway (purely under \\\\( iAz \\\\)). The introduction of phase changes by B obscures the historical trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
