  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency of oscillation in radians per second. This defines a system where \\( z(t) \\) traces a circular path in the complex plane. Investigate the impact of a linear transformation \\( L(z) = Az + b \\) with complex constants A and b.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( M(z) = Cz + d \\) is applied as an intervention, where C and d are complex constants, will the resulting trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) depend only on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( A \\), \\( b \\), \\( C \\), or \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\( M(z) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) adds another level of complexity, affecting both the scale and the position of the trajectory in the complex plane. The final trajectory will be influenced by the compositions of \\( A \\), \\( b \\), \\( C \\), and \\( d \\) along with the frequency \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
