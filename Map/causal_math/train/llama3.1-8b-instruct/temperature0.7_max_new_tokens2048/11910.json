  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear dynamical system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix defining the system dynamics, C is the control matrix, and u is a control input function. To analyze the impact, we introduce an external transformation function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mx} \\\\), where M is also a constant matrix that modifies the state x.\n\nIf an intermediate control change \\\\( u(t_1) \\\\) is applied at t = t_1, then another transformation \\\\( j(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by D and not influenced by M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The system's final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by the initial exponential transformation due to M, the dynamics matrix D, the control matrix C through changes in u, and the subsequent transformation due to N. Each of these components, especially the exponential transformations, contribute to the system's evolution and lead to a state at T that reflects this compounded influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
