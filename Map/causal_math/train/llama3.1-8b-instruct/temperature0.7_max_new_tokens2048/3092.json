  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where u and v are real functions of time and governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) over time t, where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were used (be it \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on knowing the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity of intervening transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), as well as their matrix compositions, create multiple potential trajectories that could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Hence, just knowing the final state cannot provide sufficient information to deduce the exact transformations or sequence of interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
