  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z(T) \\\\) is applied at time T, will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) rely exclusively on the original differential equation parameters without influence from the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time T introduces a new factor, modifying \\\\( z(T) \\\\) directly. This adjustment hence makes the final state dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the nature of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which scales and potentially rotates the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
