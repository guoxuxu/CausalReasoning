  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(w(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex number. The system is then studied under the transformation, \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t) dt \\\\), an integral transform with parameter \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(w(z)\\\\) to \\\\(w(z) = e^{(z+i)^2}\\\\) at a certain \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the outcome of \\\\(g(w)\\\\) at \\\\(s = s_0\\\\) now depend only on the original function without considering the effect of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention effectively changes the trajectory of \\\\(w(z)\\\\) from that point onwards, causing a different evolution under the squared and exponential transformations with the additional imaginary unit shift. Since this affects all subsequent behavior of \\\\(w(z)\\\\), the result of \\\\(g(w)\\\\) at any \\\\(s\\\\) will now incorporate effects from both the original function and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
