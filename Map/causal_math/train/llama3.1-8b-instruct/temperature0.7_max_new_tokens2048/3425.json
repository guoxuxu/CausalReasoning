  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where x is a fixed complex number, and A is a complex constant. We investigate the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from initial point \\\\( x \\\\) according to the function \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at any time t be different from just integrating \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\) from 0 to t?",
  "Explanation": "As the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is directly calculated from the output \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) without any modification, \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{As}x ds \\\\) directly corresponds to integrating the function over time t. There is no alteration in the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a consistent result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
