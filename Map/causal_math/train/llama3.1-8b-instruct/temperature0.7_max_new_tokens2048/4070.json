  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( w_0 \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time. This function is subject to transformations by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed function at time T, can we determine if the original function was solely \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\) without any additional information about the kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) used in the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), it is not feasible to reverse-engineer or reliably deduce the precise original form of the function, as the transformed output could result from various potential originals modified by different kernels.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
