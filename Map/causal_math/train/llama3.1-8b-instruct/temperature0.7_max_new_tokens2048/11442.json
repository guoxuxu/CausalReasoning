  "Problem": "Consider a linear differential operator \\\\(L\\\\), and assume we have a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(Lu = 0\\\\. We explore how the application of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t) dt\\\\), affects the system and the implications of causal inference in this scenario.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x, t)\\\\}\\\\) of the solution at a later time t without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace transform of the solution, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x, t)\\\\}\\\\), we can apply the inverse Laplace transform to recover the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) over time. From this, extracting the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) is straightforward, assuming the transform and its inversion are properly defined and the necessary conditions for inversion are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
