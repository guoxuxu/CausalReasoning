  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbing functional transformation \\\\( P(z) = z + \\\\delta e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) are constants) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), how does this affect the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at times \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) when compared to the untouched system?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation \\\\( P(z) \\\\) introduces an additive adjustment that persists over time because of the exponential nature of \\\\( \\\\dot{z} \\\\), thereby altering the subsequent trajectory from what would have resulted without any intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
