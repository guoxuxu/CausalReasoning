  "Problem": "Consider a physical system described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a linear operator. To analyze different scenarios, the Laplace Transform \\( L(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\) is applied, affecting the system's characteristics over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by another operator \\( H \\) is applied, where \\( H(x) = x + h \\), with h a constant vector, will the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on D, not on any other factors?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( H(x) \\) modifies the system by adding h, thus the final state \\( x(T) \\) depends on both the original operator D and the intervention H. This addition shifts the trajectory of \\( x(t) \\) and alters the endpoint \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
