  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and the function maps a real value \\\\(t\\\\) to a point on the complex unit circle. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Az\\\\), where A is a complex square matrix, at different times.\n\nIf an intervention applying a secondary linear transformation \\\\(g(z) = Bz\\\\) (where B is another complex matrix) is done at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the system at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reflect an influence primarily from \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), but not from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains significant since it dictates the fundamental frequency of oscillation on the unit circle. The intervention with \\\\(B\\\\) on top of \\\\(A\\\\) does not eliminate or overshadow the underlying dynamics governed by e^{i\\\\omega t}, and hence the system's state is influenced by \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
