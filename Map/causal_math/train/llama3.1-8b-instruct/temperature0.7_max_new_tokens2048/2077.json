  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature \\( T \\) across a rod varies over time and can be described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution as \\( f(T) = T_0 + h \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) where \\( T_0 \\) is the initial uniform temperature, \\( h \\) is the amplitude, and \\( \\\\omega \\) the frequency of the heat variation.\n\nIf \\( f(T) \\) sets the initial temperature distribution and the system evolves according to the heat equation without further alteration, will the temperature distribution at a later time \\( t = T \\) replicate the initial pattern introduced by \\( f(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diffusion nature of the heat equation, the initial sinusoidal variation introduced by \\( f(T) \\) will diminish over time. The temperature distribution will tend to become uniform, with variations decreasing as \\( t \\) increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
