  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system described by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is defined in the complex domain. Let's analyze an intervention using an inverse mapping \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is another complex function.\n\nCan we accurately recover the original time function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the intermediate transformation value \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t = T \\\\) given no additional information or intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Given the properties of the Laplace transform as a bijective mapping in suitable function spaces, the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) using the inverse Laplace transform, provided the conditions of the transform's applicability are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
