  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t that satisfy a coupled differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. We investigate how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), impacts causal inference.\n\nBased on knowledge of \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T and the matrix coefficients A, B, C, and D, can we identify exactly which matrix intervention \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T provides information integrated over time and affected by both the system dynamics and the intervention. Multiple different interventions \\\\( M \\\\) could lead to similar effects in the frequency domain due to underlying complexities and potential non-linearities in how changes in state propagate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
