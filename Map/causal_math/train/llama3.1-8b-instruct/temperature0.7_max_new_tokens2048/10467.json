  "Problem": "We consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore scenarios involving the integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, to analyze how transformations and interventions affect the system.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) (a nonzero complex constant) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\alpha z(t) \\\\), will the transformed endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) be independent of the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given that the intervention \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Though the intervention explicitly scales the function, the integral transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\) still depends both on the new scaled trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the original initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The scaling affects how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) contributes to the transform, thus the endpoint of the transform incorporates details of both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
