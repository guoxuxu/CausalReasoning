  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time. The function is impacted initially by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) (where A is a complex constant and t is time). We analyze the effect of an operational matrix L of the Laplace transform applied to z(t).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied where B is another complex constant, is the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, dependent exclusively on the original operation A?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another vector of change, resulting in a state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that depends on both the original transformation through A and the intervention B. The combined effect of both exponential transformations can fundamentally alter the evolution path and thus the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
