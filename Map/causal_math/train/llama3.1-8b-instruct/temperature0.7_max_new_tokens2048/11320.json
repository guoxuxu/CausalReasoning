  "Problem": "We are given a complex system where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) modifies a vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a vector space over the complex numbers. The angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is constant, and the system evolves according to the operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x = -i\\omega x \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system with and without interventions involving a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we ascertain precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information, multiple combinations of the values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and transformations \\\\( A \\\\) could result in the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The lack of unique determinability is due to the potential complex interaction between phase shifts and transformation impacted by \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
