  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation by the function \\\\( g(u) = U(t)u \\\\), with \\\\( U(t) \\\\) being a unitary operator, is conducted.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new unitary operator \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the eventual state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on L and not on the nature of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) or \\\\( V(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with another unitary operator \\\\( V(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics that interfere with the originally set trajectory by \\\\( U(t) \\\\). The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) becomes a product of the interactions between \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), and the operator L, thus dependent on all these elements.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
