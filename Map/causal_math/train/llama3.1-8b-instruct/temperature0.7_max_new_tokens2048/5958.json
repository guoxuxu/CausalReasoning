  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) being constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) representing control input. We investigate the effect when applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to the state vector.\n\nCan we infer the exact form of the control \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and matrix \\\\(D\\\\) by analyzing \\\\(X(s)\\\\) alone, after transformation and system evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformed state \\\\(X(s)\\\\) encodes information in the frequency domain, which lacks direct indications of time-domain specifics such as control actions and the dynamics reflected in \\\\(D\\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) might yield similar \\\\(X(s)\\\\), making exact inference unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
