  "Problem": "Examine the response of a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Consider applying the Fourier transform \\\\(F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) to the function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and then analyzing its evolution under a given boundary condition transformation.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial function \\\\(f_0(x, y)\\\\) accurately by observing \\\\(f(x, y, t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, it is difficult to backtrack the changes induced by spatial to frequency domain transformations, especially since boundary conditions might alter the natural evolution of the original system in unpredictable ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
