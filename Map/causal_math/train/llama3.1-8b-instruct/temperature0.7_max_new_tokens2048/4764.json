  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and we apply a Fourier transform to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\) to convert it to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}_t = -k\\\\omega^2\\\\hat{u}\\\\). We are interested in analyzing how transformations in the frequency domain using a function \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2 t}\\\\hat{u} \\\\) affect the system's behavior over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\), \\\\( g(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\), or both), based solely on the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\) can result from different combinations of interventions due to the linear superposition principle applicable in the frequency domain. The effects of applying different exponential decay factors individually or in combination can result in similar outcomes, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact history of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
