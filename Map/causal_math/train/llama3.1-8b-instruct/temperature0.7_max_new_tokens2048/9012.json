  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time t, governed by the set of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine the effects of a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) performed at time t = 0.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify both the initial application of the Laplace transform and the subsequent inverse Fourier transformation on \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just from the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the specific transformations applied (both the initial Laplace transform and the later inverse Fourier transform on \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) solely from observing the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is not feasible. Multiple transformation scenarios could yield the same or similar state due to the overlapping effects and multiple possible state paths influenced by A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
