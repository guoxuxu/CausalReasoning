  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\) with constants \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). Analysis investigates how operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can deduce properties or behaviors of functions over time and under transformations.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( n \\\\) at a specific time such that \\\\( f(t) \\\\) changes shape from \\\\( t^n e^{at} \\\\) to \\\\( t^{n+k} e^{at} \\\\), will the change be exclusively reported by \\\\( s \\\\) in the new Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{t^{n+k}e^{at}\\\\}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing \\\\( n \\\\) to \\\\( n+k \\\\) adds a polynomial factor, adjusted in the Laplace transform through the increase in order of the derivative under the numerator. This direct modification will manifest distinctly in the transform modified by the factor \\\\( s^{-k} \\\\), reflecting entirely in the new expression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
