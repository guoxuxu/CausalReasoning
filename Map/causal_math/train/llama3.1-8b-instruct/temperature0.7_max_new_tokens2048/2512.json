  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation system controlled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) applied to a set of differential equations. We explore scenarios involving both the initial application of transforms and subsequent interventions through inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}[F(s)] \\\\) at different stages.\n\nCan we precisely identify if any interventions (transformations like \\\\( L^{-1}[G(s)] \\\\)) were applied by knowing the endpoint state \\\\( f(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The relationship between the original and the endpoint state in the presence of interventions could be confounded by multiple feasible operations (like additional transforms and inverse transforms), each leading to the same or indistinguishable endpoints due to the properties of linear transformations in the Laplace plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
