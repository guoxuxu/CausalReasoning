  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original value of \\( p \\) after observing the behavior of \\( f(t) \\) at a later time without knowledge of any alteration to \\( p \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\( p \\) was altered (or by how much), reconstructing the original value of \\( p \\) from the evolved function \\( f(t) \\) is not feasible as multiple values of \\( p \\) can produce similar behaviors under certain conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "p → F(s); p → F(t); F(s) → f(t); q → G(s); G(s) → g(t); g(t) → f(t) by convolution; f(t) → behavior at later time; behavior at later time → inference about p"
