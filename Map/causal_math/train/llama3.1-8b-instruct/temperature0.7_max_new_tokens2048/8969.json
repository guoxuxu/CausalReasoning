  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function on the real-time series data modeled by \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real diagonal matrix. We analyze the scenario where the function \\\\( f(x) = (C*x)^2 \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being another real matrix, is applied to the series.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to if the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was not applied at all?",
  "Explanation": "The square operation and multiplication by \\\\( C \\\\) fundamentally alter the initial state. The trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will evolve differently from that of \\\\( e^{At}x_0 \\\\) due to the non-linear transformation applied initially by \\\\( (C*x_0)^2 \\\\), hence leading to a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
