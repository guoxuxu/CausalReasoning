  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 = e^{i\\omega 0} = 1 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) = (e^{i\\omega T})^n \\\\) at t = T be the same as \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\) applied at \\\\( t=0 \\\\) modifies the initial value to \\\\( 1^n = 1 \\\\). Hence, the evolution \\\\( (e^{i\\omega T})^n \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) correctly equals \\\\( e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\), matching the behavior of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega nt} \\\\) from the transformation property.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
