  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) by knowing its Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi)\\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Fourier transform that results in a delta function at \\\\(\\\\xi = \\\\omega\\\\), we can uniquely recover \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) as it is the only function that corresponds to such a specific result in the Fourier domain. The transform provides complete information to reconstruct the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
