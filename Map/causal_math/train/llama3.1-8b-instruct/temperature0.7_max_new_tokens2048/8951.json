  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. An intervention is applied via a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(t)\\\\), with h(t) representing a controlled input function.\n\nIf \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is adjusted at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) to a new form \\\\(h'(t)\\\\), will the end state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) only depend on the operator L and not on the previous form of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) before \\\\(t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) acts as a new initial condition for subsequent evolution, which has been influenced by the previous form of \\\\(h(t)\\\\). Therefore, the final state at time T is dependent on both the original and adjusted forms of \\\\(h(t)\\\\), along with the effects of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
