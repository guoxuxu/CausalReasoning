  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nIf \\\\(h(X)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(X_0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the stochastic differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\(X(t)\\\\) at time t be identical to if \\\\(X_0\\\\) was directly evolved to time t?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\) modifies the initial state, \\\\(X_0\\\\), by adding a constant k, which shifts the entire path of the process. Since the drift \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and the diffusion \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) coefficients might depend on the state, the shift in initial conditions changes the trajectory of \\\\(X_t\\\\), leading to a different state at time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
