  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analysis is conducted on the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), which transforms the function of time \\\\(u(t)\\\\) into a function of complex variable s.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an operator modification \\\\(M\\\\) is introduced, changing the equation to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Mu\\\\), will the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) at s only depend on L and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new operator \\\\(M\\\\) changes the differential equation governing the evolution of \\\\(u(t)\\\\). This intervention modifies the future states of \\\\(u(t)\\\\), affecting the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\), which now encodes the dynamics introduced by \\\\(M\\\\) in addition to L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
