  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nIf we intervene by applying another transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\log(z) \\\\) mid-way during the integration of \\\\( g(f(z)) \\\\), will the outcome of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = \\\\log(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the integration process, affecting the resultant value of the integral. Each transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) can alter the trajectory and the final outcome of the integral, making it dependent on all applied functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
