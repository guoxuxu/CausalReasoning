  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the differential equations system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z represents a complex variable associated with time t. We analyze the system transformation under the integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i \\\\omega s} ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{-i \\\\omega s} ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be influenced only by the matrix A and not by the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional dynamic to the system, making \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent not just on A, but also on how \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modify the trajectory with possibly opposing exponential terms. This leads to a complex interdependence altering the path to \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
