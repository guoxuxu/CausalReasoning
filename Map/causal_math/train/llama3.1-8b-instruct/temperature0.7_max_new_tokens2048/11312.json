  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( \\\\tilde{F}(s) \\\\) after an intervention, can we determine precisely whether the original function was \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) or the intervention function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(a+c)t} \\\\) based solely on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\tilde{F}(s) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( s = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By comparing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\tilde{F}(s) \\\\), one can determine the shift in the pole which directly indicates the intervention. If \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) shifts to \\\\( \\\\tilde{F}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+c)} \\\\), the alteration through \\\\( c \\\\) can be identified, thus distinguishing the original function from the intervened function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
