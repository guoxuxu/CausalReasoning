  "Problem": "Consider a space of functions transformed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), where an input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is converted into its Laplacian \\\\(F(s)\\\\). Examining how modifying functions with the multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) affects inference and predictive capabilities in this transformed domain.\n\nKnowing only the final Laplace Transform \\\\(F(s-(a+b))\\\\), is it possible to distinguish whether the transformation occurred by a single application of \\\\(e^{(a+b)t}f(t)\\\\) or by sequential applications of \\\\(e^{at}f(t)\\\\) followed by \\\\(e^{bt}(e^{at}f(t))\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both a singular transformation using \\\\(e^{(a+b)t}\\\\) and a sequential application of individual exponential factors resulting in the same accumulated effect would yield identical shifts in the Laplace Transform, making it impossible to definitively distinguish the method of application from the outcome alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
