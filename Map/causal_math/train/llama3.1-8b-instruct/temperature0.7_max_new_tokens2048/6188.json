  "Problem": "Consider a system where a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where A is a constant complex number. The function influences the trajectory over time t.\n\nCan one definitely determine what interventions were applied (either \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) based solely on the outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\(z(T)\\\\), multiple combinations of transformations with varying parameters \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) could yield the same final state due to their complex interdependent effects. Thus, it is impractical to uniquely determine the interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
