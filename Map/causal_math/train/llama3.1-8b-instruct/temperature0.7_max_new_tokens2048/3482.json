  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nHaving computed \\\\( F(ax + b) \\\\) at x = T, can we determine the original x value at T, assuming no additional information about a or b?",
  "Explanation": "Without the constants a and b from the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the original x that yields a particular transformed value \\\\( ax + b \\\\). Multiple x values could correspond to the same transformed result due to different potential values of a and b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
