  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We then apply a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, to the function at time t.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a complex constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the end function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on A, ignoring the influences of B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity. The final function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the interactions between A, B, and C. Both intervening transformations influence the system dynamically, thus affecting the outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
