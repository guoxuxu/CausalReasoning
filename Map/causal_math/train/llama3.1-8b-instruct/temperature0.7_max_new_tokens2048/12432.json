  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(g(x)) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) initially, and then allowed to evolve naturally (without further transformation), will the spectral characteristics (frequency components and their amplitudes) at some later time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\), thus altering the spectral characteristics of the function from the outset. As these coefficients define the amplitude and phases of the frequency components in the Fourier series, the transformed function will inherently possess different spectral properties compared to the original unmodified function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
