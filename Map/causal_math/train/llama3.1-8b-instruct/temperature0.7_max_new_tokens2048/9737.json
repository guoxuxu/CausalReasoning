  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the ordinary differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix representing the system dynamics, and C represents the control input effect. The focus is on examining system behavior with and without the forced input transformation given by function \\\\( h(u) = e^{Fu}u \\\\), where F is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a constant control input \\\\( u \\\\) is applied without the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\), and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equal to when \\\\( u \\\\) is transformed with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\) fundamentally changes the control input, leading to a different initial condition and system trajectory. The existence of the exponential function \\\\( e^{Fu} \\\\) in the control input alters how the system responds over time, leading to a distinct state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
