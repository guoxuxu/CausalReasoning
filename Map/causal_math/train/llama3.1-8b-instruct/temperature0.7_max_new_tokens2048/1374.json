  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate how the application of a convolution transformation defined by kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with its Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the convolution \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast h)(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) separately without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The product form \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\) alone does not allow for the unique decomposition into \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) unless further information about one of the functions is known. Multiple function pairs can yield the same product, leading to intrinsic ambiguity in inferring the original functions solely based on their product.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
