  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\\\lambda u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the state of the system at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) which converts the spatial component to the frequency domain.\n\nAfter observing the transformed state \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we deduce the initial transformed state \\\\( F(u)(k, 0) \\\\) without knowing the form of the original spatial domain function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and invertible nature of both the Fourier transform and the temporal evolution dictated by the partial differential equation, one can uniquely reverse the temporal evolution in the frequency domain and apply the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). The process is deterministic and reversible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
