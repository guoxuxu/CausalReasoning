  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified by a transformation using a Laplace transform with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at some time t, can we determine uniquely what the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) because different \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) pairs can produce the same output due to properties of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
