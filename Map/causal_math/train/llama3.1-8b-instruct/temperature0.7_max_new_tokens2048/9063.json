  "Problem": "We analyze a heat equation \\(\\partial u/\\partial t = \\alpha \\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\) for a rod initially subject to a temperature distribution \\(u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\) with \\(\\alpha > 0\\). Let's evaluate the effects of applying a Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) which flips the sine component.\n\nIf the Fourier sine transform \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) is applied at some middle time \\(t_1\\), will the temperature profile \\(u(x, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) be influenced by this transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{F}_s\\) at \\(t_1\\) alters the temperature profile at that instant, which influences how it evolves subsequently under the heat equation. This intervention changes the state of the system, influencing the outcome at \\(T\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
