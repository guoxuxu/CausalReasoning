  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). The presence of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) as a potential modification at t = 0 means there are multiple compatible initial states for any given distribution at time T, influenced by the different potential amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal term.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
