  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze scenarios where g(t) is a solution to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with initial conditions, and \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, we study the implications of adding transformations like \\\\( g(t) = h(t)g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is known.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for all s, can we uniquely determine the initial condition of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is a solution to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is known and the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) is well-defined, then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) can be uniquely inverted to find \\\\( g(0) \\\\). The transformation from function to Laplace domain and back is unique for linear systems with known parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
