  "Problem": "Examine the causal impacts within a system described by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. The study involves the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) on the function over time.\n\nKnowing only the final transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can the specific type of intervention (the form of matrix \\\\( H \\\\)) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple forms of interventions (different matrices \\\\( H \\\\)) might yield the same transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) \\\\) due to the nature of linear transformations. The specific intervention type from the Laplace transformed function alone remains indeterminable without additional system insight or constraining data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
