  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( j(z) = z^3 \\\\) is introduced at t = T_1 as an intervention. Does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > T_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the earlier applied transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation changes the power to which the exponential is raised, impacting the trajectory profoundly. The final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the sequence of transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), then \\\\( j(z) \\\\)), including their compound effects: \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes either \\\\( e^{3i\\\\omega (T-T_1)} \\\\) multiplied by either \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T_1} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{2i\\\\omega T_1} \\\\).",
