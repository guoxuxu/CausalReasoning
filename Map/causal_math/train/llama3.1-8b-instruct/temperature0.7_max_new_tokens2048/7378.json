  "Problem": "Consider a system is modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t) + ig(t) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. Integral operator \\\\( K \\\\) defined by \\\\( K[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during its evolution.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) assuming no further knowledge except \\\\( K \\\\) and the output at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\) is the cumulative effect of all states from the interval [0, T]. Multiple initial conditions can lead to the same output at time T due to the nature of integral operators smoothing out over time. Without additional constraints or data on the system's evolution, the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
