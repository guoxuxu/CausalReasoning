  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\), and the value of the resistance change \\\\(R'\\\\), can we determine definitively whether the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) and the resistance change \\\\(R'\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine if the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied. The system's linearity and the overlapping effects from varying initial conditions and resistance changes obscure the exact cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
