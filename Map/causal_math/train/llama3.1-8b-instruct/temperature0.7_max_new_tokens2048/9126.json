  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), the transformation effects could disguise the actual initial conditions through modifications in the frequency domain, making it infeasible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) just by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
