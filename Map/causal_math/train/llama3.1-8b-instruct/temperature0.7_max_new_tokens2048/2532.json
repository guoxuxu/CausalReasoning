  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nGiven the signal output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (original, h(t), or both) were applied only by considering the outcome at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed signal \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) could result from multiple possible combinations of original signals and interventions due to the convolution-like integration process. The information regarding specific interventions used loses clarity due to the overlap of effects inherent in the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
