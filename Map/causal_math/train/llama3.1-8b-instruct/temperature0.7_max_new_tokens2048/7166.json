  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(x, 0) \\\\) without knowledge of time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform clearly delineates the time-independent component \\\\( e^{ax} \\\\), which is the exponent at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). Thus, knowing the transformed function allows reversing to the initial state \\\\( z(x, 0) = e^{ax} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
