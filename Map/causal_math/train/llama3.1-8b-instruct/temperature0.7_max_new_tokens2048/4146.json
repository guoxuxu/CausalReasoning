  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. We are analyzing the Julia set generated by this function and explore the behavior of points under iterative applications of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nAfter observing a point \\\\( z_n \\\\) in the Julia set at iteration \\\\( n \\\\), can we assume that the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was also in the Julia set?",
  "Explanation": "If any iterate of a point is within the Julia set, its pre-images or preceding points in the iteration sequence must also reside in the Julia set. This follows from the backward invariance of Julia sets in complex dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
