  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) accurately at t = 0 after applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and then obtaining \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing the value of constant a?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the damping factor a, the exponential modification imposed by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be accurately reversed. This loss of information about the attenuation rate precludes a precise reconstruction of the initial function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
