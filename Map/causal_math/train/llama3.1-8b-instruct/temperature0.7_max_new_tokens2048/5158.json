  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are also complex constants.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g \\\\), and due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( w \\\\). Moreover, the transformation \\\\( g \\\\) can map different starting values to the same result under \\\\( f \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
