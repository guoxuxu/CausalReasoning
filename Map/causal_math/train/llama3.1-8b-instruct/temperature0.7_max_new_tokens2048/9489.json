  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A Laplace transform is then applied yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) are set and the system evolves without further input, will the final forms of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) under their respective Laplace transforms be solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final forms of the Laplace transforms \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), which respectively represent \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the s-domain, will depend only on their initial conditions and the constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The Laplace transform of a linear differential equation is determined by the equation's coefficients and the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
