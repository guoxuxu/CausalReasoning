  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time and i is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), which transforms the complex exponential function into a function of a complex variable s.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the resulting function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\) is allowed to determine the behavior over a period T without further modification, will the inverse Laplace transform at time T recover the original function \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective transformation for this class of functions, meaning that applying the Laplace transform and subsequently its inverse will recover the original function \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\), assuming no modifications are done to the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
