  "Problem": "In a control system, an input vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) to produce an output \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\). An additional operator \\\\(M\\\\), a constant matrix, is later used to alter the system's response.\n\nSuppose a transformation \\\\(N\\\\), another constant matrix, is introduced at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention. Will the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\(N\\\\) alters the system’s behavior forward from \\\\(t_1\\\\). Considering that the system was potentially influenced initially by \\\\(M\\\\), the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) will be influenced by all three operators \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), and \\\\(N\\\\), showing dependency beyond just \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
