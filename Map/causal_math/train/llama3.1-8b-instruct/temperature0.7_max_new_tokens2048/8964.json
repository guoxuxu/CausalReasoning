  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical environment where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes a transformation through a linear time-invariant system described by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system's transfer function is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nGiven the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclude definitively which system characteristics (original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) or modified \\\\( H'(s) \\\\)) were acting at any given time before T?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to back-calculate accurately and distinguish every momentary change in the system's characteristics due to the possibility of different characteristic impact overlaps and the convolutional nature of systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
