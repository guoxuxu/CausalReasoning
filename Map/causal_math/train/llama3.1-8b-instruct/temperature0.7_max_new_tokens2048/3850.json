  "Problem": "Examine a scenario where the integral transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), described by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt}f(t) dt \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) describes a physical system's response, and various transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) are studied to understand their influence over system behavior.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) generated by applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), can we infallibly reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without any additional information or assumptions?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming all conditions are ideal, which includes having a function that conforms to the prerequisites of the Laplace transform (such as exponential order and integrability), the inverse Laplace transform can uniquely determine \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( g(x) \\\\), as the transform is inherently an injective operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
