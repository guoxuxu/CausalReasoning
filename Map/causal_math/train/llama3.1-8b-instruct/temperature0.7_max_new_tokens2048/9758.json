  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\( u(x, 0) \\) after observing \\( u(x, t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( F(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was applied, the evolution of \\( u(x, t) \\) under the heat equation is well-defined and reversible for both the original and transformed states. The linearity and reversibility of the heat equation in both the spatial and frequency domains ensure that \\( u(x, 0) \\) can be accurately recovered from \\( u(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
