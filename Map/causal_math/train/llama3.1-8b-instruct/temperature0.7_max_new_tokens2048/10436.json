  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed outcome \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) at some T > t_1, can we precisely determine what interventions were applied (specific values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)) only by knowing \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) and the function type before intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed outcome \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) does not retain enough specific information to uniquely determine the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) of the intervention due to the integration process and the influence of complex dynamics from the original differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
