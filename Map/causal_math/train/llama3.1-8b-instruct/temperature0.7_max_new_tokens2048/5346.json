  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, where the transform of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\). The analysis investigates the effect of manipulating the function before transforming it using a multiplier function \\\\(g(t) = e^{At}t^k\\\\) where A is a real constant and k is an integer.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(G(s)\\\\), can we accurately back-calculate to find \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(g(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the multiplier \\\\(g(t)\\\\) was used, it's impossible to reliably deduce \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(G(s)\\\\) because the transformation induced by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) (if applied) could significantly alter the characteristics of the resulting function in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
