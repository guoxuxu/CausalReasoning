  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\(z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) for a constant matrix A. This function is subjected to various transformations and the responses are observed over the path \\\\(z(t) = z_0 + vt\\\\) where \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant vector and \\\\(t\\\\) represents time.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\(z_0 \\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the system evolves along the path \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any external function applied, is the value of \\\\(f(z(T))\\\\) at some later time \\\\(T\\\\) unaffected by any matrices other than A?",
  "Explanation": "Since no external transformations are applied, the only factors influencing \\\\(f(z(t))\\\\) over time are determined by \\\\(e^{Az(t)}\\\\), which depends solely on A and the path. The matrix A defines the entire transformation over time, with no contribution from any other matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
