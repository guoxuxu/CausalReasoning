  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = cos(x) + i sin(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let us examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( z(x) t= e^tx \\\\) on this complex function over a time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( e^tx \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were used, only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of exponential growth and linear translation on the complex function, it is not possible to uniquely identify whether the function was subjected only to \\\\( e^tx \\\\), only to \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or to both transformations by just analyzing the endpoint \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\). Both transformations affect the rotation angle in the complex plane, making it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
