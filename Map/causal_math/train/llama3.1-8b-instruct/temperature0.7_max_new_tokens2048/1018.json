  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) represented as a matrix on a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) under the flow given by \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a square matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = L\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\), and we are interested in evaluating how this affects the system dynamics.\n\nAfter observing the vector field at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant vector field at \\\\( t = T \\\\) might be indistinguishable from other potential states due to the initial transformation by \\\\( L \\\\), particularly if the dynamics are complex or if \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\) interact in non-trivial ways rendering backward deduction impractical.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
