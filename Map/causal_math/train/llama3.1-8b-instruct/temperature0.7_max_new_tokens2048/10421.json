  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\,dt\\\\) on this system.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any intervention, and then the inverse transform is used, will the resultant function exactly match the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a function like \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is essentially an exponential function, can be inverted perfectly assuming all conditions for the transform and inverse transform are met. The reconstruction of the original function from its transform is exact in theoretical scenarios.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
