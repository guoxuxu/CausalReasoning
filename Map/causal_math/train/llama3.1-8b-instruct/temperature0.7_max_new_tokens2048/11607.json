  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used to analyze its frequency components.\n\nIf a periodic function \\\\( s(t) = cos(\\\\omega_1 t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 as an intervention, and then \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is calculated, will the resulting spectrum's primary frequency components be solely determined by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a cosine function to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) introduces new frequency components at \\\\( \\\\pm \\\\omega_1 \\\\) which will significantly influence the spectrum. However, the spectrum will also still contain the inherent frequency components of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Thus, the spectrum is a result of both the intervention in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the original characteristics of \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
