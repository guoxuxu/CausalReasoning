  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time following the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. Further, investigate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) at any given time t, where N is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\) by applying the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\), which alters the trajectory of the system's evolution. Unless N and M commute in a specific way, the outcome at time T will generally differ when starting from the transformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
