  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. The system is analyzed using a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another scalar constant.\n\nIf at some point, say \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (D being a scalar constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, be dependent solely on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation affecting both amplitude and phase of z. Thus, the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by A, B, C from the initial transformation, and D from the intervention, making it a product of multiple influences rather than only A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
