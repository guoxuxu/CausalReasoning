  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition. We look into the effects of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse affect the function over time t.\n\nAfter observing the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without extra information?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform and its inverse are unique under standard conditions, observing the state at any time t = T after applying the inverse Laplace allows us to compute back uniquely to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "applying Laplace transform → obtaining Z(s); applying inverse Laplace transform → obtaining z(t); observing z(t) at t = T → obtaining z(T); z(T) → z_0 if T = 0"
