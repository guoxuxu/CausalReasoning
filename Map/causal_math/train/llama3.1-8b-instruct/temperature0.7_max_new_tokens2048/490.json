  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. We examine the system's behavior under the influence of a linear operator \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\), where S is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the system at \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we precisely deduce the initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the operator \\\\(h(z)\\\\) has been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is essential as the transformation \\\\(Sz_0\\\\) may have modified the initial conditions in ways that cannot be reversed accurately to ascertain \\\\(z_0\\\\), especially if S does not have a straightforward inverse or does not commute with M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
