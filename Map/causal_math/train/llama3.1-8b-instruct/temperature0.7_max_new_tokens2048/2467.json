  "Problem": "Consider a periodic signal described by the function \\\\( v(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi) \\\\). The signal undergoes various modifications using a linear operator represented by \\\\( L \\\\) that performs a convolution with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically designed to alter phase and amplitude.\n\nIf an additional linear operation \\\\( M \\\\) with another kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied at a later time t = t_1, does the signal \\\\( u(t) = M[w(t)] \\\\) at t = T depend only on the operation \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervened signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T depends both on the earlier applied \\\\( L \\\\) as well as the later applied \\\\( M \\\\). The effects of the kernels \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are both influential, affecting the resultant signal through combined interactions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
