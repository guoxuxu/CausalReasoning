  "Problem": "The scenario involves the eigenvalue problem in the evolution of a system under transformation. Given a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix, we examine its effects on the dynamics modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the precise interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) be determined based only on the end state?",
  "Explanation": "The nonlinear and complex nature of the exponential transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) makes it impossible to unequivocally determine which interventions were applied based only on the final state. The potential for these transformations to overlap in effects and influence the trajectory in undistinguishable ways makes such a determination infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
