  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\) applied at different instances.\n\nIf a Laplace transformation \\\\( L[z] \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the initiation without any further change in the system, will the Laplace transform reflect solely the linear dynamics described by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, being a linear operator, will directly translate the linear dynamics of \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) into the Laplace domain, preserving the dynamics dictated by the matrices A and B without any alteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
