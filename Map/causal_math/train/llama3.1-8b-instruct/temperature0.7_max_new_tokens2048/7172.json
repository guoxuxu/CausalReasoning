  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) with variable \\\\(t\\\\) representing time. We study the effects of a transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) and explore causal relationships and interventions in the temporal evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we ascertain precisely what intervention was used (whether \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) or none), purely based on the knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduced by \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) can lead to ambiguity in backward inference. Multiple paths (with or without intervention) could lead to similar or identical states at \\\\(T\\\\), especially considering that both non-transformed and transformed states can yield similar magnitudes and phase shifts at different times, due to the periodic nature of \\\\(e^{it}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
