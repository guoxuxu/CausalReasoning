  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at T, without knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) fundamentally changes the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating its past states with a complex exponential weighting. Without knowing that \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to unambiguously trace back to the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
