  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then this state is allowed to evolve under the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be identical to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time T under the initial function alone?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially changes the starting condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. The subsequent evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) starts from this transformed state, leading to \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT} (e^{iBT} z_0) \\\\), which is generally different from \\\\( e^{iAT} z_0 \\\\) unless A equals B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
