  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined over time, where the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time t is influenced by \\\\(z_0\\\\) and a transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) a real constant. We investigate the role of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Bz\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it feasible to precisely determine which interventions (either \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied at any point between t = 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential non-commutativity between the matrices involved (\\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\)), and their influence on the evolution, it is impossible to unequivocally deduce the specific interventions based solely on the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Different combinations of interventions could lead to identical or indistinguishable outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
