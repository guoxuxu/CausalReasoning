  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where an electrical circuit is represented by a system of linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a matrix describing the dynamics of the circuit. The response of this circuit to external stimuli is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M is a matrix and N is a vector.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( j(x) = Qx + R \\\\) (where Q is a matrix and R is a vector) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M, N, Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( j(x) \\\\) additionally complicates the system's state evolution, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial transformation M, N and the later intervention Q, R. Each can shift and scale the trajectory differently, hence their contributions cannot be ignored.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
