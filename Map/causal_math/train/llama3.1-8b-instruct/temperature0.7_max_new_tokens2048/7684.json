  "Problem": "Let's consider two complex functions \\( f(z) = e^z \\) and \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) applied to a complex variable \\( z \\). The behavior of these functions under the Laplace transform is studied, where the transformation is denoted \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\) and applied as an intervention.\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\) after interventions, can we ascertain exactly which functions were applied (be it \\( f(z), g(z) \\), or both) merely by analyzing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequence or types of function applications can lead to the same endpoint under the Laplace transform due to properties like linearity and overlap in transformation outputs. Determining specifically whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both were used can't be uniquely resolved just by inspecting \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
