  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) for \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) without further application of \\\\( f \\\\), will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is simply the zero vector (due to the integral of zero), the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remains unaltered. Therefore, it follows the prescribed exponential map \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\), resulting in the same state at any \\\\( t = T \\\\) as if the transformation was never applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
