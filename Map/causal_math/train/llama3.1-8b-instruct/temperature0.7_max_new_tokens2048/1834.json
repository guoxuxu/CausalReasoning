  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\) that changes u from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.\n\nCan the original spatial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be recovered exactly from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at some T > 0 after being evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), without knowledge of whether a Fourier transformation was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Fourier transformation was applied, predicting whether the system has evolved in the spatial or frequency domain is uncertain. The recovery of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) demands precise knowledge about the initial conditions and transformations, which is not provided here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
