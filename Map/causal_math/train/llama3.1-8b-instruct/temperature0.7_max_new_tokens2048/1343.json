  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nIf a differential operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), does the resulting Fourier Transform solely depend on \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) or does the effect of multiplication by x still influence the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The additional differential operation will produce a complex modification of the Fourier Transform. While \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) would guide the final outcome, the initial multiplication by x and subsequent differentiation would significantly alter the resulting Fourier spectrum, maintaining the influence of both operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
