  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) and A is a complex matrix. The function undergoes a Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{iAx}\\\\}(s) \\\\. Furthermore, an intervention by a matrix operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied intermittently, transforming \\\\( z(x) \\\\) into \\\\( Mz(x) \\).\n\nCan the original function form \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) be uniquely identified just from the result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Under no intervention, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) which results from \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) reflects the characteristics of the matrix A uniquely due to the direct one-to-one correspondence in the transformation process specified by the Laplace Transform of exponential functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
