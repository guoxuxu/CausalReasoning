  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nCan we ascertain the exponent k from observing the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T, knowing it underwent a transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at x_0?",
  "Explanation": "If we can measure the rate of rotation and compare it to the expected rate from \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\), we can infer the value of k as it affects the frequency of oscillation in the complex exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
