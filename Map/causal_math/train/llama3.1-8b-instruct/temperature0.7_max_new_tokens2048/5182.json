  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{wt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Study the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, and T is the upper limit of integration.\n\nGiven the result from the transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\), can one deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 assuming no information about the evolution dynamics except the result of \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( G(z) \\\\) consolidates information about the function over an interval, it does not enable precise reconstruction of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) or the exact parameters of \\\\( w \\\\) without prior knowledge of the function's form or the parameter \\\\( s \\\\). The integral aggregates influence over time, blending effects across the interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
