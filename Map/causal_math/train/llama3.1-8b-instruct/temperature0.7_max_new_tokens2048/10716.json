  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and \\( z \\) is subjected to the integral transformation \\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex variable \\( s \\). Analyze the effects of modifying \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) separately on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( Z(s) \\), can we precisely determine whether the changes were applied to \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\), especially if we do not know the nature of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( Z(s) \\) is a composite function capturing the integrated effects of both \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), without knowledge of the specific form or timing of interventions, it is impossible to accurately attribute observed changes in \\( Z(s) \\) to alterations in \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) independently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
