  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We are interested in understanding how the integral transforms, specifically the Laplace transform, affect this function and its causal inference.\n\nGiven a Laplace transform that corresponds to \\\\( g(z) = f(z) + cos(z) \\\\), can we precisely deduce the form of the original interventions (\\\\( e^{z} \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\)) from this transform alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace transforms for \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\) are unique and known, and assuming the linearity and the properties of the Laplace transform, we can deconstruct the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) back to the individual transforms of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\). However, this assumes no overlap in the properties of the transforms or additional complexities such as multi-valuedness or similar issues.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
