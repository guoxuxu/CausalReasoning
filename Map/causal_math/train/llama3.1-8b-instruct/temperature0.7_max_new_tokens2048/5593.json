  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a system in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\), with real matrices P and Q. Examine the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{(C + iD)t}z \\\\), where C and D are also real matrices.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T under the original system without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by an exponential factor \\\\( e^{(C + iD)t} \\\\). This factor changes both amplitude and phase components in the complex vector, resulting in a state at time T that differs from simple evolution under \\\\( (P + iQ)z \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
