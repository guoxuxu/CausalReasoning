  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nIf an additional damping term, introduced at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affects the solution, will the Fourier transform of the solution at \\\\( t = T \\\\) still correspond to the evolution described by the initial PDE without the damping term?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping term (e.g., \\\\( -\\\\gamma u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a damping coefficient) modifies the dynamics of the fluid flow. As a result, the Fourier transform of the final state will incorporate effects of this damping, deviating from the original undamped evolved state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
