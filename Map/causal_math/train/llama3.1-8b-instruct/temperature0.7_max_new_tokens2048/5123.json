  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, on a field defined by \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) over the complex plane. The function transforms the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) over time, under linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{mz} \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time T a function not only of \\\\( A \\\\) but also significantly influenced by both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\). The impact of the complex exponential transformations due to \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\) would profoundly alter the development and outcome in the complex field.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
