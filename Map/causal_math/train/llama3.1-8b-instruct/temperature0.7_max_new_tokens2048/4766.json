  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the result of combined transformations of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the order of transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The combined effect of convolution and Fourier transformation can produce similar outcomes from different initial conditions and transformation orders. Without knowledge of the order, the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved because both transformations potentially alter the function's fundamental characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
