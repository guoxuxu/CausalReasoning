  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant related to eigenvalues. The solution space is transformed via the Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). The impact of computation methods such as numerical integration is also explored.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) purely from knowledge of the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some t > 0, without knowing whether a Fourier Transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion from a later state \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t > 0 to the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) inherently requires knowledge of all transformations applied, including the Fourier Transform. The transformations might encode phase or other changes that aren't directly observable in \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
