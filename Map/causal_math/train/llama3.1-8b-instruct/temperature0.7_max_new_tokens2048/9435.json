  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation defined by another integral transform \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\lambda t} z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on matrix \\\\( D \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) modifies the function in another domain, potentially altering the subsequent dynamics as observed through Fourier transform. The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both transformations, and thus, the Fourier transform reflects changes due to both \\\\( D \\\\) and the effects introduced by \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
