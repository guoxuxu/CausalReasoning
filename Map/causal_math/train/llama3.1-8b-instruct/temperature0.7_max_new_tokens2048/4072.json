  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( w_0 \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time. This function is subject to transformations by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed function at time T, is it possible to precisely infer whether the transformation was effected solely by \\\\( L \\\\), solely by \\\\( M \\\\), or by a combination of the two, merely from the function form at T?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed at time T could correspond to the application of \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both, as transformations might integrate in a non-distinctive way. The information provided by the observed outcome at T lacks specificity, potentially masking critical details about the type or sequence of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
