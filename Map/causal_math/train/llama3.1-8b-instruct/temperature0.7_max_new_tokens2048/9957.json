  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\\\lambda u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the state of the system at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) which converts the spatial component to the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the given partial differential equation without further intervention, will the Fourier transformation of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to the solution obtained by directly evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) under the equation and then applying \\\\( F(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the Fourier transform initially and evolving the system under the differential equation, the transformation of the differential equation into the frequency domain simplifies to \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = -\\\\lambda - k^2 \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which evolves identically as the spatial counterpart because the Fourier transform of the Laplacian is a multiplication in the frequency domain \\\\( -k^2 \\\\). Thus, the end result remains consistent.",
