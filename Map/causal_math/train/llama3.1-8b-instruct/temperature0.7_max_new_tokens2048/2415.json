  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t, z) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. We study the impact of an intervention defined by the transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = t^k z \\\\) where k is a real constant.\n\nIf at certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = t^h z \\\\) (where h is a different real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a particular s depend only on the original transformation and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new power \\\\( h \\\\) alters the moment of the function \\\\( t^h z \\\\) incorporated into the integral transformation, making the final state \\\\( g(z) \\\\) dependent not only on the original power k but also on the new power h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
