  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is an input signal and \\\\(s\\\\) the complex frequency variable. The system can be studied with an input modification where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(y) = y(t-a) \\\\), for some delay constant \\\\(a\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(y) \\\\) is applied, shifting \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to \\\\( y(t-a) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is evolved by its natural properties under the Laplace transform, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) only be shifted in the s-plane?",
  "Explanation": "When a time-domain function such as \\\\( y(t-a) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform, the resulting transform is \\\\( Y(s)e^{-as} \\\\). This transformation represents a shift in the frequency domain s-plane, consistent with the time delay introduced by \\\\( f(y) \\\\). Thus, the effect is a direct shift without altering the functional form of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) being modified by a multiplicative exponential decay factor depending on \\\\(a\\\\).",
