  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), strictly from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of transformations with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) due to the complex exponential nature of the transformations, which affects both amplitude and phase. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to uniquely identify which transformations were made.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
