  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(t) =  ∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given function. We study how changes in \\\\( h(s) \\\\) influence the graph of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given that \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( h''(s) = dh(s) \\\\), where \\\\( d \\\\) is a non-zero constant, is applied, will \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t=T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be proportionally scaled by \\\\( d \\\\) from \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h''(s) = dh(s) \\\\) when applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), scales the integrand and hence \\\\( z''(t) = d∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds = d z(t) \\\\) for all \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\). This affects the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) which becomes proportionally scaled by the factor \\\\( d \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
