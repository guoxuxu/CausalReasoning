  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We assess the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a real constant, and investigate how it influences the behavior over time t.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( f(t) = e^{iCt} \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), solely depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( f(t) \\\\) introduces an additional modification, making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\), and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) superimpose their effects on the trajectory of the system, influencing the complex number’s evolution and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
