  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate what happens when a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied on the initial temperature distribution, and later an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is used.\n\nIf the final temperature distribution at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) is known, and an intervention was performed at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine exactly what the intervention was (specifically, was it a Fourier or a Laplace transform or both) by just observing the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature of the intervention strictly from the final state is not feasible, as different transformations could yield equivalent results due to the properties of linear operators and the potential overlap of transform effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
