  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a signal at time t. Assume that a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformed function is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](\\\\omega) \\\\), which offers a frequency domain representation of the signal.\n\nIf at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), a filter (represented by operator \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting output in the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\Omega(\\\\omega) \\\\) for any \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be independent of the original transformation applied by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The applied filter \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) will interact with the transformed representation \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at that specific frequency, thereby affecting the outcome dependent on both the original transformation and the nature of the filter. The final representation \\\\( \\\\Omega(\\\\omega) \\\\) is therefore influenced by the initial Fourier transformation as well as the filter's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
