  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where L is a linear operator and z_0 is an initial complex number. We explore the behavior involving an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Kt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where K is another linear operator.\n\nHaving obtained the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), is it possible to recover the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) knowing only the operator L and assuming no prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about K (used in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)), it is impossible to revert the integral transform because the integral operation and the exponential factor due to K mask or alter the original dynamics represented solely by L. Properties lost or merged during transformation cannot be uniquely recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
