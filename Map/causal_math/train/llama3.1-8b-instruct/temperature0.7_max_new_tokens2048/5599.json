  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint \\\\( T \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new scope of integral transformation starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), affecting the trajectory and final expression of \\\\( z \\\\) by adding influences unique to the interaction between \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the evolving function. This makes \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the original dynamics and the new transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
