  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution condition.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention is applied that inversely transforms \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) the temperature distribution at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), then allows it to evolve to time T, will the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) be affected only by the initial use of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and not by the inverse transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) effectively modifies the state once more, potentially reversing the earlier spectral changes made by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). This interaction means the final state depends on the nature and timing of both transformations and their interplay with the heat equation dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
