  "Problem": "Let's consider the vector space transformation by the integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), known as the Laplace Transform. We study the behavior when the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, transforms under this operation.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\( T[f+g](s) \\\\) after applying the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we determine which function or matrix (either \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)) was applied first?",
  "Explanation": "Given the superposition principle and linearity of the Laplace Transform, the transformed result \\\\( T[f+g](s) \\\\) does not provide information about the order of application of the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Both contribute to the final state without indicating the sequential order of their application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
