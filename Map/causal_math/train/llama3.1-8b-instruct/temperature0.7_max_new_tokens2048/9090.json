  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^{zt} dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the implication of perturbing the variable \\\\( z \\\\) through a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z + w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( z \\\\) input without knowing whether \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of exponential and integral transforms in complex analysis, multiple values could yield the same or indistinguishable results, especially without knowing the application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\). The nonlinear transformation further complicates backward tracing of the input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
