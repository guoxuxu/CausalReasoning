  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before taking its Fourier transform, is the output primarily influenced by the new transformation and not just by \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) modifies \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{az^2} \\\\), significantly altering its behavior. The Fourier transform of this new function, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{e^{az^2}\\\\}(k) \\\\), substantially depends on this quadratic transformation, showcasing effects like broadening that are distinct from those caused by \\\\( a \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
