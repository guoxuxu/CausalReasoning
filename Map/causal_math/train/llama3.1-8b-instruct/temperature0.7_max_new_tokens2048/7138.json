  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\). We explore the behavior of this transformation under different conditions and study the causal inference between the input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and its transformed counterpart \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is zero for all s, can we conclude that \\\\(f(t)\\\\) was zero for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform being zero implies that the integral of \\\\(e^{-st}f(t)\\\\) is zero for all s, which necessarily means that \\\\(f(t)\\\\) must be identically zero. This follows from the uniquess of the Laplace transform, where different functions cannot have the same transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
