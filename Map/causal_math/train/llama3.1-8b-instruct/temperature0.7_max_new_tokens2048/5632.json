  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) in the context of a mapping from the complex plane to itself. We explore the effect of computing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) \\\\) of this function, where the Fourier transform is defined in the integral form as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-2\\\\pi i z \\\\xi} dz \\\\).\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[g(f(z))](\\\\xi) \\\\), can one determine distinctly whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied before \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was the only function used, without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the compounded function \\\\( e^{(1-a)z} \\\\) may resemble the transform of other exponential functions if \\\\( a \\\\) approximates specific values. Without knowing \\\\( a \\\\) or the sequence of operations clearly, it's impossible to deduce the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
