  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario involving integral transformations. Let \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be a holomorphic function in a region \\\\( R \\\\). We examine the effect of transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_C K(z, s) f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\) is a kernel function also holomorphic in some domain of \\\\( R \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point another transformation \\\\( U \\\\), defined by \\\\( U[f](z) = \\\\int_D M(z, t) f(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another contour and \\\\( M \\\\) a different kernel), is applied to \\\\( f \\\\) after \\\\( T \\\\), will the endpoint function \\\\( h(z) = U[T[f]](z) \\\\) be solely determined by the properties of \\\\( f \\\\) and not the characteristics of \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compositional nature of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) means the final function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) depends critically not only on \\\\( f \\\\) but also the properties and interaction of both kernels \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\). The successive transformations can create complex relationships that are dependent on the details of both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
