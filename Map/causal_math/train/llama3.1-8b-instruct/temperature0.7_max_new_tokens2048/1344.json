  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nFrom observing the resulting spectrum after interventions (multiplication by x and differentiation), can we unambiguously define the sequence or type of operations (whether multiplication by x or differentiation, or both) performed on \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations applied (both multiplication and differentiation) would alter the spectrum in a way that complexity increases, making it difficult to discern the detailed sequence of operations from the final Fourier Transform, owing to intrinsic interdependencies and potential overlap of transformation effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
