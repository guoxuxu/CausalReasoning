  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) each satisfy the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y \\\\) with different parameters \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). We explore using a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its impact on interpreting frequency components.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\), is applied at time zero to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\) still be recognizable in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) after transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but does not eliminate the characteristic frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). Instead, the Fourier transform will show broadened peaks (not delta functions anymore) centered at these frequencies. The damping introduces exponential decay, affecting the sharpness but not the location of the frequency peaks.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
