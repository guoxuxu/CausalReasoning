  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{B(x-s)}u(s)ds \\) on the solution \\( u(x,t) \\), where B is another constant coefficient.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( S(u) = \\int_x^\\infty e^{C(s-x)}u(s)ds \\) (where C is a constant coefficient) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\( u(x,T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\( S(u) \\) introduces another alteration of the system's state based on another convolution, making the final state \\( u(x,T) \\) dependent on A, B, and C. These transformations can superpose and interfere, significantly affecting the trajectory and final state of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
