  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we study the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{t^{2}} dt \\\\) over a complex variable z, with w being another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) evaluates the transformed input without further manipulation, will the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) directly affects the input of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), thereby altering the integration path and limits in the complex plane. This change generally leads to a different value of the integral, since \\\\( e^{wz} \\\\) could exponentially manipulate the growth of the integrand based on the value of w and z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "w → z_0; z_0 → h(z_0); h(z_0) → f(z); z → f(z); z → e^{t^{2}}; z → h(z); e^{wz_0} → f(z)"
