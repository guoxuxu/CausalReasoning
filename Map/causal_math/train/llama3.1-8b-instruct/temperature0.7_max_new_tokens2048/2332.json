  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) defined on complex numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( f \\) being a holomorphic function. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) concerning variable \\( y \\) and the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\) concerning variable \\( x \\) are used to analyze transformed functions.\n\nKnowing the final transformed state after applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), is it possible to determine whether the intervention \\( g(x, y) \\) was applied without additional context on transformation procedure or \\( g \\)'s properties?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of the specific intervention \\( g(x, y) \\) used is infeasible without more information, as different interventions could result in equivalent effects on the transformed function due to overlapping influence in the transforms' domains. This non-uniqueness in the inverse problem makes accurate identification challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
