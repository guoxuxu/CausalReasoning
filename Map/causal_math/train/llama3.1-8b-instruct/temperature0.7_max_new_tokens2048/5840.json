  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\). We explore the impact of transforming the variable \\\\(u\\\\) using a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), solely based on the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The nonlinear behavior of the differential equation combined with different potential transformations applied (addition and subtraction by \\\\( k \\\\)) means multiple potential pathways could result in the same endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the sequence or types of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
