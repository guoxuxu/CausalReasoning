  "Problem": "In a controlled environment, the complex function \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) is implemented in a system, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a time-parameterized linear function given by \\\\( w = at + bi \\\\), with constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The system's output \\\\( z \\\\) is analyzed before and after the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a fixed time.\n\nFrom observing the integral output \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), can the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) be uniquely identified without additionally knowing the function form \\\\( z(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) is influenced by both the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) as well as the structural form of \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\). Without knowing the form and behavior of \\\\( z \\\\), multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) could potentially yield similar outputs, hence making their unique identification problematic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
