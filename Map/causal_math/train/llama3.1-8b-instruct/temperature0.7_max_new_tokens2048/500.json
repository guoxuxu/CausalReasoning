  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is a solution, then we apply a transformation by adding a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) where \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) and examine changes in the boundary behavior.\n\nGiven the boundary conditions of \\\\(u\\\\) at a time t = T, can the parameters k and the exact form of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of k and different forms of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) could result in the same boundary behavior at t = T, especially considering the complex interactions and the infinite possibilities for the choice of \\\\(g\\\\). Therefore, it is impossible to uniquely determine k and \\\\(g\\\\) simply based on the observed boundary conditions at time T.",
