  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the initial value problem defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0 \\\\) with initial conditions. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to simplify this differential equation to a form involving complex functions.\n\nGiven the final transformed state of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) after sequential Laplace and Fourier Transforms, can we confidently deduce the exact sequence of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final state may not uniquely correspond to a specific sequence of transformations due to the potential for overlapping effects and the general properties of integral transforms. Different sequences of operations could conceivably yield equivalent final states, making exact deduction impractical without further context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
