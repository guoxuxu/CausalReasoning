  "Problem": "Consider a function described by a complex form \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the complex variable z, respectively. Let \\\\( u(t) = e^{-t}cos(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t}sin(t) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied defined as \\\\( T(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with a complex parameter s.\n\nCan we determine whether an intervention changing s occurred based only on observing the transformed function output at \\\\( T_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sets of transitions in s value can result in the same or very similar outputs by the time \\\\( T_2 \\\\) due to overlapping effects in the decay and frequency transformations. Identifying a specific intervention or set of interventions exclusively from the result is consequently intricate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
