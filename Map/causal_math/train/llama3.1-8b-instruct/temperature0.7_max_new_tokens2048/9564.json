  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can we precisely determine which function was applied (either \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\)) just from the result at T after applying the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) could result in similar outcomes for different frequency parameters (\\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)), especially if they resonate or align in certain integral multiples. Without additional information about the phase or other distinct characteristics of the system's response, precise determination of the original function from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alone is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
