  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We investigate the effect of the inverse transformation given by multiplying the transform by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intermediate transformation induces a shift by \\\\( b \\\\) in the s-domain before applying the \\\\( s^2 \\\\) multiplication and inverse transformation, will the final time-domain function still reveal information about the original constant \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even after the shift by \\\\( b \\\\) and subsequent transformation, the source information about \\\\( a \\\\) remains encoded in the exponentials and overall formula structure. The final function will involve terms that reflect the influence of both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), albeit in a more complex relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → Laplace transform; s^2 multiplication → shift; shift by b → change in s-domain; change in s-domain → change in time-domain; change in time-domain → loss of information about a"
