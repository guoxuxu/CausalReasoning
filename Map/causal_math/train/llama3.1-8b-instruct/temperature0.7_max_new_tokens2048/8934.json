  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) as \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the specific transformation parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\( G(s) = F(s-a) \\\\), it’s impossible to uniquely determine both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) without additional information. The translation property in the s-domain does not allow for the recovery of \\\\( a \\\\) or the specific form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) independently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
