  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can the presence of external interventions introducing new frequency components be inferred?",
  "Explanation": "If new or unexpected frequency components are present in the Fourier Transform that are not accounted for by the known natural behavior of the system, it suggests the presence of external interventions or modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
