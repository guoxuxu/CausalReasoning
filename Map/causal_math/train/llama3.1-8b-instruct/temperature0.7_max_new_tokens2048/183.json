  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) describes an input function to the system. We examine the impact of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(x) = Fe^{Gt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) are constant matrices) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by A and not influenced by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) = Fe^{Gt}x \\\\) introduces an additional variable into the scenario, which modifies the input function further. Therefore, the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is dependent on \\\\( A, C, D, F, \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), due to the combination and interaction of these transformations through the integral equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
