  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed function at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without knowing the coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\) used in the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( a_n \\\\) from the modified coefficients \\( b_n a_n \\). Multiple different initial functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) could result in the same observed output under different sets of \\\\( b_n \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation → Coefficients b_n; Coefficients b_n → Modified coefficients a_n; Modified coefficients a_n → Fourier series g(x); Observation at time t → Fourier-transformed function; Fourier-transformed function → Original function g(x)"
