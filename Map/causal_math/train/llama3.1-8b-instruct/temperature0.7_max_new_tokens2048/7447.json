  "Problem": "We consider an electrical system modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), representing the impedance as a function of complex frequency \\\\( s \\\\). An intervention is applied by modifying the system impedance through an additional component described as \\\\( H(s) = e^{-st}Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied midway, introducing a new impedance model \\\\( K(s) = e^{-sut}Z(s) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is a real constant, does the final system’s response depend only on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( t \\\\) or \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new model \\\\( K(s) \\\\) introduces another exponential factor which changes the overall impedance of the system again. Thus, the final impedance characteristics at any \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\) are influenced not only by Z(s) but also significantly by both factors \\\\( t \\\\) and \\\\( u \\\\) from intervening terms \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-sut} \\\\), impacting the system's response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
