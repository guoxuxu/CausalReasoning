  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) is Fourier transformed without any modifications, will the resulting function \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) yields a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), implying a peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\). This demonstrates that the original frequency \\(\\omega\\) dominantly characterizes the transformed function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
