  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where x(t) and y(t) follow the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By(t) \\\\) respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. We examine the effect of applying the Laplace transform on these functions, denoted as \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the combined function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some point s, can we uniquely determine x(0) and y(0) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\\\) provides combined information of x and y in the frequency domain. Without additional phase or separation criteria, determining individual x(0) and y(0) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
