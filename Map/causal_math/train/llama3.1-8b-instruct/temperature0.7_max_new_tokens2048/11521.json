  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. We examine the effect of applying the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this function over the variable 's', a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is computed for a given function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be solely dependent on the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without external influences?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is a linear operator that directly depends on the form and characteristics of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Outside interventions or changes to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself do not occur in this process, making \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) solely dependent on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
