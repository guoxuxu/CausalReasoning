  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nGiven the form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T, can the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be deduced by observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the independent nature of the progression of \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) from the complex oscillatory behavior of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), observing the quadratic progression of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) provides no information about the initial or any other state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
