  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a series of transformations including a Fourier Transform followed by a linear filter represented by a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then an inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nCan one determine whether the non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) was applied by analyzing the final signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if the effects of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) are known?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether \\\\( D(t) \\\\) was applied from the final signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is challenging without additional information. The non-linear transformation effects can mimic or overshadow characteristics that might otherwise indicate the function of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), leading to potential ambiguity in identifying the presence of \\\\( D(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
