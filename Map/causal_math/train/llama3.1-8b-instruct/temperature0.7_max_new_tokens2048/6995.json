  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) that transforms a function \\( u(x) \\) using a convolution integral \\( L[u](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x - t)u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( k \\) is the kernel function. We scrutinize the effects of an initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) and its interaction with different kernels, including potential changes in kernel midway.\n\nIf we alter the kernel function to \\( k_2(x) \\) at an intermediate time \\( t_1 \\), replacing \\( k_1(x) \\), will the final output \\( L[u_0](x) \\) solely depend on the later applied kernel \\( k_2(x) \\) while disregarding the initial effects of \\( k_1(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of \\( k_1(x) \\) on \\( u_0(x) \\) prior to changing to \\( k_2(x) \\) can still persist and influence the system's behavior alongside the new effects introduced by \\( k_2(x) \\). The final state is a complex superposition or interaction of both kernels on the initial function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
