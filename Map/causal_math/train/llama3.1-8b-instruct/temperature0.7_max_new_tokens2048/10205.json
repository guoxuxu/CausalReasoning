  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\), where \\\\( f(t) \\) is the original function in the time domain and \\\\( F(s) \\) its image in the complex domain. An intervention is represented by the multiplication of \\\\( F(s) \\) with a complex exponential \\\\( e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is originally transformed from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and is predicted to later evolve without additional changes, will the resulting inverse transform \\\\( L^{-1}\\{ F(s) \\} \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as \\\\( f(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}\\{ F(s) \\} \\\\) will precisely recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from its transformed state, hence at any time \\\\( T \\\\), it matches \\\\( f(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transformation → F(s); Intervention → e^{as} * F(s); Inverse Laplace transformation → L^{-1}{F(s)}; L^{-1}{F(s)} → f(T); f(t) → F(s)"
