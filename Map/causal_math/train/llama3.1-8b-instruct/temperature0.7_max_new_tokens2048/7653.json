  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) is applied at \\( z_0 \\) without any further modification, does the value of \\ T(p(z_0)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) change significantly from \\( g(z_0) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves integrating the exponential of the square of z, significantly altering the behavior and magnitude of the function compared to the initial function \\\\( g(z_0) = e^{z_0^2} \\). The integral accumulates and magnifies changes, leading to a different function value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
