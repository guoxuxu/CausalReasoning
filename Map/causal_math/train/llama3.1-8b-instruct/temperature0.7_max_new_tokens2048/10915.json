  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nIf at a given \\( x = x_2 \\), a new function \\( \\psi(z) = z + c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number) is applied as intervention, will the final \\( z(x_3) \\) for \\( x_3 > x_2 \\) depend only on the outcomes of \\( f(x) \\) and not on \\( \\phi \\) or \\( \\psi \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( \\psi(z) \\) alters the trajectory by adding the constant \\( c \\), which means the final state \\( z(x_3) \\) depends on \\( c \\) as well as the previous transformations \\( \\phi \\) and the integral transformation \\( f(x) \\). Thus, \\( z(x_3) \\) depends on all applied transformations, showing dependency beyond just \\( f(x) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
