  "Problem": "Analyzing an electrical system described by the voltage-current relationship using Laplace Transformations. Let \\\\( V(s) = Z(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) \\\\), \\\\( I(s) \\\\), and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of voltage, current, and impedance, respectively. Consider varying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by adding a capacitor with impedance \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\\\), where C is the capacitance.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a specific time, say by adding a resistor (changing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) + R \\\\)), will the resulting \\\\( V(s) \\\\) strictly depend on the new value of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on the characteristics of the original inductive-capacitive system?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\( V(s) \\\\) will depend on all components of the system, including both the original mixed inductive-capacitive impedance and the newly added resistive component. The overall system response is shaped by the compound effect of these components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
