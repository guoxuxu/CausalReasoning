  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by two variables x and y, related by the complex function \\( z = x + yi \\). We look into how the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z \\, ds \\) influences z over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\( z(T) \\), is it possible to determine precisely which interventions (either \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) were applied just by analyzing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation effects of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) might overlap, resulting in similar final states for different combinations of applications. The complex integration and dependency on exponential terms in A and B create multiple potential histories leading to the same \\( z(T) \\), which are not distinguishable from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
