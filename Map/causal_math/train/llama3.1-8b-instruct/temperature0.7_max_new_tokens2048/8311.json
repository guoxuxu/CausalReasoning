  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( w(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and subsequently transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of this system under various transformations and interventions.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying another function \\\\( g(z) = z + k \\\\) (where k is a constant) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely influenced by \\\\( w(z) \\\\) and not \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of modification by shifting \\\\( z \\\\) linearly, further influencing the ultimate state at T > t_1. Thus, the final output at \\\\( w(z(T)) \\\\) depends on the compound effects of both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), alongside the original dynamic function \\\\( w(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
