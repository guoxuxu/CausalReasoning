  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf initially, at t = 0, the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by \\( z(0) = z_0 \\), and evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will its Fourier transform at any time \\\\( t \\\\) reflect the same frequency spectrum as the initial \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) indicates that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is of the form \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). A Fourier transform of such a function results in a frequency spectrum that centers around \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), unchanged by the scalar factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Thus, the frequency spectrum remains focused on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), reflecting that of the initial condition unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
