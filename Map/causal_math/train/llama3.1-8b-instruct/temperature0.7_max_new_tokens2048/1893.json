  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of a system governed by a matrix equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a matrix with eigenvalues. To study this system, a transformation \\\\( z = T^{-1}x \\\\) is applied, where T is a transformation matrix, converting the system to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Jz \\\\) with J being the Jordan form of M.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z = T^{-1}x \\\\) is applied and the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Jz \\\\) from initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, does the behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) necessarily reflect the stability dictated by the eigenvalues of M?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation to Jordan form (J) and its subsequent evolution directly reflect the eigenvalues of M. Since eigenvalues determine stability, the behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) corresponds to the predicted stability or instability of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation of x to z → Eigenvalues of M determine stability; Transformation of z to x → Stability of x(t) is determined by stability of z(t); Initial condition z_0 → z(t); Evolution of z(t) → z(t); Evolution of z(t) → x(t); Stability of J → Stability of z(t); Stability of M → Stability of J; Transformation of M to J → J; Eigenvalues of M → Stability of M"
