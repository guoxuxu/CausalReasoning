  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u + \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t} e^{-\\\\alpha(t-s)}u(s)ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) are constants. The behavior of the system is analyzed when subject to transformations using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), could we determine precisely which transformations (initial Laplace transform, inverse Laplace at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) were used by only knowing \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), it is challenging to definitively infer the exact sequence or types of transformations that were applied. The influence of the initial and intervening transformations, combined with the integrative and decay effects of the differential equation, makes it infeasible to uniquely identify the transformations based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
