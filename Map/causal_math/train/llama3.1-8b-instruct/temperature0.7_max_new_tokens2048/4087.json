  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) which is derived as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\), where A represents a constant. The system is studied under a Heaviside step function input \\\\( u(t) = 1(t) \\\\) converted into the Laplace domain to form \\\\( U(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\). The output in the Laplace domain is then \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( F(s) = s - K \\\\), where K is a constant, is introduced post-initial conditions at time T, does this intervention ensure that the final system output \\\\( Y(F) \\\\) solely depends on the new K and the original system input?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( F(s) \\\\) modifies the output path and its characteristics. The resultant output \\\\( Y(F) \\\\) will depend on both the new K and the original system's A parameter, as both will influence the final output by altering the nature of the system's transfer function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
