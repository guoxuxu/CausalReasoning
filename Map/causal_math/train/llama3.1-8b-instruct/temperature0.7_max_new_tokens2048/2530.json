  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nCan we precisely reconstruct the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t from \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) without knowing the specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation performed by \\\\( T \\\\) convolves the original signal with the exponential term, causing loss of certain frequency information. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\), the exact reconstruction of z(t) from \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) is undetermined due to the integral's smoothing effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
