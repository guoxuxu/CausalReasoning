  "Problem": "Assess the effects of a Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant, and its impact on system behavior described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nGiven the system's output \\\\( x(t) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively infer whether the input was \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or its Fourier and inverse Fourier transformed counterpart without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transformed version, if perfectly transformed, should theoretically yield the same output in an ideal linear time-invariant system. However, practical factors such as numerical errors, approximations, and non-ideal behavior of real systems prevent definitive backward inference from output to specific input form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
