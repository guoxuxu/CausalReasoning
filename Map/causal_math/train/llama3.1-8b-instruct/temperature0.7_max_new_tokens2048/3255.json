  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z = x^T C x + bx\\\\), where x is a vector, C is a symmetric matrix, and b is another vector. We are examining the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx\\\\), where D is a regular matrix, on the output z.\n\nIf at a specific time an intervention modifies x not according to D but another matrix E (transformation \\\\(j(x) = Ex\\\\)), does the resultant z depend solely on the intrinsic parameters C and b, without influence from the history of transformations D and E?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of z will depend on how x has been transformed by E and previously by D, due to the interaction of these transformations with C and b. Both transformations modify the trajectory of x in the calculated z, making it dependent on D, E, as well as C and b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
