  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), where X and Y are complex constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of applying Fourier transformation on this signal and then modifying its spectrum by a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed signal, can we unequivocally determine the original time-domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any modifications or additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the Fourier transformed signal strictly corresponds to knowing its spectrum. Since the Fourier transform is uniquely invertible under ideal conditions, the original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from its spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
