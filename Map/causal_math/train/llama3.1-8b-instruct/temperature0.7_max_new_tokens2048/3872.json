  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\( T \\) defined by \\( T[u](x, t) = \\int K(x, y, t) u(y, t) dy \\), where \\( K \\) is a kernel function.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( u(x, T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( T[u] \\), \\( S[u] \\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\( u(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( u(x, T) \\) could arise from various combinations of transformations with \\( T[u] \\) and \\( S[u] \\), especially if both kernels \\( K \\) and \\( M \\) have overlapping effects or if their interaction with \\( L \\) is non-trivial. Distinguishing between these causes based on the endpoint alone is generally unfeasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
