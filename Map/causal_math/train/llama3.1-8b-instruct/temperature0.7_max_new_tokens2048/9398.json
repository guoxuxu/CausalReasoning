  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear whether the starting point was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\). As such, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely achieved without additional information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the value of B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
