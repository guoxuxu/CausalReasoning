  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the equation \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit, and \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix. We are examining the role of the operator \\\\(T(z) = e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, in transforming the state of the system over time.\n\nDoes applying \\\\(T(z)\\\\) to the initial state \\\\(z(0)\\\\) and letting the system evolve under \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\) lead to the same behavior at time \\\\(T\\\\) as evolving \\\\(z(0)\\\\) from the beginning under \\\\(z'(t) = iAz(t)\\\\) without applying \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\(T(z)\\\\) modifies the initial conditions through the matrix exponential \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\), which will affect the trajectory differently due to potential non-commutativity of \\\\(B\\\\) with \\\\(iA\\\\). This leads to a distinct state evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
