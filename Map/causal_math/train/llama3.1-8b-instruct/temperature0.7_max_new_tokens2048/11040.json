  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can one determine precisely what interventions (if any) were applied (both Fourier transform and exponential modulation), knowing only the final state and the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) does not uniquely specify the applied interventions due to the linearity of the PDE and the transforms. Multiple initial conditions or interventions may yield the same final outcome, especially without additional data linking specific interventions to the observed final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
