  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and if so, deduce the properties of C?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different configurations of the matrices A, B, and C. Without additional information about the trajectory or the specific effects of the matrix C, it's impossible to conclusively back out whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied and what characteristics C held.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
