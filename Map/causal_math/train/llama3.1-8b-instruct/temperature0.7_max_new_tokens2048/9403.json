  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate the causality in the changes of original function and its behavior under various transformations.\n\nIf a causative intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + \\\\sin(bt) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at any s purely reflect the transformation added?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds a new component, \\\\( \\\\sin(bt) \\\\), which has its own Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{b}{s^2 + b^2} \\\\). The resulting Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) becomes a combination of the transforms of both components, intertwined in a way that is influenced by \\\\( f(t) \\\\)'s characteristics and the new sine function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
