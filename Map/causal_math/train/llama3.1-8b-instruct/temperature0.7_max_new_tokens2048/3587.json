  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = pz' + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants and \\\\( z' \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nSuppose at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another linear operator \\\\( M \\\\) defined as \\\\( Mz = rz'' + sz \\\\) (where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are constants) is applied, will the resultant function \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend strictly on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the new operator \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second operator \\\\( M \\\\) with its distinct effects (acting on the second derivative and the function itself) significantly modifies not just the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but also how its transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) will proceed post-intervention. The interaction between \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), especially in non-simple cases where derivatives of different orders are involved, creates dependencies extending beyond the initial transformation \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
