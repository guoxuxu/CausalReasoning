  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices and u represents a control input. We analyze the behavior of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to express solutions in terms of complex frequencies.\n\nCan the specifics of the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), such as its functional form or timing, be uniquely identified just from the transformed output \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at different frequencies?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the control input \\\\( U(s) \\\\) influences the overall system transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\), but retrieving the exact form or timing of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is generally impossible without additional constraining information, due to the reversal complexity and multiple possible functions that correlate with the same transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
