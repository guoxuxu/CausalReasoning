  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. We are interested in the causality implications of an integral transformation applied to initial conditions given by some function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) related to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a Laplace transform.\n\nCan we determine the exact type of intervention (type and parameters) applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to transform it to \\\\( v(t) \\\\), solely by observing \\\\( h(v(t)) \\\\) at some \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( h(v(t)) \\\\) captures integrated effects influenced by both the initial function and the intervention, but this resultant form generally lacks sufficient information to uniquely determine the parameters of the intervention especially without additional constraints or data about the original function's behavior under different conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
