  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a set of linear algebraic equations driven by a matrix function \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), where A is a diagonalizable matrix. We further examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At}X(t) dt \\\\) on the system.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( X(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify which transformations (\\\\( g(X) \\\\), \\\\( h(X) \\\\), or both) were applied during the time [0, T] based solely on the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant matrix \\\\( X(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various sequences and combinations of transformations due to the combined influence and non-trivial effects of exponential matrix functions and integral transformations working over different intervals. This complexity makes it infeasible to determine the exact path or types of transformations applied only from observing \\\\( X(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
