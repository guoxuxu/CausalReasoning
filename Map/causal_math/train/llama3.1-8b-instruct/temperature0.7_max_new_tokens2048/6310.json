  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by an integral transform \\\\( L[u(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation. Suppose we introduce a perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + p(x) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) solely from the transformed function \\\\( L[v(x)] \\\\), without knowledge of the perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L[v(x)] = L[u(x)] + L[p(x)] \\\\) does not allow us to uniquely resolve \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( p(x) \\\\) or its transform, as the same result could arise from different combinations of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( p(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
