  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a control system operates following a linear equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), with K being a constant coefficient matrix and u representing external control influences. Suppose an experimental transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) is introduced, where A is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new control vector \\\\( u \\\\) is introduced, changing the system's dynamics, does the system's state at time T > t_1 depend only on K, ignoring the effects of A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new control vector \\\\( u \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) indeed modifies the system trajectory based on K. However, since the initial state modification by \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) potentially changes the basis in which the dynamics evolve, the final state at time T is influenced by both A and K. The system’s response reflects composite effects of both matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
