  "Problem": "Explore a system governed by a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z(0) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and consider the effect of a distinct transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex matrix. Analyze the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under various conditions and transformations.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we discern exactly what transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied by only considering the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the precise interventions used cannot be unambiguously determined due to the possible overlapping effects of the matrices \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\) during the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). The transformations can have similar or indistinguishable impacts on the trajectory, making it challenging to pinpoint the specific interventions that were applied from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
