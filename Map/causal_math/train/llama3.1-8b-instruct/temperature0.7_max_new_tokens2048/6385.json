  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\). We explore the effect of a boundary condition transformation, where the transformation is represented by \\\\(g(s) = e^{\\\\lambda s}\\\\) applied along the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial D\\\\).\n\nIf a transformed boundary condition \\\\(g(s)\\\\) is applied at \\\\(s = 0\\\\) and the system is then allowed to evolve with the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) within the domain \\\\(D\\\\) still satisfy the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace equation depends solely on the function \\\\(u\\\\) and not directly on the boundary condition form. Thus, regardless of the boundary transformation, the function \\\\(u\\\\) that solves the equation within \\\\(D\\\\) must still satisfy \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\). The choice of boundary condition affects the specific solution but does not alter the fact that it satisfies the Laplace equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
