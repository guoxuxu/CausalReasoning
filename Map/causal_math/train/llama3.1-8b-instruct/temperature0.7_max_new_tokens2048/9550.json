  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of this transformation is analyzed over time t.\n\nIs it possible to deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately trace back to identify the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial value in a way that is not discernible just by looking at the evolved state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially if the exact time-dependent factor \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) is unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
