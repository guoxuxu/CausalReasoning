  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a function and \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nDuring the computation of \\\\( z(w) \\\\), if after some time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), another exponential factor \\\\( e^{bs} \\\\) (\\\\( b \\\\neq a \\\\)) is introduced, forming a new modified function, will the final result of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) only depend on the original \\\\( x(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention, introducing \\\\( e^{bs} \\\\) at time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), changes the integral to \\\\( \\\\int_0^{s_1} e^{-sw}x(s)e^{as} ds + \\\\int_{s_1}^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s)e^{as}e^{bs} ds \\\\), creating a dependency on both parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) and the point of intervention \\\\( s_1 \\\\). This mixed composition affects the final \\\\( z(w) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
