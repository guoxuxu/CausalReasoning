  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(g(x)) \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), which is subsequently evolved via Laplace transform \\\\( L(h(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\) over time variable t.\n\nGiven the output from the described sequence of transformations and interventions, is it possible to definitively determine whether an inverse Laplace transform was applied at some point?",
  "Explanation": "The final output of these transformations could be similar due to overlapping effects of the Fourier and Laplace transforms in frequency and complex domains. Without explicit markers or additional information, it is not possible to uniquely identify if and when an inverse Laplace transform was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
