  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the function state \\( z(T) \\) with known interventions \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) at different times, is it feasible to precisely identify which transformation was applied first based solely on the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) under complex transformations \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) does not retain straightforward information about the order of application due to the overlapping influence and interaction between the transformed terms and the inherent dynamic system. This results in a complexity that obscures the retrospective analysis of initial versus subsequent transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
