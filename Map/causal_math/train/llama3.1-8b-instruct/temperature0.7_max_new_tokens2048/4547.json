  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We explore the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\\\\\((\\\\mathcal{L})\\\\) on this function with respect to its coefficients \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\alpha u(t) + \\\\beta v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies \\\\( v(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v'(t) = v(t) + w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is another function at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at T > t_1 explicitly reflect this intervention linearly with respect to the original \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace Transform is linear, any additions to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) linearly integrate into the total transform. Thus, the modification leading to \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) directly influences \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), and this change is linear concerning \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and the Laplace Transform of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
