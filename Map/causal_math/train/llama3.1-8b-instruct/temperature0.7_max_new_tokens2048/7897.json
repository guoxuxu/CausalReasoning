  "Problem": "Consider a physical system whose state at time t is given by the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and governed by the second order linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{z} + p\\\\dot{z} + qz = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the effect of transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to a state \\\\(z_0\\\\), and then the system evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{z} + p\\\\dot{z} + qz = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) evolved without applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) initially changes the state to \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0\\\\). The evolution of this transformed initial state under the given differential equation will lead to a trajectory influenced by the complex exponential factor, which may alter both amplitude and phase of the oscillation, resulting in a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
