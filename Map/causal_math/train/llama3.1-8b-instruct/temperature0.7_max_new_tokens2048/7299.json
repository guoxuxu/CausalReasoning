  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. These equations describe the dynamics of two separate systems. We explore the effect of applying the integral transform \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)C} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on these systems.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of a matrix exponential function \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) (where D is constant) is applied to the system, will the new state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T > t_1 be unaffected by the initial application of \\\\( T[f] \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state at time T is a product of interventions and transformations. Applying \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will further modify the trajectory introduced by \\\\( T[f] \\\\), leading to outcomes influenced by both transformations. These applications do not erase or neutralize each other's effects but instead compound them.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
