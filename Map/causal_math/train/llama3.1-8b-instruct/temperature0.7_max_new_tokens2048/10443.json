  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the transformation \\\\(g(X) = X - k\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(X(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) end up being the same as if no transformations were applied at all?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(X)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) does not simply undo the earlier transformation \\\\(h(X)\\\\) because the stochastic nature of the process, driven by \\\\(dW_t\\\\), means that the diffusion term and the potential state-dependent drift have already influenced the path of \\\\(X_t\\\\). Thus, even though theoretically the transformations are opposites, the random trajectory induced by the Brownian motion renders their effects non-reversible over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
