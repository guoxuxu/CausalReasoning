  "Problem": "A two-dimensional linear system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) represents a rotation. We examine the effect of the function \\\\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t, where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), which also results in a rotational transformation.\n\nBy only observing the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine what interventions were implemented (whether \\\\( f(y) \\\\), \\\\( g(y) \\\\), or both) throughout the process?",
  "Explanation": "Given that different matrices have distinct effects (rotational vs. shearing), and considering the linear superposition and potential symmetries in linear transformations, different combinations of A, B, and C could theoretically result in the same endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\). Thus, the exact interventions (whether rotations by B, shearing by C, or both) cannot be uniquely determined just from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
