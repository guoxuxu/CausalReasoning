  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant complex number. We examine the outcome of the transformation specified by the function \\\\(h(z) = e^{Et}z\\\\), with E being another constant complex number, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was just subjected to natural evolution up to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the initial value, changing the trajectory of the system. The transformation applied by \\\\(e^{Et}\\\\) can essentially alter the dynamics depending on the values and relationship between E and D, resulting in a current state at time T that differs from simple evolution under D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
