  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an operation such as a convolution with a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied as an intervention and the system continues to evolve under the same PDE, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original PDE and not on the convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with convolution alters the state variable \\\\( u \\\\) by integrating additional information or disturbance into the system, thereby directly influencing the subsequent evolution of \\\\( u \\\\) under the PDE. Hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on both the original PDE dynamics and the convolutional effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
