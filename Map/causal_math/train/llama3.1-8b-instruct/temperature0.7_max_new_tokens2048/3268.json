  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function u(x, t) and consider its evolution under the given differential equation.\n\nConsidering we observe the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) after applying a transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the initial condition was solely modified by the Fourier transform or if the Laplace transform was also used, based only on \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform characteristics might be deducible, the precise nature and impact of the Laplace transformation (or its absence) on \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely established without additional information. Different initial conditions and/or transformations could lead to similar states at time T, especially considering potential overlaps in transformation effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
