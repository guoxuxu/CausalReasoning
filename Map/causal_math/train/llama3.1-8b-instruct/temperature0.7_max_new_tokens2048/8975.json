  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying the signal with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the frequency spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) then depend only on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( v(t) \\\\) essentially attempts to counteract the shift caused by \\\\( z(t) \\\\); however, the timing and exact frequency alignments crucially influence the outcome. The spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) will still reflect the cumulative effects of both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), alongside the inherent characteristics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
