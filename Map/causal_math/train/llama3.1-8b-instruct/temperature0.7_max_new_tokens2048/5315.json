  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace transform of its input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), giving \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\. The output of the system is described by the function \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We examine the effects of modifying the input signal using the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x(t) * e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the transfer function to \\\\( H'(s) = H(s) + K(s) \\\\) (where \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is another transfer function) at a certain time, will the final output state \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be influenced by the initial transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention modifying the transfer function, the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) still relies on the modified Laplace transform \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\) of the input signal. Thus, the endpoint reflects the initial transformation influence, compounded by the new transfer function characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
