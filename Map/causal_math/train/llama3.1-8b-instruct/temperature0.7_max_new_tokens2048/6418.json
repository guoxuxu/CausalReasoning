  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a curve in the complex plane given by \\\\( z = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, describing an oscillator. We investigate the effects of a linear transformation described by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) which rotates and scales the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after being evolved from an unknown initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether it was transformed by \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the initial state was modified by the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to the potential changes in magnitude and orientation imposed by the matrix.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
