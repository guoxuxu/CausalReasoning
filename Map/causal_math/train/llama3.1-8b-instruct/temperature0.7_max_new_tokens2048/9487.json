  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reliant solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of both \\\\( B \\\\) in the integral transformation and \\\\( C \\\\) in the intervention alters the system's evolution pathway. Therefore, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect influences from \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\), showing that it is not solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
