  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) is applied to a complex variable z, where A is a complex constant. The effect of this transformation over time, modeled by \\\\( z(t) = f(z(t-1)) \\\\\\), is assessed with and without interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied repeatedly starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without any external intervention, will the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) be geometrically spiraling outwards if \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(A) > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) rotates and scales the complex number z. Repeated applications result in continued rotation and scaling according to the real part of A, and if \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(A) > 0 \\\\\\), it continuously scales z outward, creating a spiral effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
