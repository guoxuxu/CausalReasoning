  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. Consider a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-iwx} u(x) dx\\\\) being applied as a transformation.\n\nHaving observed the temperature distribution \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at time T, is it possible to reconstruct the exact initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial condition was transformed by the Fourier technique and not reversed correctly or noted, important phase information and spatial characteristics might be altered or lost. Recovering the exact original state without this knowledge is not feasible due to the irreversible information loss in practical scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
