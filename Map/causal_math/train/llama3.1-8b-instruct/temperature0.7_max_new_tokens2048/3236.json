  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation in a vector space under the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{(x-t)^2} f(t) dt \\\\). The system's dynamics are influenced by an externally applied multiplicative function \\\\( g(t) = t^2+1 \\\\) at different times.\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\), can we precisely determine whether both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) were applied, or either, by merely knowing the output at T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of modifications including both, either, or neither \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) might yield similar outcomes due to the non-linear interaction within the integral and the cumulative effect of different function modifications at different stages. Thus, without additional information, the specific interventions cannot be deduced solely from the final output \\( T[f](T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
