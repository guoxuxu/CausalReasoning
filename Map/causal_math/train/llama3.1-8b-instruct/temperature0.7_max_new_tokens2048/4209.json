  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) for complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. By defining a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix, we test the effect over a period of time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions through \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). This action potentially alters the trajectory since the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of D could profoundly influence the evolution, leading to a different state at time T than if it had evolved naturally under C alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
