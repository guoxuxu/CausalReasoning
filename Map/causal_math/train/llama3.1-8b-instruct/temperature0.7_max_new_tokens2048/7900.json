  "Problem": "Consider a physical system whose state at time t is given by the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), and governed by the second order linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{z} + p\\\\dot{z} + qz = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the effect of transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T2)\\\\) after interventions were possibly applied at various times, can we explicitly determine which transformations or interventions were used by only analyzing \\\\(z(T2)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences of interventions (including different parameters like \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)) could lead to the same final state \\\\(z(T2)\\\\) due to the potentially overlapping effects of applying transformations akin to \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(k(z)\\\\). This non-uniqueness, exacerbated by the differential equation's inherent properties and the possible effects of superposition principle in linear systems, makes it impossible to retroactively specify which interventions occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
