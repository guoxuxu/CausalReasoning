  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Qi \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We analyze the behavior under a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 precisely after observing its Fourier transform spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the exact time-evolution dictated by P and Q?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing how P and Q influence the function over time, the original condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T. As changes in amplitude and phase due to P and Q affect the spectrum temporally, the inversion from frequency back to time domain lacks the necessary data on these influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
