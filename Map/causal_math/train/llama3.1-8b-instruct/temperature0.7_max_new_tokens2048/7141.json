  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nIf we change the initial conditions from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T purely be dictated by the original system dynamics under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the initial condition by multiplying by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) effectively introduces a phase shift in the complex plane for \\\\( z(0) \\\\). This changes both initial real part \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and imaginary part \\\\( y(0) \\\\), which modifies the trajectory and subsequent state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T due to the non-linear coupling between x and y.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
