  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) for \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq T \\), resulting in \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}e^{At}v \\, dt \\), will this outcome depend only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) \\) entails integrating \\( z(t) \\) multiplied by another matrix exponential \\( e^{Bt} \\), leading to outcomes dependent on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The interaction between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) significantly influences the result, with their respective commutation properties affecting the integration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
