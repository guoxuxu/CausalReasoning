  "Problem": "In a control system, a linear time-invariant differential equation describes the system's dynamics: \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The effect of control input is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), where K is a control matrix applied at time t.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), and knowing the system matrix D, can we precisely identify what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), based solely on the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of D and the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), the potential for different combinations of K and M (in terms of timing, intensity, etc.) to produce the same endpoint makes it impossible to definitively trace back and determine the specific interventions used. The non-unique way in which matrix exponentials can be combined adds to this uncertainty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
