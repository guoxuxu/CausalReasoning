  "Problem": "In a control system, the effect of a matrix operator \\\\( P \\\\) on a signal's Fourier transform is examined. Given a signal function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), its Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is denoted by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The operator \\\\( P \\\\) acts on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) to produce \\\\( P(X(\\\\omega)) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf we observe the output from the system characterized by \\\\( G(s) \\\\) to be equivalent to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we deduce that the operator \\\\( P \\\\) was definitively not applied to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) before running through \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\( P \\\\) followed by \\\\( G(s) \\\\) leads to the output being exactly \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), identical to the scenario where \\\\( P \\\\) is not applied, we cannot conclude whether \\\\( P \\\\) was applied or not solely based on this output match.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
