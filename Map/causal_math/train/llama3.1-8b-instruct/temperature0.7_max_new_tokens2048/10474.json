  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the squared function, can we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the Fourier transform of the squared function doesn't provide a direct means to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\), since multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can lead to the same squared value due to the periodic and non-injective nature of squaring complex numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
