  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = C e^{At} \\\\), where A is a skew-symmetric matrix and C is a constant matrix. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transform given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation matrix \\\\( D \\\\) is added to A, resulting in a new system \\\\( y'(t) = C e^{(A+D)t} \\\\), and then the Laplace transform is applied, will the new transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) be unaffected by \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( D \\\\) modifies the system matrix \\\\( A \\\\), thus changing the dynamics represented in the exponent, leading to a different Laplace transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) that reflects this change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
