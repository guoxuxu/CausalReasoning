  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\) applied to the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) where x is a spatial variable.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were used (whether Laplace Transform, Fourier Transform, or both), only by analyzing the state at \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the Laplace and Fourier Transforms modify the solution's spectral properties, often in overlapping ways that can result in indistinguishable effects at the endpoint. This overlap creates ambiguity in discerning which transformations were applied solely based on the endpoint analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
