  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform intervention \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the state of the system at time \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transform had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied, it's uncertain if the observed state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) was directly influenced by the heat equation alone or was altered by the Fourier transform, which changes the modal distribution across the spatial frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
