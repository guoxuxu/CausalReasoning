  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf a specific force pattern \\\\( F(x,t) = g(t) \\\\) is applied at some time interval and then switched off, will the string's displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) solely depend on the original wave equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\) for times larger than when \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was last applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction and subsequent removal of the force \\\\( g(t) \\\\) impacts the initial conditions post-intervention. Therefore, the resultant trajectory of the string is influenced by the interplay of the natural dynamics and the temporary forcing, affecting the displacement at later times.",
