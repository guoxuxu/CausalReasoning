  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nIf an intervention using another mapping function \\\\( h(x) = e^{i\\\\phi}x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the oscillator's position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), ignoring \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations, \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\), impact the phase of the oscillator, thus affecting the trajectory and ultimately the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The final position depends on the compounded effects of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) along with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
