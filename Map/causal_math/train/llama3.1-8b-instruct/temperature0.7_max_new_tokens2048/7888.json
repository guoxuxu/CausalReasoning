  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain where \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. The circuit is initially characterized by an impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\). An operational intervention modifies the circuit's impedance to \\\\(Z_2(s) = Z_1(s) + \\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) is another impedance term added.\n\nGiven an observed circuit response at time \\\\(T\\\\), and knowing that an intervention occurred, can we unequivocally determine whether the system's impedance was changed to \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\) or remained as \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the knowledge of an intervention, the specific nature of the impedance change (whether it was to \\\\(Z_2(s)\\\\) or remained \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\)) cannot be accurately determined solely based on the observed response at \\\\(T\\\\). This is due to the potential overlap in responses resulting from different applied inputs and the non-unique inversion problem in impedance analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
