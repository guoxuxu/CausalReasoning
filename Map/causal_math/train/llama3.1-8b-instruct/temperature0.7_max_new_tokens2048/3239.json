  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) by a linear operator L, defined as \\\\(L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where A is a complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf another linear operator \\\\(M[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where B is another complex constant, is applied at some time t < T, will the resulting transformation still primarily reflect e^{At}?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(M[z(t)]\\\\) introduces a new transformation parameter B, which can significantly modify the outcome depending on the interaction between A and B. The result will inherently be a composite effect influenced by both exponential terms, not uniquely by \\\\(e^{At}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
