  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, influencing the evolution depending on both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\). The transformations due to \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) individually affect trajectory and as a result change the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
