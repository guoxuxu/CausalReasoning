  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We examine how manipulating the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) through multiplication by \\\\( t^n \\\\) affects its transform and the inverse process.\n\nGiven the final transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can it be inferred what specific operations were applied (either \\\\( t^n f(t) \\\\), \\\\( t^m f(t) \\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific operations from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone is challenging as multiple combinations of \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\) can result in the same or indistinctive transforms. This uncertainty arises due to the linear and overlapping effects of multiplying by different powers of \\\\( t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "n → t^n f(t); F(s) → both t^n f(t) and t^m f(t); t^m f(t) → t^n f(t) when m ≥ n; t^n f(t) → F(s)"
