  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iDt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, represents a transformation applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iEt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by \\\\( C \\\\) and not \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( E \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with functions \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) both introduce modifications impacting the trajectory of \\\\( z \\). The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by the initial transformation \\\\( D \\\\) as well as the later intervention \\\\( E \\\\), each contributing to shifts in phase, thereby showing dependency on \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( E \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
