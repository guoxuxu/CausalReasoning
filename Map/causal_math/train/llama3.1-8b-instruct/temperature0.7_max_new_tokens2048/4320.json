  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), widely known as the Laplace transform, applied to the function over time.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\) be uniquely identified from the time-domain function resulting from the inverse transform and intervention applied to the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting time-domain function from the series of transformations and interventions exhibits a combination of behaviors influenced by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\), making it challenging to disentangle and uniquely identify the effects of each parameter without additional constraints or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
