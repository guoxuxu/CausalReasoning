  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. Over time, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( T \\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely recovered without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied to the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involves integration that obscures the specific attributes of the starting complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), since multiple initial values could lead to similar transformation outputs depending on their integration and exponential interaction over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
