  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Laplace transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) with a constant matrix A on a complex function space. The transformed function is \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\). We will analyze the function after applying an inverse Laplace transform, possibly with an operational matrix M applied to it.\n\nCan we determine that only the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) followed by the inverse transformation and application of \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) resulted in \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\), solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations and interventions leading to \\\\( g^{\\\\prime \\\\prime}(t) \\\\) based solely on its current state is challenging due to the potential for different matrices A and M to generate similar or the same results, especially without knowledge of their specific forms or the initial conditions prior to transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
