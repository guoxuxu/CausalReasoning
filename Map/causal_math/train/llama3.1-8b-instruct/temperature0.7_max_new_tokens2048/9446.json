  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t that satisfy a coupled differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. We investigate how the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), impacts causal inference.\n\nCan we deduce the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) across all frequencies without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Even with access to \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at all frequencies, reconstructing the exact initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) (both \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\)) requires more information about the phase relationships and initial conditions due to the complex interactions between A, B, C, and D.",
