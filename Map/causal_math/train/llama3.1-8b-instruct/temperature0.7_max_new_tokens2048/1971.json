  "Problem": "Investigate the interaction of a discrete dynamic system characterized by the linear mapping equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), in which M is a constant matrix. Consider the transformation induced by the function \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix that acts at a specific moment.\n\nAssuming a second function \\\\( h(x) = Ex \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\( n = k \\) where \\( k < N \\), does the end state at \\( n = N \\) only depend on M and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The state evolution depends on all transformations applied. Though the system evolves primarily under M, interventions \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) = Ex \\\\) modify it, affecting the final state at \\( n = N \\). Therefore, the end state depends on M, D, and E and their interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
