  "Problem": "Consider the impact of Laplace Transform on the solution of a differential equation. The original equation is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} + 3u = 0 \\\\), and we study the implications of solving this equation using the Laplace Transform. Furthermore, let's explore the scenario where the initial condition is modified by \\\\( u(0) = K \\\\) where K is a constant.\n\nGiven a solution in the Laplace domain for \\\\( u(t) \\\\) derived from the differential equation, can we reliably revert to the original differential equation without knowing if the initial condition was changed?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the initial condition or any modification thereof, the back-transformation from the Laplace domain can yield multiple potential differential equations depending on assumed initial conditions, introducing ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
