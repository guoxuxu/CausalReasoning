  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) is applied to a position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the potential \\\\( U(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the particle's position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( U(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) scales the initial position exponentially, which alters the potential energy and hence the particle's trajectory. The new position at time T is affected by the altered potential energy due to the scaling, diverging from the trajectory that would follow from the original potential alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
