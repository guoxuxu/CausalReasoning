  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the behavior of the system under the influence of a linear transformation \\( h(x) = Mx \\), where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nCan the initial state \\( x_0 \\) be uniquely determined from the state \\( x(t) \\) at t = T if it is unknown whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If the application of \\( h(x) \\) at t = 0 is unknown, determining \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(t) \\) is challenging as \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\) could correspond to multiple initial states \\( x_0 \\) for different \\( M \\). Without additional information about \\( M \\), the original \\( x_0 \\) cannot be conclusively retrieved, particularly in view of potential multiplicity in \\( M \\) and its non-commutative nature with \\( D \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
