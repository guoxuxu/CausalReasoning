  "Problem": "We consider a system operating under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical phenomenon (e.g., heat distribution over time), and we explore scenarios where transformations and interventions occur, such as multiplying by a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system's input function is modified by \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then is left to evolve under its original dynamics captured by \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = a (a positive real number) be equivalent to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(t^2 f(t))(a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) substantially modifies the behavior of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), which alters the transformed function resulting in a different Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( t^2 f(t) \\\\) creates additional terms in the s-domain that are not simply a scaling of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
