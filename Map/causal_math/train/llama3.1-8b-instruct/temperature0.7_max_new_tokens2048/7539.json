  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled by a differential equation involving complex functions and integral transformations, specifically \\\\(I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)A}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where I is the current, V is the voltage, A is a constant matrix, and t is time.\n\nIf another voltage function \\\\(g(V) = e^{Ct}V\\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resulting current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(g(V) = e^{Ct}V\\\\) introduces an extrinsic factor influencing the voltage and hence the integral computation for current. The result is dependent not only on A but also significantly on the matrix C, affecting the exponential transformation and the current's value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
