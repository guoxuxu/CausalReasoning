  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nGiven the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we conclusively determine the initial temperature T_0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation has been applied, there could be multiple initial conditions (i.e., \\\\( T_0 \\\\) or the square root of \\\\( T_0 \\\\) if it were squared initially) that lead to the same observed temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\). The lack of information about the application of the transformation introduces ambiguity in deducing \\\\( T_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
