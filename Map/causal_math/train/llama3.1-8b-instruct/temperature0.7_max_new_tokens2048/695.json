  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the function \\\\( V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI \\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(I\\\\) is current as a function of time. An integral transform (Laplace Transform) is applied to shift the problem into the complex frequency domain as \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a constant voltage source \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is externally applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( I(s) \\\\) still be determined only by \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) without the effect of \\\\( V_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the addition of \\\\( V_0 \\\\) alters the system by introducing a new term in the Laplace domain, such that \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) + \\frac{V_0}{s} \\\\), and consequently the solution for \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is affected by these conditions, showing dependence on \\\\( V_0 \\\\) as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
