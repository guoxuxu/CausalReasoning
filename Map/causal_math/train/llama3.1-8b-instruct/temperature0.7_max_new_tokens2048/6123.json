  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The influence of an added Laplace transformation, defined by \\( f(z) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\), on the function \\( z(t) \\) is explored, where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention involving a different transformation, \\( g(z) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(\\xi) \\) (where \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) represents the Fourier Transform and \\( \\xi \\) is a frequency variable) is applied, will the final form of \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) be independent of both the initial Laplace transformation and the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace and Fourier transformations affect different aspects of the function \\( z \\) (with Laplace affecting exponential decay and Fourier affecting frequency components). The final form of \\( z(T) \\) depends on how these transformations interplay with the native evolution under the differential equation, making the final state a complex amalgamation dependent on both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
