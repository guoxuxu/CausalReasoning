  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its application within a Laplace Transform context \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\). This scenario explores how the transformation behaves under varying conditions and manipulations.\n\nIs the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\) for \\\\(t > 0\\\\) equal to \\\\(\\\\Gamma(0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}/t\\\\, dt\\\\) diverges, and therefore, the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\) is not properly defined as \\\\(\\\\Gamma(0)\\\\), which itself is undefined. This showcases the limitation of direct Laplace Transforms on certain function types.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
