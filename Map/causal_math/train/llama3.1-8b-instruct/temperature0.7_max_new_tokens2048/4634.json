  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at some frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), is it possible to exactly retrieve the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without any additional information about the parameters or evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts the time domain into the frequency domain, blending all temporal information. Therefore, knowledge of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone is insufficient to exactly determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing about the contributions of \\\\( k \\\\) and the dynamics specified by the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
