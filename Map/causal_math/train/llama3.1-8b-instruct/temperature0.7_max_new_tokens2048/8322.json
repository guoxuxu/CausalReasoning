  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The function is subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear information on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's challenging to reverse engineer the system back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential modification imposed by \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\), making it impossible to assure the specific initial state, especially in the presence of non-commuting matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
