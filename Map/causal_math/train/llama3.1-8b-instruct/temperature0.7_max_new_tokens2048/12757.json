  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\), denoted \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\). We explore the implications of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\), whose transform is \\\\( H(s) \\), and its effect on the inverse transform \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the function resulting from the convolution in the time domain \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\), can we deduce the separate original functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without further information about either \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or additional constraints, it is not possible to uniquely determine the original functions just from their convolution. Many different function pairs can result in the same convolution result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
