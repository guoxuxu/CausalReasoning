  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven observation of the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to infer whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowledge of \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given only the transformed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) and no information about the matrix \\\\(M\\\\), it is not possible to infer conclusively whether the initial state was transformed. Various combinations of \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) could lead to the same observed state, making the transformation indeterminable without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
