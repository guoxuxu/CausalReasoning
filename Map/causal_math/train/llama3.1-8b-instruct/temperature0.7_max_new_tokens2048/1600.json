  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^4 + i \\\\cdot t^3 \\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation on this function over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed version of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), can we determine precisely what changes or interventions occurred in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) just by analyzing the transformed expression?",
  "Explanation": "By comparing the original Laplace transformed function of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with that of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), differences in terms and structures can often reveal specific interventions such as the added \\\\( +t^2 \\\\). Each term in the transform corresponds to specific terms in the time-domain expression enabling detailed reverse-engineering of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
