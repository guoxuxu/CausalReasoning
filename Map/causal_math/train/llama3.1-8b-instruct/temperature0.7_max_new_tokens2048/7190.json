  "Problem": "Examine the implications of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), with D as a constant matrix, upon inclusion of a linear operator mapping \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix applied intermittently.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we implicitly ascertain the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, irrespective of knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information on the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) means we can't be certain if the trajectory followed was solely due to the natural dynamics \\\\( Dx \\\\) or affected by the transformation \\\\( e^{Ft}x \\\\). This ambiguity precludes precise determination of \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
