  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform resulting in a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) from the Laplace transform of \\\\( f'(t) = e^{Bt}e^{At} \\\\), can we determine precisely which matrices (\\\\( A \\\\) and/or \\\\( B \\\\)) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) can result in the same transformed function \\\\( F'(s) \\\\), particularly if \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) share eigenvalues or spectral properties. The transformed outcome does not provide enough information to disentangle the effects and uniquely specify \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
