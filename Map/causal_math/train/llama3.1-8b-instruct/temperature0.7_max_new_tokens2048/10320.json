  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\), where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transformation given by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nGiven an altered state measured by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), can we conclusively determine the nature of any interventions (changes to \\( x \\) or application of different transformations) based solely on the output of \\( \\mathcal{L}\\)",
  "Explanation": "The overlap of multiple potential interventions as well as equivalence issues among the transformed states means that the final \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) may correspond to more than one type of alteration in \\( x \\) or applied transformations, making it impossible to unequivocally determine the interventions involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
