  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation, specifically an inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, and then the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed at a later time T, will the observation depend solely on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an inverse Fourier transform mid-evolution introduces a shift back to the time domain, but the previous application of the Fourier transform followed by its inverse can introduce phase shifts or other changes not accounted for solely by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). These transformations alter how the function returns to and behaves in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
