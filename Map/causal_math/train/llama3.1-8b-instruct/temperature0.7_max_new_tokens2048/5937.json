  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is an input vector. The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) also being constant matrices.\n\nIf the function \\\\( Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) modifies the initial state, which affects how the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\). The exponentiation and multiplication by \\\\( C \\\\) alters the starting vector, leading to a potentially different trajectory and thus a different state at any time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
