  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing whether convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the alteration caused by the shift in Laplace transform domain makes it challenging to reliably trace back and reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\), as the original properties are obscured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
