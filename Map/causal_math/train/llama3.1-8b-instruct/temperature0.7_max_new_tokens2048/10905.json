  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions describing the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. We are concerned with how these components transform under the operation \\\\(w(t) = e^{kt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(w(t) = e^{kt}z(t)\\\\) is applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) for the function \\\\(z_0\\\\) and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the function \\\\(w(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) remain the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(e^{kt}z(t)\\\\) scales and rotates the original function \\\\(z_0\\\\), affecting both magnitude and orientation over time. This changes both the growth rate and trajectory of the function relative to the untransformed function, resulting in a different state at time \\\\(T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
