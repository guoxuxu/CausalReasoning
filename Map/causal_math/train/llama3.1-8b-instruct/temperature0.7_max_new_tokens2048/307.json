  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing the system's state over time. We analyze the impact of a Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) which transforms a real function into another real function, typically shifting each frequency component by \\\\(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of another transform \\\\( G \\\\) (e.g., another phase-shifting transform) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend solely on the original dynamics and not on the transforms \\\\( H \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will depend on both the original dynamics and the transforms applied (\\( H \\\\) initially and \\\\( G \\\\) as an intervention). The cumulative effect of these transforms will influence the complete behavior and end state of the system, interacting with and potentially altering the trajectory initiated by the original dynamics.",
