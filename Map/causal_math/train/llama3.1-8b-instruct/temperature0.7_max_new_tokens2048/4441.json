  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + i y(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is examined under this transformation over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own dynamic without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under its natural dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition and thus the trajectory of the complex function over time. Since \\\\( A \\\\) can affect both growth and rotational dynamics in the complex plane, the state at time T is altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
