  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\( \\phi(t) = e^{-at} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to add a factor \\( e^{-bt} \\) for \\( b > 0 \\) without further intervention, will the spectrum \\( z(w) \\) change from the original with only \\( a \\) involved?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the additional factor modifies the decay rate from \\( a \\) to \\( a + b \\), thus changing the spectrum \\( z(w) \\). This results in a modification to its exponential decay characteristics, thereby affecting the rate and form of the function's spectral decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
