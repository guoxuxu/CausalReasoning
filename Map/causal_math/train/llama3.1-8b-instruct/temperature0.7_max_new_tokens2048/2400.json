  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Analyze the impact of applying a boundary condition transformation through \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, y, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( g'(u) \\\\), or none) only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, y, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and the boundary condition sensitivity of the Laplace equation, multiple combinations of initial and intervening boundary condition transformations could yield the same endpoint, making it challenging to distinguish between the interventions used solely based on the endpoint data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
