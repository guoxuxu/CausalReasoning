  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven that the Fourier transform of a function results in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - (w+a)) \\\\), can we specifically identify that the function was intervened by multiplying with \\\\( e^{iat} \\\\) before transforming?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform indicates a shift from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w + a \\\\), multiple interventions (like different phase shifts or added frequencies) could yield the same transformation effect. Without additional data, the specific intervention of multiplying by \\\\( e^{iat} \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
