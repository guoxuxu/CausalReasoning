  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation, \\\\( g(h)(s) = h(s) - s^2 \\\\), is applied as an intervention partway through the interval, say at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original function \\\\( h(s) \\\\), and not on the transformations \\\\( f(h) \\\\) or \\\\( g(h) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(h) \\\\) changes the form of the integrand by subtracting \\\\( s^2 \\\\) from \\\\( h(s) \\\\). This, along with any potential effects from the initial transformation \\\\( f(h) \\\\), impacts the overall value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent not just on \\\\( h(s) \\\\) but also on the modifications introduced by \\\\( f(h) \\\\) and \\\\( g(h) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
