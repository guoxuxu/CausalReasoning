  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int e^{Rt}z dt \\\\) (where R is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only be influenced by the differential equation and not the transformations (both T and S)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the applied transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\). Each transformation contributes additional integrated effects that are compounded with the differential equation's influence, significantly altering the trajectory and the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
