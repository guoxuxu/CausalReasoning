  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied to the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved to t = T under the rule \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without additional intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) deviate from the trajectory of a solution directly evolved from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T[z] \\\\) alters the initial trajectory of the function, as the integral transformation heavily depends on the past states and modifies the present state differently from simple evolution under the differential equation. Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not be the same as merely evolving \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
