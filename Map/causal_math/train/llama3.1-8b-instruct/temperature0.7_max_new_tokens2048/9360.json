  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nGiven the steady state current, can we determine if a parallel resistor \\\\( R_2 \\\\) was added or if adjustments were made to \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\) by observing only the current magnitude, assuming initial conditions and voltage are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Variations in current magnitude at steady state can result from numerous configuration changes including but not limited to alterations in \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), or the addition of \\\\( R_2 \\\\). Without additional phase information or detailed knowledge of the voltage source or initial conditions, distinguishing among these causes based solely on magnitude is highly ambiguous and inconclusive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
