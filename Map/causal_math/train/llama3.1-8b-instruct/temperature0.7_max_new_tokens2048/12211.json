  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nBased on the observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the interventions applied (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be the result of various possible combinations or sequences of interventions due to the potential non-commutative effects of matrix exponentials in C and D. This creates uncertainty in connecting the final state back to specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
