  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x \\) a constant vector in complex space. The function transforms \\( z(t) \\) using an operator \\( T \\) defined as \\( Tz = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another constant matrix and \\( T \\) is a fixed terminal time.\n\nIf an intervention by another operator \\( S \\), defined as \\( S(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{Ct}z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix, is applied before \\( t_1 < T \\), will \\( Tz \\) for \\( t = T \\) still only depend on \\( T \\) and not on \\( A, B, \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( S \\) modifies the course of the evolution by introducing a distinct transformation \\( e^{Ct} \\). Thus, the ultimate state \\( Tz \\) at \\( t = T \\) will depend on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( C \\), and the nature of the interactions between these exponentials within the integral transformations, affecting both the subspace trajectory and the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
