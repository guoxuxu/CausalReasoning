  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of this transformation in the context of the Laplace transform, defined as \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nKnowing the overall resulting Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\), can we determine precisely at what time \\( t_1 \\) the intervention \\( g(z) = e^{-iz} \\) replaced \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) provides a smeared, integral representation of the function over time, making it inherently difficult to pinpoint exact changes or interventions at specific times without additional information. The combined effects of \\( e^{iz} \\) and \\( e^{-iz} \\) over their respective intervals blend in the transform, obscuring the exact transition point \\( t_1 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
