  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\) be a transfer function of a linear time-invariant system, where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. Suppose an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) through this system. We examine the effect of input transformations using a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse on the resulting output.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention alters the system's transfer function to \\\\( H'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + ds + e} \\\\), where \\\\(d\\\\) and \\\\(e\\\\) are new constants, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solely depend on the original transfer function parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention changes the system dynamics completely by replacing the original transfer function. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for times after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will now be governed by the new parameters \\\\(d\\\\) and \\\\(e\\\\), alongside the interaction with the input up to that point. The dependency extends beyond just \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) due to this substantial change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
