  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), deducing the precise transformations applied is ambiguous due to possible equivalence in outcomes from different parameter combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The compounded exponential effects obscure the individual contributions of the transformations, requiring additional information to disentangle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
