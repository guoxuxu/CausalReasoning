  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function over time domain t.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to the Laplace transform without any additional intervention, will the behavior of the resulting function in the s-domain, specifically its poles, solely depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform on \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly translates it into the s-domain as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), indicating poles solely dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). No other factors influence the poles as the transformation is direct and linear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "parameter ω → function z(t); function z(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → poles; parameter ω → poles"
