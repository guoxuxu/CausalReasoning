  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{B(x-s)}u(s)ds \\) on the solution \\( u(x,t) \\), where B is another constant coefficient.\n\nIf \\( T(u) \\) is applied to the initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\), and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( u(x,0) \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\( T(u) \\) to the initial condition alters the solution's shape by convolution with \\( e^{B(x-s)} \\). This change in the initial shape affects how the solution evolves under the differential equation, resulting in a different solution at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
