  "Problem": "In a fluid dynamics context, we consider the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. To study the effect of a varying thermal diffusivity, a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modulates \\\\( k \\\\) as \\\\( k(t) = k_0 h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k_0 \\\\) being the initial thermal diffusivity.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\), can we determine whether a modulating function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied throughout the process?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the evolution of \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) over time or specific boundary conditions, it is challenging to decisively trace back and confirm the presence and form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) solely based on the final temperature distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
