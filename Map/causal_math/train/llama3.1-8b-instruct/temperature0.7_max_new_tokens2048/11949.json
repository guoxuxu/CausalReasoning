  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency, representing the circuit's impedance. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to analyze the circuit's behavior in response to various input signals represented as functions of \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) observed at some complex frequency s, can we uniquely determine the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\), assuming no knowledge of interventions but knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional context or constraints, multiple input signals could produce the same output in presence of a known \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The equation \\\\( Y(s) = Z(s) X(s) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( X(s) \\\\) if only \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is known, as the potential for multiple inputs yielding the same output exists.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
