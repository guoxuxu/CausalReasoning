  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. The function acts on an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\)\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both, were applied by only knowing the endpoint value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of transformations and intervening actions, because both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) could produce similar effects for different initial vectors and matrix parameters. Without additional information on the timeline and nature of the interventions or transformations, it is not possible to uniquely identify the historical actions leading to \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
