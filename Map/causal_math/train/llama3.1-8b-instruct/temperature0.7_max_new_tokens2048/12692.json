  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a signal at time t. Assume that a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformed function is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}[z(t)](\\\\omega) \\\\), which offers a frequency domain representation of the signal.\n\nIf a signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes the Fourier transformation to become \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then this transformed function is evolved with an untouched frequency domain operator without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\) still purely reflect the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "After applying the Fourier transformation, any evolution in the frequency domain (e.g., due to system or environmental factors that aren't modeled) could modify the frequencies or magnitudes, thus altering the reflected dynamics of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This might not purely reflect the initial signal's time-domain characteristics without understanding the context of these changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
