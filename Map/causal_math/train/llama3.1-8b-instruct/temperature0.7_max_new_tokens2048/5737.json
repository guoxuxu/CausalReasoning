  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to initial distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and the system is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) without further interventions, will the distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) modifies the initial conditions. The added term \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) changes the initial heat distribution, influencing how the heat diffuses over time. Thus, the distribution at time T will differ from the case with unmodified initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
