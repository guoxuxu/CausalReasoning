  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of an external force applied to a mechanical system obeying the second order differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The system is subject to an impulse response represented as a transformation \\\\(g(x) = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are matrices and u denotes the control input.\n\nIf an intervention through a new transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx + Eu\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the state of the system \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original setup's parameters (p and q) and not on A, B, D, or E?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention adds another layer of complexity, altering the subsequent trajectory of the mechanical system. The final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will depend on the aggregate effects of the transformations (A, B, D, E) along with the system's inherent properties described by p and q.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
