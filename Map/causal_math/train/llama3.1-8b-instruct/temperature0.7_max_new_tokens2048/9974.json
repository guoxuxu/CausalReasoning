  "Problem": "Consider the impact of two different integral transforms on a function h(t), one being the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and the other being the Fourier Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). These transformations are applied to h(t) to evaluate their influences and potentially infer properties of h(t) from their transformations. The function \\( h(t) = e^{-kt} \\) for \\( k > 0 \\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} \\), can we uniquely determine the constant k in the function h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "From the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s+k} \\), the pole of this transform directly reveals the value of k, enabling us to infer the value of the decay constant k in the exponential function h(t) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
