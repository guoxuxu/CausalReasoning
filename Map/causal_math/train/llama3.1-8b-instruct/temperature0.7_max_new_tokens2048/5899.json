  "Problem": "A system is defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the system's behavior under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) where B is another real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a second transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{iC(t_1-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) (where C is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 only depend on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) involve integral operations with exponential terms, the combined effects of A, B, and C all influence the trajectory and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), due to the nature of the transformations adding up and interacting dynamically.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
