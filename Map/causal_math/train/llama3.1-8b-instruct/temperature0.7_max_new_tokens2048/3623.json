  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an alternating current (AC) described by the complex function \\\\(I(t) = I_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(I_0\\\\) is the initial current amplitude and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation with a Laplace operator defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant) is applied to modify the circuit's response, will the Laplace transform of the modified signal \\\\(I(s)\\\\) for s > \\\\(t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) introduces an additional factor affecting the system's frequency response. The resulting signal modification leads to an altered Laplace transform, making it dependent on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). The factor \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) introduces an exponential growth or decay to the current, affecting the overall system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
