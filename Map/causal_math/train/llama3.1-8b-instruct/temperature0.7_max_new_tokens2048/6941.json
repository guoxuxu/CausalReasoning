  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is subjected to an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\), evaluating the Laplace transform of the function.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is immediately subjected to the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolves over time according to its own dynamics without any intervention, will the transformed state at any t = T be solely dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\) without regard to the parameter \\\\( s \\) in the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform \\\\( T \\\\) involves the parameter \\\\( s \\), significantly affecting how the function is transformed over time. The transformation \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) interacts with the exponential growth rate \\\\( \\omega \\\\), thus the outcome at any time T reflects a combination of both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
