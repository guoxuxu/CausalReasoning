  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine how an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, affects the system.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at T, can we determine if the intervention \\\\( D(z) \\\\) was applied or deduce the matrices A, B, or E?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) could be reached by various configurations and interactions of A, B, and E, and different differential intervention strategies with \\\\( D(z) \\\\). Due to these variations, it's impossible to uniquely ascertain the involvement of specific interventions or matrix values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
