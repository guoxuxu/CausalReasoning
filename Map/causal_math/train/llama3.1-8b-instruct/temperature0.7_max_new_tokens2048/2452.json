  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. Evaluate the system's response to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(s-t)M}z(s) ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nFrom observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we decisively backtrack to determine whether either, both, or none of the transformations \\\\( T[z] \\\\) or \\\\( U[z] \\\\) were applied, based only on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects and potential equivalency in outcomes stemming from different configurations of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) and \\\\( U[z] \\\\), along with the original system dynamics, make it virtually impossible to uniquely decipher the historical application of transformations, leading to potential ambiguities and multiple feasible histories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
