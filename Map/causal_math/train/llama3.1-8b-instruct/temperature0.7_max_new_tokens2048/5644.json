  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a controlled mechanical system whose state variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) as described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Lx + K u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input represented by a function and \\\\( K \\\\) is a constant matrix dictating the influence of \\\\( u \\\\) on the state \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nGiven the final measurement of state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine whether the input scaling by \\\\( c \\\\) or the structural functional change \\\\( d(t) \\\\) was responsible for the observed state output, assuming both were potential interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping potential impacts from scaling and structural modifications to the control input, it is not generally possible to uniquely discern which intervention—or what combination thereof—led to a given final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Multiple scenarios could yield similar outcomes, particularly without exact knowledge of the functions \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u → x; u → dx/dt; L → dx/dt; K → dx/dt; x(T) → final state output; c → u; d(t) → u; c → dx/dt; d(t) → dx/dt; u → final state output; K → final state output; x(T) → final state output"
