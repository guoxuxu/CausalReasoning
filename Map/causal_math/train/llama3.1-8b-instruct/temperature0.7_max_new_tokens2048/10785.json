  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with M being a linear operator. An external force applies a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + k\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where k and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, acting on the state vector \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition to a modified state \\\\( z_0 + k \\\\sin(\\\\omega \\\\cdot 0) z_0 \\\\), which is \\\\(z_0\\\\) as \\\\(\\\\sin(0) = 0\\\\). Although at t=0 the effect seems null, the path dependency introduced by the sin function may influence subsequent behavior, especially if the system is sensitive to initial conditions or non-linear interactions occur.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
