  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is an analytic solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Evaluate how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) influences the system's behavior.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a manipulation based on the results of Fourier transform (e.g., filtering certain frequencies) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the state of the system at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) reflect only the natural progression according to \\\\( P \\\\) uninfluenced by the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which uses information derived from the Fourier transform, actively alters the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its natural progression under \\\\( P \\\\), making it dependent not only on \\\\( P \\\\) but also on the nature of the manipulations enacted at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
