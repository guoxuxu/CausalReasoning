  "Problem": "Analyze a system where the temperature distribution along the line, u(x,t), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where k is the diffusivity constant. We consider the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\), where v is a constant scalar added at a specific time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(h(u) = u - w\\\\) (where w is another constant scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat equation's constant k and not on v or w?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\) and later \\\\(h(u) = u - w\\\\) introduce extra modifying factors that significantly affect the temperature profile at time T. Both the addition and subsequent subtraction alter the evolution path, making the final state dependent on both v and w as well as k. The combined effect of v and w influences the entire system's trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
