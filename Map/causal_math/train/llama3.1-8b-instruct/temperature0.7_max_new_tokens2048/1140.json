  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nAssuming we observe a broad spectrum in the Fourier transform output, can we deduce that an intervention like multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) took place?",
  "Explanation": "A broad spectrum or continuous spectrum in the Fourier transform output, in the context of an initially simple exponential function like \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\), strongly indicates an intervention that altered the frequency components. Multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) is a plausible intervention that would neutralize the frequency and spread the spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
