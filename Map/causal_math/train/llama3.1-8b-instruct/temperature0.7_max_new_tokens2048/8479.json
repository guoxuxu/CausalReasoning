  "Problem": "Consider a system functioning under a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\). The system is influenced by another function \\\\(g(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) applied either initially or during the operation, and the impact on the transform's outcome is analyzed.\n\nAssuming an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) applying another function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\), will the final transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)+g(t)+h(t)\\\\}\\\\) at time T depend solely on \\\\(g(t)\\\\) given that \\\\(f(0)=0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) introduces a new component to the system, which affects the final Laplace transform. The exponential decay introduced by \\\\(h(t)\\\\) contributes to the overall transform, leading to an output that incorporates effects from both \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
