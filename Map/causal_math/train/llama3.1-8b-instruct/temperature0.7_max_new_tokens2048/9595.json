  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nIf an intervention involves modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by multiplying with another exponential signal \\\\( e^{i\\sigma t} \\\\) at time T, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) only show a frequency shift by \\\\( \\sigma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) by another exponential signal shifts its frequency by \\\\( \\sigma \\\\). The Fourier Transform of the modified signal, therefore, becomes centered at \\\\( \\omega + \\sigma \\\\), indicating a direct frequency shift, without affecting other frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
