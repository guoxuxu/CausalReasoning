  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are the real and imaginary parts of z respectively, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is used for transformation of z over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the dynamics described by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the evolution path by influencing the state vector through another exponential transformation. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect cumulative effects of A, B, C, and D matrices, thus not solely depending on A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
