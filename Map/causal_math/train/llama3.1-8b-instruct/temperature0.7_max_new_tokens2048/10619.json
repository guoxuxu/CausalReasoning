  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation application at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), applying \\\\( C \\\\) to \\\\( z(t_1) = e^{At_1}z_0 \\\\) to get \\\\( z(t_1) = Ce^{At_1}z_0 \\\\), introduces additional complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both the original and the intervened transformations, yielding \\\\( z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}(Ce^{At_1}z_0) \\\\), showing a dependence on both the initial condition and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
