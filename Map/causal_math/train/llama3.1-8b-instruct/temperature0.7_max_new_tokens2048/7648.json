  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\( A \\) is a linear operator and \\( b \\) is a vector. We examine how the transformation and its inversion, where applicable, affect behavior over the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{cz} \\\\), with \\( c \\) being a constant complex number.\n\nKnowing only the result of \\( L'(f(z)) \\) at a later time, where \\( L' \\) is another linear transformation, can we identify what prior transformations or interventions (like the change from \\( A \\) to \\( A' \\)) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in potential outputs resulting from different sequences of transformations and the complex interactions between \\( e^{cz} \\), \\( A \\), and \\( A' \\) make it impossible to uniquely backtrack and identify specific interventions or initial states from the final output of \\( L'(f(z)) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
