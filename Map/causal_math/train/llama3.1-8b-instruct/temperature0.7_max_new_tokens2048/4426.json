  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit characterized by its complex impedance \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + R \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is the resistance, \\\\( C \\\\) is the capacitance, and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable from the Laplace transform. We explore the effects when the input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( f(V) = e^{at}V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we infer the original input voltage \\\\( V_0(t) \\\\) form after observing the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing the transformation \\\\( f(V) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to determine whether an additional transformation like \\\\( f(V) = e^{at}V(t) \\\\) was applied to the input. The function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) could substantially alter the spectral characteristics of the input voltage, rendering it impossible to uniquely and accurately deduce \\\\( V_0(t) \\\\) from \\\\( I(t) \\\\) without knowledge of the transformation applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
