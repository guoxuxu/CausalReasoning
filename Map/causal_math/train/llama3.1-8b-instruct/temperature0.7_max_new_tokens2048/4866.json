  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nObserving the transformed Fourier transform output \\\\( F(z(w_0)) \\\\), can we deduce whether the original parameter was \\\\( w_0 \\\\) or another complex number?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) could imply any of a set of original parameters \\\\( w_0, w_1, ..., w_n \\\\) rotated by different multiples of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). Without additional information about \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or the specific rotation applied, identifying the original parameter accurately is not certain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
