  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the system, can it be inferred if the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modulated by \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), assuming no additional knowledge about \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or the modulation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), numerous combinations of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) could result in the same output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), due to the transformation properties and convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform modulation m(t) → system impulse response h(t); system impulse response h(t) → system Laplace Transform H(s); Laplace Transform H(s) → system output y(t); input signal x(t) → system output y(t); system output y(t) → whether input signal x(t) was modulated by m(t)"
