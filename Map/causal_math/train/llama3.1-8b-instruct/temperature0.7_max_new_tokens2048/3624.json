  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an alternating current (AC) described by the complex function \\\\(I(t) = I_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(I_0\\\\) is the initial current amplitude and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation with a Laplace operator defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform \\\\(I(s)\\\\) at any s after the intervention, can we determine precisely what type of intervention (i.e., the value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform offers information about the system's dynamics in the s-domain, it's generally challenging to uniquely extract specific intervention details (value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)) unless additional information about the time-domain behavior or the nature of the intervention is provided. Multiple values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) could result in transforms that fit the observed \\\\(I(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
