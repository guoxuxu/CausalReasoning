  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), in a system governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 2u = 0 \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the modified system when a transformation function \\\\( f(u) = \\\\sin(t)u \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(u) = e^{ct}u \\\\) (where c is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the transformed Laplace transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) at s = 1 be solely influenced by the original differential equation without consideration of the effects from \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) = e^{ct}u \\\\) imposes another layer of transformation affecting the system's behavior. The dynamics and interactions between \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), and the inherent properties of the differential equation collectively dictate the result. Each transformation contributes significantly to the outcome, making it dependent on all factors involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
