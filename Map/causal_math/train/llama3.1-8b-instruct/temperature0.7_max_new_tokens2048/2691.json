  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a closed container, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity constant. We investigate the effect of a spatial transformation \\\\( u' = T(u) \\\\) where \\\\( T \\\\) is a rotation matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) (another rotation matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original fluid dynamics and not on the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) introduce additional rotational effects on the velocity field, affecting both the direction and interactions within the flow dynamics. The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) thus depends on initial conditions, fluid dynamics, and both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
