  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation on a complex function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\\\), where the integral is taken over a suitable contour in the complex plane. We explore how the transformation affects the inversion of the function via the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nConsidering that an unknown filtering function \\\\( H(z) \\\\) was used along with \\\\( G(z) \\\\), can we determine both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\) from the convoluted output obtained after applying the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\) from their convolution result via inverse Laplace transform requires additional information about either function, as the convolution typically erases unique identifiers that distinguish one from another without extra constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "unknown filtering function H(z) → convoluted output; convoluted output → inverse Laplace transform; inverse Laplace transform → g(t); G(z) → g(t); G(z) → integral of e^(tz)g(t)dt; g(t) → G(z); integral of e^(tz)g(t)dt → G(z)"
