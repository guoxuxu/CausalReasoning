  "Problem": "In the context of electrical circuits, consider a linear system represented by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The system is subject to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and produces output \\\\( y(t) \\\\). We explore the effect of a Laplace transform on this system, focusing on the transfer function modification \\\\( H(s) \\\\) changing to \\\\( H(s) + K(s) \\\\), where \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is another transfer function.\n\nGiven the modified system output \\\\( y''(t) \\\\), can we precisely pinpoint which modifications were made (i.e., the original function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the addition of \\\\( K(s) \\\\), or the input alteration by L) merely from \\\\( y''(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapped effects of modifications to the transfer function and input signal make it challenging to disentangle and identify the specific changes responsible for the output \\\\( y''(t) \\\\). Different combinations of initial conditions, modifications by \\\\( K(s) \\\\), and transformations by L could yield the same final output, obscuring the individual impacts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
