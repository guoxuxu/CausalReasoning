  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, having a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. This scenario explores causal inference in system responses by examining different excitation functions and their respective impacts.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from a response, can we infer the specific shape and nature of the input function without prior knowledge of the input?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial input, multiple potential inputs can result in the same output through different convolution products with \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The Laplace Transform does not necessarily allow for unambiguous reconstruction of the original input just from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Input function → y(t); y(t) → Transfer function; Transfer function → H(s); H(s) → s; s → Causal inference; Causal inference → Input function shape and nature"
