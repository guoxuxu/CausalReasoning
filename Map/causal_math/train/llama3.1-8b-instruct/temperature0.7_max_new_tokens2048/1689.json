  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) undergoes Fourier transformation at t = 0 resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[g](f) \\\\) and allowed to evolve as per its intrinsic differential behavior without further manipulations, will \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) at T retain its initial shape modified by the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intrinsic differential equation properties (exponential decay) will manifest in the Fourier transform as a function in frequency that maintains its shape, modulated by the decay dependent on \\\\( \\lambda T \\\\). The decay term transforms as \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) in time, reflecting as an \\(\\omega/( \\lambda^2 + \\omega^2) \\) decay in the frequency response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
