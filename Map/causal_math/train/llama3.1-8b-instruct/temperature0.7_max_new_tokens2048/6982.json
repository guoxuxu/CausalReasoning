  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. This system undergoes an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x t} f(t) dt \\\\), and we explore the influence of this transformation on the system's behavior.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was initially applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data about the intermediate states or the knowledge of the exact effect of \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(0) \\\\), deducing the application of the transformation from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is ambiguous, especially due to the complexity introduced by the Fourier transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
