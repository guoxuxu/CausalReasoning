  "Problem": "Consider a linear system undergoing a Fourier transform, which converts a function of time, \\\\( g(t) \\\\), into a function of frequency, \\\\( G(f) \\\\). The impact of an additional Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} = G(s) \\\\) on this system is explored over time and frequency domains.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( G(f) \\\\) obtained from the Fourier transform, can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing if a Laplace transform was applied previously or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without clarity on whether a Laplace transform was applied before the Fourier transform, uncertainty remains because the Laplace transform could alter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in a way that is not retrievable from \\\\( G(f) \\\\) alone due to its potential for absorbing differing initial conditions and exponential decays.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
