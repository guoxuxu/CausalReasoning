  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined through the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We want to examine the effects of multiplying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by another function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which represents an integral operator, on the original time-domain function z(t).\n\nIf another operator \\\\( G(s) = s \\\\) is applied at a specific time to modify \\\\( W(s) \\\\) and we obtain \\\\( V(s) = G(s)W(s) \\\\), does \\\\( v(t) \\\\), the inverse transform of \\\\( V(s) \\\\), still solely reflect the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) convolved with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( G(s) = s \\\\) transforms \\\\( W(s) \\\\) further into \\\\( V(s) = s W(s) = sZ(s)\\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). The operation modifies the resulting function beyond just the convolution with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), as it now includes differentiation implications due to the \\\\( s \\\\) operator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
