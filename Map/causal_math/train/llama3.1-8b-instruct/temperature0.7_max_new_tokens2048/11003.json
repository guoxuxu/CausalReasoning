  "Problem": "Consider a frequency analysis where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), leading to an output signal represented by the product \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf a filter \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention after the signal is processed by the initial LTI system, will the final output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = F(\\\\omega)Y(\\\\omega) \\\\) only be determined by the initial conditions set by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional filter \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) as an intervention adds another layer of transformation, altering the output beyond the initial conditions provided by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). This intervention modifies the spectral properties further, depending on the nature of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its interaction with the existing processed signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
