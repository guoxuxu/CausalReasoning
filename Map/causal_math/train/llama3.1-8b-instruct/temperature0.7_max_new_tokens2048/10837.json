  "Problem": "Consider the complex plane where functions are mapped using a transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) indicates time. Analyze the impact of this transformation under the integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), reflecting a periodic adjustment over time T.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and this mapping is continued without intervention up to time T, does the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( z' \\\\) is consistently applied, the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is a deterministic function of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given that these parameters dictate the oscillation rate and extent without alteration from external actions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
