  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nGiven \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation integrates \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T] with a weight of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). Without knowing the specific form and impact of this transformation, it's not possible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( w(T) \\\\), especially considering the many potential trajectories \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could have taken.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
