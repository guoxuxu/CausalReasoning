  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical RLC circuit with a voltage source described by a sinusoidal function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the amplitude, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The response of the circuit is analytically described by the Laplace transform of the voltage across different circuit elements.\n\nSuppose we modify the circuit by introducing an additional resistor in series at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Will the steady-state Laplace transform of the circuit's total impedance depend solely on the original configuration, not on the additional resistance?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an additional resistor changes the total impedance of the circuit, thereby altering the Laplace transform of the impedance, and thus the overall dynamics of the circuit by affecting voltage-current relationships across all components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
