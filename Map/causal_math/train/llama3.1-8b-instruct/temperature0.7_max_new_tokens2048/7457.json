  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the function evolves over time t. We investigate how transformations involving the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function affect computations and inferences.\n\nIf \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further modification, and the resulting function is then inversely transformed at time T under the same transformation, does the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) match the original function at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse are mathematically defined to recover the original function when applied consecutively without any intervention. This implies that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be the same as the initial function at time T, given no modifications were done between transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
