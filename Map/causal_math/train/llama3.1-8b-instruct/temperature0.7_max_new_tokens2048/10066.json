  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic model where the temperature of a system \\\\( T \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of an initial condition modification characterized by \\\\( T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a heat source distribution function.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we infer the original heat source distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) without knowing whether the initial condition was modified?",
  "Explanation": "The evolved temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) does not uniquely specify the initial heat source distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\) since many different distributions \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could lead to the same temperature profile at time \\\\( t \\\\) due to the complexity of diffusion processes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
