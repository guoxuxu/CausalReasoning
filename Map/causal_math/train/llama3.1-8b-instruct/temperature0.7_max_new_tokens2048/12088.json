  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space where functions are defined as \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real number. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on these functions across variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( A \\\\) in \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is modified from \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( A + \\\\Delta A \\\\) without any intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) point remain unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( A \\\\) directly alters the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), and since the Laplace transform is sensitive to changes in the function it transforms, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) will also change. The direct dependency of the Laplace transform on the function it operates on ensures that any change in \\\\( A \\\\) modifies the outcome in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
