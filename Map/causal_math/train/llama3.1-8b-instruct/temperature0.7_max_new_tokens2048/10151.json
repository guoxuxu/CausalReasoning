  "Problem": "Consider a function-space where transformations are governed by the Laplace Transform of functions. Let \\\\( p(t) = L[f(t)](s) \\\\) represent the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time variable and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially unknown and is determined to satisfy an integral equation in the form \\\\( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt = F(s) \\\\), which implies \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as the causal element.\n\nSupposing an intervention occurs where a continuous-time filter described by Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to form \\\\( F(s) \\\\times H(s) \\\\), will the resultant transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely depend on the initial \\\\( F(s) \\\\), excluding influence from the nature of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a continuous-time filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\) interacts and mixes with the transform of the original function, thus rendering the resultant \\\\( f(t) \\\\) dependent on both the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and the filter's properties \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
