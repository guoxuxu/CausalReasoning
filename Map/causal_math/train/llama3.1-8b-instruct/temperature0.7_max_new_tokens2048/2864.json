  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and it's operated on by the Laplace transform defined by the integration transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). We examine how the operations affect the function over time and how interventions alter its behavior.\n\nGiven only the transformed result \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) at certain values of \\\\( s \\\\) after applying an unknown scalar intervention, can the original non-scalared function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the scalar used be identified uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "The identification of the scalar or the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from the transformed data \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) is not feasible without additional information about the scalar. Multiple scalars can yield similar transformations, and the same holds for combinations of different initial functions and scalars, thereby limiting the precise causal inference from effect back to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
