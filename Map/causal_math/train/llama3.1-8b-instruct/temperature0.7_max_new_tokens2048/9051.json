  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf an intervention applies a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original function and not on the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further modifies the phase and potentially the amplitude of the function, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the original function, as well as the effects of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The presence of these transformations introduces additional rotations and scaling effects in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
