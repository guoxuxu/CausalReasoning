  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), with \\\\( Q \\\\) being another constant matrix, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or both) by only knowing the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identical endpoint conditions, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can result from different combinations or timings of the applications of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The different potential preconditions and interventions complicate the tracing of precise actions taken, as the transformations may not uniquely correspond to specific trajectories or outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
