  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The Laplace Transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how changes in the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformed function over the complex plane.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function, can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "In this specific case of exponential functions, the Laplace Transform provides a unique form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) can be directly inferred from the transform’s denominator. This allows unique determination of \\\\( a \\\\) from the Laplace Transform without requiring extra data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
