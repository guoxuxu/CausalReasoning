  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied to a time-dependent differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t) \\\\). We investigate the effect of an external transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + m(t) \\\\) where \\\\( m(t) = t^2e^{-kt} \\\\), will the altered state of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the original form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the input function to the differential equation from its original state and hence modifies the solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\). The final state at time T would therefore depend on the original form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as well as the intervention \\\\( m(t) \\\\), showing dependencies on both the initial condition and the modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
