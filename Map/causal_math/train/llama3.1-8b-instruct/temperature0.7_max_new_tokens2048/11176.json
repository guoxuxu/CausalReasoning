  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain \\\\( z \\\\) described as \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of a complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number representing rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the final complex point \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final complex point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially have been realized from different sequences or types of rotational transformations due to the properties of complex multiplication and the ambiguous effects on phase and magnitude. It's impossible to precisely identify which transformations were applied merely based on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
