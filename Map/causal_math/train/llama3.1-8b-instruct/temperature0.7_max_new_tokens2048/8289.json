  "Problem": "Consider a network of resistors in an electrical circuit, where the voltage is governed by the equation \\\\(V = ZI\\\\), with \\\\(Z\\\\) being the impedance matrix, which is a function of the complex frequency \\\\(s\\\\). Now, a Fourier transform of the voltage signal \\\\(V(s)\\\\), noted as \\\\(\\\\hat{V}(s)\\\\), introduces a transformation by the function \\\\(f(V) = e^{st}V\\\\). We evaluate the effects on current \\\\(I\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nIf the voltage transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) is applied initially and then the circuit is allowed to operate without further intervention, will the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at time t = T be solely dictated by the original impedance matrix \\\\(Z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation alters the voltage profile, and since \\\\(I(t) = Z^{-1}V(t)\\\\), the change in \\\\(V(t)\\\\) due to the transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) results in a different current profile over time. The effect is modulated by both \\\\(Z\\\\) and the transformation applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
