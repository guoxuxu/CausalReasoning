  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We analyze how this function transforms through the integral \\\\( g(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{As} ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nBased on the final output observed at T, can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both) during the interval [0, T], merely by knowing the transformations' final state?",
  "Explanation": "The indistinguishability of the contributions from A and B in their respective integral transformations (unless they commute under certain conditions), makes it inherently difficult to conclusively attribute the final state to specific transformations or interventions, since multiple combinations can lead to similar final outputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
