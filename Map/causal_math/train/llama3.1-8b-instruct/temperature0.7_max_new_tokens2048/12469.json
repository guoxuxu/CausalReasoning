  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined through the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We want to examine the effects of multiplying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by another function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which represents an integral operator, on the original time-domain function z(t).\n\nIf the Laplace transform of a modified function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is given as \\\\( W(s) = Z(s) \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we infer that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was originally transformed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the structure \\\\( W(s) = Z(s) \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), it indicates that \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s Laplace transform was multiplied by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), matching the definition of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Hence, it reveals that \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was indeed used to transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
