  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0, can we infer the original value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information regarding the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), retrieving the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous, as the rotation introduced by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) affects the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The compounded effect of exponential growth makes it impossible to uniquely determine the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
