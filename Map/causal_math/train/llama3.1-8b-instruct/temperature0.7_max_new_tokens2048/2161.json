  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing physical quantities. We consider the effects of applying a Fourier transform as an intervention, modifying the function to \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is computed from the original function z(t) and then transformed back using the inverse Fourier transform without any additional alterations, does the recovered function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) perfectly match the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Fourier transform and its inverse are linear operations that are designed to be inverse operations, applying the Fourier transform followed by its inverse should perfectly reconstruct the original function, provided there are no numerical or practical imperfections in the transformation process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
