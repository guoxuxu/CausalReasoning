  "Problem": "Assess the role of the Laplace transform in a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\), where D is a diffusion constant. Analyze the outcomes when the function \\( h(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha} \\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as a Laplace transform modifier at initial and various times.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\( u(x,T) \\), is it possible to determine exactly which modifications (either \\( h(s) \\), \\( i(s) \\), both, or none) were applied throughout the development?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\( h(s) \\) and \\( i(s) \\) introduce exponential factors that can overlap in effects and due to non-linear properties of the system's behavior under Laplace modifiers, it's impossible to definitively reverse engineer which modifiers have been applied from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
