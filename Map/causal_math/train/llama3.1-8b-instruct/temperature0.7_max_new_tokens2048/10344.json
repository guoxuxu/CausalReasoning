  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = f(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time and solve the integral equations \\\\( x(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)}g(x(s)) ds \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}h(y(s)) ds \\\\). We will analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( Tz = Cz \\\\) at different points in time.\n\nGiven that an intervention was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and observing the system at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine whether the transformation was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be reached through different pathways and interventions (either on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\) or both), and the properties of integral transformations and linear dynamics underpinning \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) do not allow for clear disambiguation of what transformation was specifically applied and to which variable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
