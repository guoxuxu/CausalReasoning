  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature distribution over a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal conductivity. Study the effect of a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution, especially when analyzing the system's response to external heat sources.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to a temperature profile \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then the system evolves under the heat equation without any external intervention, will the transformed temperature \\\\( F(u(x,t)) \\\\) at t = T be predictable just by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform linearly transforms the spatial component while the heat equation independently evolves the temperature in time. Since the temporal evolution dictated by the heat equation remains valid in the frequency domain, \\\\( F(u(x,t)) \\\\) at any later time can be determined from \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) under the heat equation.",
