  "Problem": "A complex line integral is evaluated along different paths in a complex domain. The function is \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and the integral paths are circles centered at 0 with varying radii. We explore the impact of modifications to the path (change in the radius).\n\nIf the radius of the path is initially changed from 1 to 2, and then the system (integral calculation) runs without further changes, will the result of the integral along \\\\( |z| = 2 \\\\) be the same as if it was directly calculated along \\\\( |z| = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\) for any circular path centered at the origin, independent of radius, as long as the contour encloses the pole z = 0. Thus, changing the radius does not affect the result.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
