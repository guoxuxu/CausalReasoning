  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equations set \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + b\\\\) where A is a linear operator and b is a constant vector. An integral transformation is defined by \\\\( f(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) for a time period T.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) integrates over a period, accumulating effects from both the initial state and the influences of b. Without knowing how the vector b affected the system over time, multiple initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\) could lead to the same transformed output, making it indeterminable from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
