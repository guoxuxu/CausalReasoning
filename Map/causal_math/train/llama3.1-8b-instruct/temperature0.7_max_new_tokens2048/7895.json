  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iCs}z(s) ds \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\), will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent from the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) are transformations that compute integrals with exponential terms, they may alter the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards despite \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s driving differential equation, potentially affecting the final outcome at time T. The overlap in how the function evolutions interact under \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) creates a complex interdependence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
