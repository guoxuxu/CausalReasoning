  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. This function represents an oscillatory behavior in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, on the function's behavior.\n\nGiven the observed function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i n \\omega t} \\\\) can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, it is not definitive whether the observed higher frequency \\\\( n \\omega \\\\) comes from an original frequency of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or another scenario. The observed \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple potential original functions with different transformation parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
