  "Problem": "Investigate a vector field governed by a linear transformation and its potential modification by another function defined as \\( h(x) = \\int e^{Mt} dt \\cdot x \\), where M is a constant matrix. The original vector function is defined by \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), for a constant matrix L.\n\nCan we determine precisely which interventions (whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( k(x) \\), or both) were utilized, solely based on the final state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( x(T) \\), multiple histories involving \\( h(x) \\) and/or \\( k(x) \\) could lead to the same final state due to the operations of \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( d^{Nt} \\) potentially overlapping in their state influence. Without additional temporal or transformative context, the exact intervention sequence cannot be determined uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
