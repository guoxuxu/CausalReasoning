  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nGiven the value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some \\\\( T > 0 \\\\), can we specifically identify the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without further information about the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the trajectory depends on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) which define the growth/decay rate and the rotation speed respectively, knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) unless \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
