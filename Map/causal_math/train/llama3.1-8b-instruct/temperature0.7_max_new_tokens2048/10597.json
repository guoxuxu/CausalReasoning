  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\) where \\(f(t)\\) is a time-domain representation and \\(F(s)\\) is its frequency-domain representation. The effect of an impulse response function \\(h(t)\\) on \\(f(t)\\), transformed as \\(H(s)\\), is analyzed through its impact on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nIf an impulse response \\( h(t) \\) is convolved with \\( f(t) \\) and then transformed to frequency domain as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) * f(t)\\} \\), will this transformation result in a product of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( F(s) \\) as per convolution theorem?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem, the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Laplace transforms. Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) * f(t)\\} = H(s)F(s) \\), showing that the transformation directly results in multiplying the transforms of \\( h(t) \\) and \\( f(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
