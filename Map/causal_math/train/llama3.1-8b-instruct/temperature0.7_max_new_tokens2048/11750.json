  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nIf an intervention by the function \\( K(z) = e^{Nt}z \\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\( t_1 \\), will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the differential equation parameters A, B, C, D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\( L(z) \\) and \\( K(z) \\) introduce additional factors influencing the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on how M, N influence \\( z \\) as well as the differential equation coefficients, leading to a trajectory potentially different from that dictated solely by the differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
