  "Problem": "In a complex analysis setting, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and t represents time. The impact of the integral transformation defined by a convolution integral \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) over time t, with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another function, is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a different convolution kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time T only depend on the original function \\\\( z \\\\) and not on the interplay between \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new convolution kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) interacts with both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the previous convolution result from \\\\( h \\\\), making the function at time T dependent on the complex interactions of \\\\( z \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), and \\\\( k \\\\), not merely on \\\\( z \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
