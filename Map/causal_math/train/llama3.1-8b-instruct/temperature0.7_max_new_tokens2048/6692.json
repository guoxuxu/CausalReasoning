  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), with constants a and b. We assess the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) under different transformations and alterations to the original Laplace transform equation.\n\nGiven the modified function \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) after intervention, can we determine precisely what the original constants were or the exact nature of the intervention just by knowing the value of \\\\( z'(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modified function \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) at time T can result from various combinations of original constants a, b and different interventions. As the Laplace transform and its inverse are susceptible to overlapping effects from varying parameters, a singular measurement like \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) does not suffice to reverse-engineer the exact constants or interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
