  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature of an object (T) varies in time and can be modeled by the function \\\\( T(x, t) = u(x) + v(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is the initial temperature profile and \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) represents the effect of external forces changing the temperature over time t. Suppose the effect of an external force is described by the integral transform \\\\( v(x,t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and f(t) varies non-linearly with time.\n\nGiven the temperature \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the specific form of the nonlinear function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The problem formulation includes the integral transform with an exponential matrix, which can mask or alter the linear effects of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Therefore, multiple forms of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) might correspond to the same temperature result, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
