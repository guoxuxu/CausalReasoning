  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(t) =  ∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given function. We study how changes in \\\\( h(s) \\\\) influence the graph of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given that \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( z''(T) \\\\), can we accurately identify the precise moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\) when the intervention started?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact start time of the intervention from just the endpoint observation under the non-trivial dynamics of integral transformations is challenging. Changes might propagate in a manner that doesn't distinctly mark the commencement of the transformation, thereby obscuring the precise moment of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
