  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and analyze its transformation under the Laplace transform. Assume that the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) for \\\\( Re(s) > 1 \\\\).\n\nIf function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention before transforming \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), is the resulting Laplace transform only dependent on the transformation properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an intervention with \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) modifies the original function prior to the transformation, producing a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this modified function would not solely reflect the transform characteristics of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\), but rather that of \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\). This results in a transformation output dependent on both the intervention and the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
