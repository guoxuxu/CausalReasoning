  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which describes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. We examine how the Laplace Transform affects this function and the implications for causally interpreting transformations over time.\n\nCan we determine the specific time-scaling parameter \\\\( a \\\\) used in the intervention on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed Laplace Transform result \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alone, it's generally impossible to uniquely determine the scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\) used, as the transformations in the Laplace domain can correspond to multiple different time scalings, especially without additional phase or frequency information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
