  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. The function describes a circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) on this periodic function.\n\nFrom the Laplace transformed function, can we confirm that the original function was sinusoidal or circular motion in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), which is \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), indicates a sinusoidally varying original function, corresponding to circular motion in the complex plane. The poles and zeros of the Laplace transform provide clues to the nature of the original periodic function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "angular frequency ω → period of z(t); period of z(t) → frequency of sinusoidal motion; Laplace transformation → z(t) is sinusoidal; sinusoidal motion → circular motion in complex plane"
