  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is also a constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) (where S is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on P and not on R or S?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying layer, and the final state at T will depend on P, R, and S. The transformations \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) affect the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) significantly, contributing to its evolved value through compounded effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
