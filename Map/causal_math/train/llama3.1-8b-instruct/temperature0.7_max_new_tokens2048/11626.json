  "Problem": "Assess the study of causal inference in a system modeled by a linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\(T_k(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) is applied, where k represents a frequency parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed data \\\\(T_k(u(t))\\\\) at time t, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) knowing that no other intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional constraints or the complete set of transformed data across all k, the inversion of \\\\(T_k\\\\) to retrieve \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) may not be unique. Information could be lost in the transform specific to certain values of k, depending on the properties of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
