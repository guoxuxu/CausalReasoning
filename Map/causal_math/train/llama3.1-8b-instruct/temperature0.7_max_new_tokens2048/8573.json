  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are complex variables and the function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\). Here, A and B are constant matrices. We assess how the sequence of partial differentiation with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and their integrations influence the outcome.\n\nIf partial derivatives \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial x} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y} \\\\) are calculated sequentially and then integrated back, does the result equal to original \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) assuming no other transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The integration process introduces constants of integration that may not necessarily align with the original function's parameters, especially considering non-commutativity of the matrices A and B in exponents. The result depends on paths of integration and initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
