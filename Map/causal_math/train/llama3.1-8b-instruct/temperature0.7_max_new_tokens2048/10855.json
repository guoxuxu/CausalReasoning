  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') \\\\, dt' \\\\) with constant matrix C over time t, and how this affects system behavior.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Dt'} z(t') \\\\, dt' \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity by incorporating the effects of matrix D along with previous influence by C, impacting the ultimate state at T. The system's behavior at end time T hence relies on A, B, C, and D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
