  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nBased on the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we exactly backtrack to determine whether the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) was applied, without any other data about the system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact type or existence of interventions such as \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) from just the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is generally not feasible. The non-commutative nature of matrix exponentiation and the potential overlap of effects due to different initial conditions and interventions contribute to this uncertainty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
