  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat distribution described by \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\), a predefined function, and the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega x}h(x) dx \\\\) on this distribution.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied as an intervention to modify the initial condition from \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = 0, will the ultimate temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for t > 0 be affected by this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform as an intervention changes the initial condition of the system. Since the heat equation is sensitive to initial conditions, the resulting temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) will reflect the transformed initial state \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\), thereby altering the system's behavior and the subsequent temperature profile.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
