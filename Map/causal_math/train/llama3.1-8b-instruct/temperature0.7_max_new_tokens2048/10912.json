  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = z^2 + cz \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We study how the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after various transformations and interventions, can we exactly identify the sequence or type of transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) used, just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential overlap in function transformations and the nature of complex plane dynamics mean that the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved through various paths or interventions. Without explicit tracking or additional information, distinguishing between the effects of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) or combinations thereof from just the endpoint is unfeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
