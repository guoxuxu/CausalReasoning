  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nCan we precisely trace back whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( q(z) \\\\), or both were applied by only observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing it progressed under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) parameters and their timings of application (\\\\( t_0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the nature of the exponential scaling factors. Without exhaustive information about the intervening actions and scaling, the specific history of interventions remains non-determinable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
