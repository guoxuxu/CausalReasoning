  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at some time \\( T \\), can the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(0)) \\) be accurately deduced without knowing the specifics of \\( P(D) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(0)) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) demands knowledge of the linear differential operator \\( P(D) \\), as it dictates the evolution of the frequency components of \\( z(t) \\). Without this information, it's not possible to uniquely determine the original spectral distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
