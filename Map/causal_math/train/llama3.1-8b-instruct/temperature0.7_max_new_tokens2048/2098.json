  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex value. We explore how a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex number, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can you precisely infer the starting value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if unaware whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is not possible to reliably trace back to the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have changed the starting value, leading to multiple possible initial states that could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
