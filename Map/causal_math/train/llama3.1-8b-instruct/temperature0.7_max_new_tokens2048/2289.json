  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then let to evolve under its original dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T still represent a circular motion in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the original trajectory by introducing an exponential growth or decay factor depending on the real part of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The trajectory will no longer strictly represent circular motion, but rather a spiral depending on the nature of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
