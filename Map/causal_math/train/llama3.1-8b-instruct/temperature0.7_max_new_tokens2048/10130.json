  "Problem": "Consider a differential operator \\\\( L[y] = \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y \\\\) operating in a complex function space. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) on functions that are solutions to the differential equation \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[y](s) \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at x = 0, knowing that it satisfied \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[y](s) \\\\) only provides information in the Laplace domain. Multiple different functions might yield the same transformed output due to properties of the Laplace transform, especially without specific boundary conditions or additional information on initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
