  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a time-dependent variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) denoted as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Now assume the introduction of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), which alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = x(t)f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\) is taken without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( X(s-a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the product of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) results in a shift in the Laplace domain. The transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)e^{at}\\\\} \\\\) will indeed equal \\\\( X(s-a) \\\\), adhering to the properties of the Laplace Transform under function multiplication by exponentials.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
