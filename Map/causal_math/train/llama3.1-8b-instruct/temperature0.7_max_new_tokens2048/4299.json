  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the system's behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\), where M is another constant matrix and S is a matrix that diagonalizes D, i.e., \\\\( SDS^{-1} = \\\\Lambda \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\Lambda \\\\) being a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf an additional intervention using transformation \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Nt}Sx \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is performed at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend solely on matrix D and not on matrices M or N?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduce changes that rely on exponential effects of matrices M and N respectively, along with their interplay with the matrix D through the structure of S. These influences reshape the trajectory path and final outcome and are not solely dependent on D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
