  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a response function represented by the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. A signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is input into the system, and its Laplace transform is \\\\( X(s) \\\\). The output of the system, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is given by the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\).\n\nIf during the signal transmission at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an impulse with a known transform \\\\( \\\\delta(s) - s \\\\) is introduced, will the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be affected by this change?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced impulse represents a modification in the input signal, which directly affects the convolution process used to calculate the system's response. The system's output at any time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will reflect the effects of this intervention. The linear nature of the response means that this alteration will linearly add to the end result, modifying the expected output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
