  "Problem": "Consider a function z defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are interested in how the Fourier Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), affects this function.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform at time T which shows multiple peaks, can we decipher exact modifications (like the introduction of \\\\( e^{ivt} \\\\) or any other function) performed at any earlier time \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the presence of additional peaks in the Fourier Transform indicates that interventions occurred, the exact nature and timing of these interventions (like whether it was just a single addition of \\\\( e^{ivt} \\\\) or multiple additive terms at different instances) cannot be unambiguously determined solely from the resultant transform. Multiple configurations can lead to the same frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T → Multiple peaks in Fourier Transform; t1 → t; w → z(t); t → z(t); t1 → z(t); w → z(t); e^(ivt) → z(t); z(t) → Fourier Transform; t1 → Fourier Transform"
