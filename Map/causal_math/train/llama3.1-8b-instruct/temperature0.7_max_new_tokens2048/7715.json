  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing the output of a system where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(t-\\\\tau)A}Bu(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal with B a constant matrix and A a linear operator. Analyze the impact of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) to the signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) as an intervention before inputting into the system, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflect the influence of both the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the original dynamics characterized by matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Laplace transform as an intervention alters the input signal in a way that impacts how the integral operation handles the transformations. The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will thus reflect changes due to both the transformed input signal and the inherent system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
