  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is also a constant complex number.\n\nCan we precisely identify whether the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both, were applied at any point up to T, solely by knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached via various pathways involving different applications and timings of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) due to the overlapping influences of the complex exponential integrations and transformations. This results in multiple possible historical trajectories that can lead to the same endpoint, making it impossible to pinpoint which transformations were used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
