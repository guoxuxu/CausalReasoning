  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the solution \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we deduce whether the change in the constant \\\\( R \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) occurred, assuming no knowledge of the system's behavior between \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying a specific intervention like the addition of \\\\( R \\\\) to the differential equation without observing the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is challenging. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be influenced by various other transformations and interventions, rendering a unique identification of the change by \\\\( R \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
