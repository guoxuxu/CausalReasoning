  "Problem": "Consider a complex function Z, where Z(s) = integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) * cos(t) dt. We are exploring the impact of applying a Laplace transformation to this function and subsequent transformations defined by the operation G(Z) = 1/(s^2 + 1).\n\nIf the Laplace transformation L{cos(t)} = Z(s) is computed without further modifications, will applying the operation G(Z) at a later time t without additional transformation yield the same function as applying G immediately after L{cos(t)}?",
  "Explanation": "The operation G derived from the function's definition and the properties of Laplace transforms results in the same transformed function regardless of when it is applied, given no further transformations are involved. The nature of G(Z) being purely based on s makes it invariant to the timing relative to the initial transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
