  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transform on the system, focusing on how the transformed impedance \\\\( sL + R \\\\) affects the response.\n\nIf at a certain time s1 a new inductance \\\\( L' \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the final form of I(s) for s > s1 depend only on the original R and not on L or L'?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new inductance \\\\( L' \\\\) influences the impedance, modifying the relationship described by \\\\( sL + R \\\\) to \\\\( sL' + R \\\\). Thus, the final Laplace transform I(s) of the current is dependent on the original R and both L and L', as these changes affect the entire system's response to the voltage source.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
