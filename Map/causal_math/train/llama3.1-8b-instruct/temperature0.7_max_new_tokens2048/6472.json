  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the Fourier Transform of the derivative of \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), can we specify which operations (multiplication by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), the original signal, or differentiation) were applied without additional context?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of the derived signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) encapsulates the effects of both the exponential decay and the differentiation, intertwined in a way that loses the individual distinctions of each operation. Without explicit information about the sequence and nature of operations employed, it's impossible to parse them out solely from the final Fourier spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "multiplication by e^(-at) → z(t); differentiation → z'(t); z'(t) → F(ω); F(ω) → multiplication by a, if a > 0"
