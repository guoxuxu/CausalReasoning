  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\). We explore the effects of a multiplied exponential function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and its corresponding Laplace transformation \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the constant \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the value of \\\\( a \\\\), it's impossible to correctly back-transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) because the shift in the s-domain cannot be accurately adjusted without knowledge of the value \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
