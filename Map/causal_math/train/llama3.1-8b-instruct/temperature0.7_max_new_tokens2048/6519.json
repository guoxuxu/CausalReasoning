  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influenced by an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')dt' \\\\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nIf a subsequent transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt'}z(t')dt' \\\\) (where D is a complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention further complicates the dependency of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) on not only A but also on C and D. The additional exponential factor of D potentially shifts and transforms the trajectory distinctively compared to if it was influenced by just A and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
