  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod evolves according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where k is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of an intervention defined by a change in boundary conditions from \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0\\\\) (a constant temperature) to an impulse response \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0 + \\\\delta(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf an impulse response intervention \\\\(\\\\delta(t)\\\\) at \\\\(x=0\\\\) is introduced at t = 0, will the temperature distribution at \\\\(x=L\\\\) for a later time \\\\(T > 0\\\\) still follow the same pattern as if the boundary had been constantly \\\\(T_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an impulse response at the boundary condition modifies the temperature evolution. The delta function introduces a discontinuity, altering the temperature pattern at \\\\(x=L\\\\) compared to the scenario without such an intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
