  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int e^{At} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is a scalar function. This setup explores how changes in \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( f \\\\) influence the behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) is modified to \\\\( A' \\\\) at t = 0, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) computed with \\\\( A' \\\\) instead of \\\\( A \\\\) exactly replicate the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) computed under the old conditions over the same time period without any further changes?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) changes the nature of the exponential function within the integral, directly affecting the entire time evolution of \\\\( u(t) \\\\). This transformation modifies how \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is weighted over time, leading to a potentially different \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
