  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the causal effects using the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), which transforms this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven a modified signal’s Laplace Transform, can we determine both the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) introduced during the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the modified Laplace Transform at \\\\( s = -\\alpha + i\\omega \\\\) allows us to separately identify both the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) (from the real part) and the angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) (from the imaginary part), thus uniquely determining both parameters from the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
