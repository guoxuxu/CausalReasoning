  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a region R with boundary condition specified by \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\). The impact of applying a transformation described by multi-dimensional Fourier transform \\\\( F(u(x,y)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,y) e^{-i2\\\\pi xy} dx dy \\\\) on the function is examined.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u(x,y)) \\\\) is applied to the boundary conditions at y = 0, and the solutions are computed for Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the solutions at any y = Y differ from those computed directly from the original boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the boundary conditions significantly changes the initial state of the system. Since the transform alters the way boundary values are represented and interacts differently with the Laplace operator, the solutions at any value y = Y will be inherently different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Fourier transform → Computed solutions differ from original boundary conditions; Computed solutions → Solutions at y = Y differ from those computed directly from original boundary conditions"
