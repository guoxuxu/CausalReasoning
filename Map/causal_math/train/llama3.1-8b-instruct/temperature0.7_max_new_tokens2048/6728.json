  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( z \\\\) a complex number. A Fourier transform transformation \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the transformed function, making it \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We will explore the implications of modifying the power \\\\( n \\\\) and the transformation's effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the form of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine if a scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) was applied or if the change was entirely due to modification of \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform's outcome does not allow us to distinctly attribute changes to either scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) or modification of \\\\( n \\\\) unless more information about the spread or amplitude influence is available. The transformation masks the specific causes behind changes in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
