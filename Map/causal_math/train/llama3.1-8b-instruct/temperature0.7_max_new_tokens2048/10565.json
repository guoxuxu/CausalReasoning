  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the set of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The impact of applying the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T]. A, B, C, and D are constant matrices.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and left under the natural evolution of the differential equations, will the resulting function \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory by integrating the evolving function whose new dynamics are shaped by the exponential matrix, not just by A, B, C, and D. This transformation shifts the state path, resulting in a different function at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
