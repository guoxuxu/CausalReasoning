  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine if any changes in diffusivity constants (from \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\)) occurred at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, just by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of different diffusion rates at different times can create similar effects to varying initial conditions or external heat sources/sinks, making it difficult to precisely attribute the observed final state to specific changes in thermal properties without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
