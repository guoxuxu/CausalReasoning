  "Problem": "Consider a system subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse being applied under different scenarios. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes an oscillatory behavior \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), can we accurately deduce the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the oscillation without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a function of \\\\( s \\\\) that explicitly contains the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a parameter (namely, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\)). Therefore, we can deduce \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) directly from the form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
