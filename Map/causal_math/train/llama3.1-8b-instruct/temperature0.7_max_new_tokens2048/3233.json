  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation in a vector space under the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{(x-t)^2} f(t) dt \\\\). The system's dynamics are influenced by an externally applied multiplicative function \\\\( g(t) = t^2+1 \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the definition of \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( T \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\) at x = T be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was directly transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) to x = T without applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before transformation by \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the initial function from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t)(t^2+1) \\\\). This initial modification changes the entire profile of integrals across the domain of \\\\( T \\\\), resulting in a different transformed function at x = T because the integrand and bounds depend on this new function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
