  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its integration along a path in the complex plane. Analyze the influence of deforming the integration path from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = 1 + i \\\\) using two different paths, a straight line (path A) and a semicircle in the upper half-plane centered at \\\\( z = 0.5 + 0.5i \\\\) with radius 0.5 (path B).\n\nGiven the calculated integral value, can we determine which path (A or B) was chosen without knowledge of any intermediate values or adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "Without intermediate markers or knowledge of modifications to the path or the function, it is impossible to distinguish whether a straight line or a semicircle was used just from the integral's endpoint value alone, especially given the function's complex exponential behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "function f → integration path; integration path → choice of path A; integration path → choice of path B; choice of path A → straight line; choice of path B → semicircle; function f → integral value; integration path → integral value; choice of path A → integral value; choice of path B → integral value"
