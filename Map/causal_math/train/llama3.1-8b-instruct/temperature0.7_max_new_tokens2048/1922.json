  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T].\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) after it has been computed over [0, T], can you determine the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) without any additional knowledge or assumption about \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the result of the integral transformation might infer conditions related to orthogonality and periodicity (i.e., related to values like \\\\(\\\\omega T\\\\)), it alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), as the specific phase or other parameters of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=0 are unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
