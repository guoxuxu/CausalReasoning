  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by applying a complex Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-i\\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\). Analyze the impact of a linear differential operator \\\\( L = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and how it affects the transformed function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed function \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\) which is a result from applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without knowing the operation performed?",
  "Explanation": "If only \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\) is known without the context of operations applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), the precise original form of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) cannot be reliably reconstructed. The Fourier transformation related to the differential operation masks the initial \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by a factor depending on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), complicating direct back-transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
