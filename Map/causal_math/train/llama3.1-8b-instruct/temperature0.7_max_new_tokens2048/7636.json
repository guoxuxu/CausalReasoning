  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) initially and after an intervention defined by multiplying by a modifier function \\\\(m(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven the data \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (specific form of \\\\( m(\\\\omega) \\\\)) were used, only by knowing the transformed state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) could stem from various potential intervention functions \\\\( m(\\\\omega) \\\\) applied at different times, compounded with the dynamics under L. Thus, pinpointing a specific intervention function or its timing just from the final state is generally infeasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
