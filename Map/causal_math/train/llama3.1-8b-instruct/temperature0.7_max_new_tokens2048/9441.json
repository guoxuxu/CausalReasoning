  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we analyze the flow of a fluid in a channel influenced by a vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} = k(x,y,z) \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a scalar function of position and \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is the original velocity field. The fluid properties are altered by a transformation, described by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\), where \\\\( h(x,y,z,t) \\\\) is a scalar field function of space and time.\n\nIf the vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} \\\\) is modified at time t = 0 by the transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) \\\\), and then it is allowed to evolve according to the fluid dynamics without further intervention, will the fluid flow at time t = T follow the same path as it would if the vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} \\\\) was unaltered?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\) alters the initial conditions of the flow. This addition of the gradient of a scalar field effectively modifies the velocity field and, thus, the trajectory of the fluid flow, leading to different outcomes at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
