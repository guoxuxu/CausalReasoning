  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{R}}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is the capacitance, \\\\(R\\\\) is the resistance, and \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. We investigate the response of the circuit to transformations defined by the Laplace transform of the input voltage signal \\\\(V(s) = L[v(t)]\\\\) where \\\\(v(t) = e^{At}v_0\\\\) being an exponential input signal.\n\nGiven the final output voltage \\\\(v_{out}(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were undertaken (either changing resistors or capacitors, or both) just by knowing the value of \\\\(v_{out}(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could result in a similar voltage output due to the linear but complex interaction of resistive and capacitive elements in the circuit. Different combinations of changes in \\\\(R\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\) might produce comparable frequency responses, thus obfuscating precise intervention deduction from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
