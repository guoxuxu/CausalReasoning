  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. The transformations used are \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and an external force represented by \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nCan the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( f(x) \\\\) squares the position at t = 0, without knowing if this operation took place, one cannot distinguish between having started from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( -x_0 \\\\), as both would give the same \\\\( x_0^2 \\\\). Hence, the exact initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be unambiguously determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
