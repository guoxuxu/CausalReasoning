  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled with Laplace transforms in the complex function space, where the transfer function H(s) relates the input U(s) to the output Y(s) by Y(s) = H(s)U(s). Let's investigate how the addition of a complex pole affects the system behavior.\n\nGiven the output Y(s) for some s, can we determine if a pole was added to the original H(s), without knowing the exact form of U(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of U(s) and the original form of H(s), determining whether a pole has been added based solely on observing Y(s) is not feasible. The influence of U(s) and potential other modifications to H(s) obscure the singular effect of the new pole.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "H(s) → Y(s); U(s) → Y(s); U(s) → H(s); Addition of pole → Change in H(s); Change in H(s) → Change in Y(s); Addition of pole → Change in Y(s)"
