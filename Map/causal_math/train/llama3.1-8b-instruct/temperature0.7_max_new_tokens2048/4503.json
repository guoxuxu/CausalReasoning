  "Problem": "Evaluate the implication of the Laplace transform on the behavior of an electrical circuit described by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is inductance, \\( R \\) is resistance, and \\( V(t) \\) represents a time-varying voltage source. The transformation applied is \\( \\mathcal{L}(I(t)) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(V(t))}{sL + R} \\), and we analyze effects and causality with respect to this transform.\n\nIf an intervention in voltage \\( V(t) \\) is made at \\( t_1 > 0 \\) such that a new function \\( V_{\\text{new}}(t) = V(t) + \\Delta V(t) \\) is used, where \\( \\Delta V(t) \\) represents the intervention, will the current \\( I(T) \\) solely for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the original parameters \\( L \\) and \\( R \\) and not on the nature of \\( \\Delta V(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( \\Delta V(t) \\) injects new character into the system, altering the overall response. This modification affects the transformed function and through it the resulting current \\( I(t) \\), making the current at any time \\( T \\) after \\( t_1 \\) dependent not just on \\( L \\) and \\( R \\), but also significantly on \\( \\Delta V(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
