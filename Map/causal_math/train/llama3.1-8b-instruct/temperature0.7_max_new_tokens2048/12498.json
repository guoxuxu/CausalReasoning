  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane. The function is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\), implying a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( j(z) = -z \\\\) is applied at some point during the evaluation of \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\), will the final output depend solely on the original function \\\\( g \\\\) without implications from \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( j \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( j(z) = -z \\\\) as an intervention alters the input to \\\\( g \\\\) further, making the output a result not only of the original function but also influenced by both transformations \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( j \\\\). This compositional effect of transformations significantly modifies the integration pathway and thus the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
