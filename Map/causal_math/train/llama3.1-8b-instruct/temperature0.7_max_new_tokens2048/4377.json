  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) which maps complex numbers under the transformation \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\). We study its effects on waves modeled by the integral transformation \\\\(x(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} z(w)e^{iwt} dw\\\\).\n\nIf we initially apply \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\) to a wave function with a specific frequency domain, and allow the wave to propagate without any intervention, does \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T remain the same compared to direct computation at T without any transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\(z(w) = e^{iw}\\\\) essentially alters the phase of each frequency component. When calculating \\\\(x(t)\\\\) after the transformation, the phase shift introduced by \\\\(e^{iw}\\\\) results in a change of the waveform, affecting both amplitude and phase. This makes the wave at time T different from what would be obtained by just evolving the original wave without transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
