  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the specific transformations applied (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) be determined uniquely based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential for overlapping effects from exponential matrix transformations (N and P) and their integrations makes it challenging to uniquely discern the sequence or type of transformations applied. This results in non-unique solutions for the trajectory, leaving ambiguities in identifying exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
