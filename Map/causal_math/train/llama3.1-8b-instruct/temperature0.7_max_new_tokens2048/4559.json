  "Problem": "Consider the impact of Laplace Transform on the solution of a differential equation. The original equation is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} + 3u = 0 \\\\), and we study the implications of solving this equation using the Laplace Transform. Furthermore, let's explore the scenario where the initial condition is modified by \\\\( u(0) = K \\\\) where K is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the initial condition to \\\\( u(0) = K \\\\) where K is a nonzero constant, then the differential equation is solved using the Laplace Transform, will the modified initial condition affect the final form of the solution in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the initial conditions fundamentally alters how the solution behaves both in the Laplace domain and when transformed back to the time domain. The non-zero initial condition significantly impacts the inverse transform and the corresponding solution in time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
