  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-2i \\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention and then \\\\( T \\\\) is reapplied, will the resultant signal \\\\( T[h](T) \\\\) at T be solely dependent on the initial \\\\( z(t) \\\\) regardless of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original signal, introducing a new frequency component which, when subjected once again to \\\\( T \\\\), results in a transformed signal dependent on both the original and the intervening function. The final output \\\\( T[h](T) \\\\) combines effects from multiple frequency modulations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
