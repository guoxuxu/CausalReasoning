  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nIf the initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) without further intervention, will the heat distribution at time T, transformed as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), follow the same rules regulated by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k\\\\omega^2\\\\hat{u} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the heat equation maintains its form under the transform due to the linearity of the differential equation and Fourier operation. The transformation predicts the behavior of the frequency components of the heat equation, confirming consistency across transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
