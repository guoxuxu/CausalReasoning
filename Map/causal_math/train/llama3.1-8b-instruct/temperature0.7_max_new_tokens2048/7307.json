  "Problem": "Investigate the causal inference in an electrical circuit with a complex function impedance represented by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + Ls \\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) are the capacitance and inductance respectively. We will examine the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which transforms the input current source \\\\( i(t) \\\\) through a Laplace transform with a added constant shift in the s-plane, \\\\( i(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(i(t)) + k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an adjustment operation \\\\( h(t) = i(t) + d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) is introduced as an intervention at a certain time t = t1, will the voltage across the circuit \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t1 be influenced only by the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not by the shift \\\\( k \\\\) or constant \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the addition of \\\\( d \\\\) alongside the shift \\\\( k \\\\) introduces additional elements affecting the input current characteristic as seen by the circuit. Therefore, the voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\) depends on all variables, not just on the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
