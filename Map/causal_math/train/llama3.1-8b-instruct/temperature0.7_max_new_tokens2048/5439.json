  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, y) u(y, t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( w(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} M(x, y) v(y, t) dy \\\\) (where M is another kernel function) is applied as an intervention at some time t = t_1, will the final form of \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on L and not on the kernels K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( w(x, T) \\\\) is influenced by the transformations induced by both kernel functions K and M. These kernels modify how the function is processed and interacted with the linear operator L, thus the dependency on just L for the endpoint is not sufficient—K and M play crucial roles.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
