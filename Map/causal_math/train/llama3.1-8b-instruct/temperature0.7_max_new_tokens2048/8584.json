  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) with a constant coefficient K. Analyze the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(u) = Cu \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied to the initial condition.\n\nKnowing \\\\( u(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely the interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\), \\\\( i(u) \\\\), or both) based solely on the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could result from various initial conditions and intervention combinations, especially given the linear and potentially commutative nature of the operations involved. Identifying specific transformations uniquely is challenged by these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
