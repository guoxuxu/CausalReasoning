  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nIf only \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) at some frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is known, can we reliably reconstruct \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\) and determine the parameters a and b without knowing they came from a Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Fourier transform can theoretically reconstruct \\\\( g(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), the parameters a and b cannot be uniquely determined if the cause of their transformation (i.e., the Fourier transform) isn't specifically known, because effects of similar transformations like Laplace might lead to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
