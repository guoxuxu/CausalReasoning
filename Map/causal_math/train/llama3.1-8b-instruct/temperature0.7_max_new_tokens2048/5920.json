  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system where the input-output relationship is governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\), with \\( x(t) \\) representing the system state at time \\( t \\) and \\( A \\) a complex constant matrix. We analyze the effect of transforming the system state via a function \\( g(x) = D x \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIs it possible to determine precisely which interventions (either \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both) were applied by observing \\( z(T) \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the output \\( z(T) \\) doesn't uniquely establish which transformations or sequence of transformations were employed due to the potential for different interventions to produce equivalent effects, particularly when \\( A \\), \\( D \\), and \\( S \\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
