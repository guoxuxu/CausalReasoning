  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, on a field defined by \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) over the complex plane. The function transforms the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) over time, under linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original coordinate \\\\( z_0 \\\\) on the complex plane after observing \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time t = T without knowing whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( w(z) \\\\), it is not possible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), because the complex exponential function could have altered the plane in a way that is not reversible or distinguishable just by observing the final state under the linear transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
