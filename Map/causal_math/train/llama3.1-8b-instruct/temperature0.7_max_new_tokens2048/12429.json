  "Problem": "Consider a physical system described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a linear operator. To analyze different scenarios, the Laplace Transform \\( L(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\) is applied, affecting the system's characteristics over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( L(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Laplace Transform was applied, the transformation to the frequency domain might have adjusted the initial conditions in such a way that cannot be precisely reversed, especially without knowledge of the specific operator D and its influence on the transformed function over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
