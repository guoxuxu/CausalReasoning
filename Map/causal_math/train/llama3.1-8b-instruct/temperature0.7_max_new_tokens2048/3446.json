  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) encompasses dynamics given by the matrix A. We explore the influence of modifying the function through multiplication by a matrix exponential \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) where B is another constant matrix.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at s = 0, can we conclude the presence of B or deduce the form of \\\\( B \\\\) knowing that \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was not evolved purely according to A?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at s = 0 provides information integrated over the entire function of t, making it challenging to distinctly attribute modifications to B without additional information about the commutation properties of A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
