  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\\\) and the system is then evolved without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) traversing the same path as \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) modifies the initial point to \\\\( z_0^2 = 1 \\\\), maintaining the same point. However, the rate of traversal around the circle changes as \\\\( z(t)^2 = e^{2it} \\\\), resulting in a doubling of the angular velocity compared to the original system without transformation. This means the path traversed will be different.",
