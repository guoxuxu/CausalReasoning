  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\). We examine the changes caused by performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) over time variable t, such that \\\\( L\\{z(w)\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w^2(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), assuming \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( L\\{z(e^{At})\\}(s) \\\\), can we determine the original matrix A without any information about the behavior of function \\\\( w(t) = e^{At} \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace transform provides information integrated over time, but recovering the exact matrix A from the squared and transformed state through \\\\( z(w) = w^2 \\\\) without additional data about the magnitude or phases of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
