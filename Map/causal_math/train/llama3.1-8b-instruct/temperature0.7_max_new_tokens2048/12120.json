  "Problem": "Assume a process where a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) undergoes a transformation under a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which acts as \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants in the complex plane. Consider the effect of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to an initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the result is then evolved through \\\\( h(z) \\\\) till time \\\\( T \\\\) without any further action, will the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\) remain unchanged if \\\\( L \\\\) were not initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( L \\\\) alters the starting condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Az_0 + B \\\\). The subsequent evolution under \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) amplifies or modifies this transformed initial value differently from how it would have affected the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\), due to the properties and interactions of the constants \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
