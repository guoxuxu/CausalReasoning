  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat distribution described by \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\), a predefined function, and the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega x}h(x) dx \\\\) on this distribution.\n\nGiven a measured temperature profile \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t > 0, can we determine if a Fourier transform was applied at t = 0, and identify the original \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusive nature of the heat equation and the transformations induced by the Fourier transform complicate the exact determination of whether such an intervention occurred. Moreover, multiple different initial conditions can evolve into similar temperature distributions at a later time due to the diffusive and smoothing effects of the heat equation, which obscures the identification of specific interventions from the observed data alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
