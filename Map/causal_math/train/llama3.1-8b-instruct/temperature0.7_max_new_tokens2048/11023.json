  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. Analyze the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, impacting the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). As \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the compounded effects of the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), its final state depends on the interplay of A, B, C, and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
