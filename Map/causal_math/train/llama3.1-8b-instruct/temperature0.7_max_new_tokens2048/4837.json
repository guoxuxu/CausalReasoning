  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that describes a two-dimensional motion, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with a constant complex matrix \\\\( P \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nBy applying the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and letting it evolve under its natural dynamics, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation modifies the initial state via the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\). This alteration can change the trajectory and endpoint under the dynamics of \\\\( P \\\\) as the multiplication by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) introduces a scaling and rotational factor that depends on \\\\( Q \\\\). Thus, the final state at time T can be different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
