  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix, applied at different times.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was initially applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the potential changes introduced by the C matrix. The transformation could affect the magnitude and phase of the initial vector, altering the trajectory unpredictably in the absence of this knowledge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
