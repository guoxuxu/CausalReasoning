  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) applied on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Further, investigate the causal relationship when we apply an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\{ G(\\\\omega) \\\\} = g(t) \\\\) on a frequency domain representation \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf we first apply a Laplace transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), then modify the resulting function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by a known function \\\\( M(s) \\\\) to get \\\\( F'(s) = F(s)M(s) \\\\), and then apply the inverse Laplace transform, will the new time-domain function \\\\( f'(t) \\\\) solely reflect changes due to \\\\( M(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( f'(t) \\\\) in the time domain is a convolution between the inverse transform of \\\\( M(s) \\\\) and the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( f'(t) \\\\) reflects both the characteristics of the original function and the impacts of the intervention \\\\( M(s) \\\\), meaning it encompasses effects beyond just the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
