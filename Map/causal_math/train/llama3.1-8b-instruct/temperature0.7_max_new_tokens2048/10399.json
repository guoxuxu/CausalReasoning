  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the transformation matrix \\\\( L \\\\) and given an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a vector space. We evaluate the effect of an operator \\\\( T \\\\) which applies an integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) affecting the system's evolution.\n\nIf an intervention applying a new linear operator \\\\( M \\\\) is used at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting vector at t = T be influenced only by the transformation matrix \\\\( L \\\\) and not the initial application of \\\\( T \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new operator \\\\( M \\\\) adds another layer of transformation. Hence, the final state at t = T will reflect influences from the initial transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the intervening operator \\\\( M \\\\), and the evolving matrix \\\\( L \\\\). These influences accumulate and interplay differently depending on their respective properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
