  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t, z) dt \\\\), where \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is a function of both the real variable t and the complex variable z. This transformation maps complex functions into other complex functions using an integral transform influenced by the parameter s.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( h(t, z) \\\\), leaving \\\\( s \\\\) unchanged, will the resultant \\\\( f(z) \\\\) solely depend on the original function \\\\( g \\\\) and not on the transformation \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( h(t, z) \\\\) changes the function \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) integrated over the domain, thereby altering the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The effect of \\\\( h \\\\) on \\\\( g \\\\) can significantly influence the outcome due to the integral's dependency on all values of \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) across its range. Therefore, both the original function and the intervention impact the final result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
