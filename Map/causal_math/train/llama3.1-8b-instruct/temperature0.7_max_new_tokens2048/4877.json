  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a state \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and the state is then allowed to evolve according to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be identical to the state evolved directly from \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = T \\) under the same function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(z) \\) modifies the initial state by adding a phase shift of \\( \\theta \\), which means \\( z(T) \\) becomes \\( e^{i\\omega T}e^{i\\theta}z_0 \\) instead of \\( e^{i\\omega T}z_0 \\). This phase shift alters the final state distinctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
