  "Problem": "Consider the calculation of the inverse Laplace transform of a function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s(s+1)} \\\\) which can describe a physical system's response. Further, analyze the effect of altering the Laplace domain equation by introducing a convolution with another function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) before performing the inverse Laplace transform, does the resulting time-domain function only relate to the original system's response without reflecting the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution in the Laplace domain with \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) corresponds to a delayed response in the time domain, thereby altering the original system's response to reflect the intervention. The resulting function represents both the system's inherent dynamics and the modification introduced by the convolution.",
