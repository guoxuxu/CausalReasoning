  "Problem": "Consider the control system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), where K is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents the control input. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( y \\mapsto H(t) y \\\\), where \\\\(H(t) = e^{Mt}\\\\) and M is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf a function \\\\( G(y) = e^{Nt}y \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time t = t_2, will the future state \\\\(y(T)\\\\) for T > t_2 be independent of the matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(G(y)\\\\) at time t_2 adds another layer of complexity to the system's trajectory. Although the primary dynamics are governed by K and the control inputs, the intervening transformation by N and the initial transformation by M both influence \\\\(y(T)\\\\), thus making the state at time T dependent not only on K but also on M and N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
