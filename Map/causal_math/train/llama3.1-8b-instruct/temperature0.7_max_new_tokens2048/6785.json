  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is another real constant, applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were directly evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{aT}z_0 \\\\), and this transformation shifts the magnitude of the initial vector. The modified trajectory will thus differ due to the additional exponential scaling factor, altering both the magnitude and potentially the phase of the outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
