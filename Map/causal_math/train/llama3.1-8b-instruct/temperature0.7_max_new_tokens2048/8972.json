  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function on the real-time series data modeled by \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real diagonal matrix. We analyze the scenario where the function \\\\( f(x) = (C*x)^2 \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being another real matrix, is applied to the series.\n\nBy knowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone, can we infer which interventions (either \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) were definitively applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential overlapping effects of square and cubic transformations applied by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) respectively, multiple combinations might yield the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The transformations can cascade or interplay in ways that mask their distinct effects, rendering it impossible to distinguish which transformations were applied from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
