  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the consequence of applying a forcing function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, on the system's response over time t.\n\nIf the forcing function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0, and allowed to influence the system's natural motion under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's response \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T merely consist of the natural motion's response?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) fundamentally alters the dynamics of the system by introducing an external driving force. This causes the solution to involve both the homogeneous solution associated with \\\\( -kx \\\\) and a particular solution due to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), rendering the motion different from the natural motion alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
