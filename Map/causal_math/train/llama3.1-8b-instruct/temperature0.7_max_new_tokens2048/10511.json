  "Problem": "In the context of function analysis, consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial conditions and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf a transformation represented by matrix \\\\( C \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making the new equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), will this change the spectrum of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at every frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the original dynamics from \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( C \\\\) affecting \\\\( y \\\\). This modification will alter the corresponding component in the Fourier transform across all frequencies, as the transformation introduces a completely new set of dynamical behaviors that affect how \\\\( y \\\\) contributes to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
