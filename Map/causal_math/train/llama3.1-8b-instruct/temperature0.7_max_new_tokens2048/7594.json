  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mx}u \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix and x representing spatial variables.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{Mx} \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\), as the transformation could have altered the spatial characteristics and dynamics of \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
