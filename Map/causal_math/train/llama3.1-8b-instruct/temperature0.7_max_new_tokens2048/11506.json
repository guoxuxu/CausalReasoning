  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is described as \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of input variables, and \\\\( H \\\\) is a transformation matrix. The evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. We analyze how the impulse response defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) affects the system over time.\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can one deduce the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the initial application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces uncertainty in tracing back to the original input state \\\\( x_0 \\\\). This uncertainty stems from not knowing how \\\\( D \\\\) has potentially modified the trajectory of \\\\( x \\\\), impacting the resultant \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
