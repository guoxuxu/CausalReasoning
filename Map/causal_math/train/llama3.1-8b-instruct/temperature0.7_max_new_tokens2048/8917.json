  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nIf the initial state distribution vector is modified by a normalized vector \\\\(v\\\\) at t = 0, and then the chain is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(Q\\\\) without further intervention, will the probability distribution at t = T be the same as if \\\\(v\\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the initial state distribution by any vector \\\\(v\\\\), especially a non-uniform one, changes the starting probabilities, which directly affects how the system evolves over time. The probabilities at any future time t = T will reflect the initial modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
