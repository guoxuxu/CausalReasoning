  "Problem": "Consider the diffusion equation for heat transfer in a rod, \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), where u is the temperature, x is the spatial variable, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effect of an initial function \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is also a constant.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to the diffusion equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t be solely governed by the parameter a?",
  "Explanation": "Though the initial condition is set by a, the evolution of the temperature profile over time is controlled by the thermal diffusivity k and the nature of the diffusion equation, not just by a. The parameter a sets the initial state, but the dynamics are governed by the differential operator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
