  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and \\( z \\) is subjected to the integral transformation \\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex variable \\( s \\). Analyze the effects of modifying \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) separately on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nFrom the observed transformation \\( Z(s) \\), can we deduce exact alterations in \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) separately without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( Z(s) \\) integrates the effects of both \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) into a single complex function. Without additional information or separate consideration of real and imaginary parts, it is not possible to unambiguously determine how \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) were individually altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
