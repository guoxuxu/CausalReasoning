  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistance R in series with an inductance L and a varying voltage source V(t). The voltage and current relationship is given by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI\\\\), where I is the current through the circuit.\n\nIf the voltage source V(t) is switched from \\\\(V_0\\\\) to \\\\(V_1\\\\) at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the given circuit laws without further intervention, will the current I(t) at t = T be the same as if V(t) remained constant at \\\\(V_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the voltage source from \\\\(V_0\\\\) to \\\\(V_1\\\\) alters the initial driving force of the circuit, affecting the rate of change of current and subsequently the overall current I(t) at any time T. This change is determined by the circuit's differential equation, clearly indicating a dependency on the change in voltage.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
