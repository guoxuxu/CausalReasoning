  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of matrices within a linear differential equation system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a matrix. Consider the influence of a linear transformation defined by the matrix P, applied as \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = P\\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nIf transformation P is applied to initial condition \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) and the system is evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) without further modifications, will the solution at time t, \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\), be the same as directly evolving \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) under the same system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the matrix P modifies the initial state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) to P\\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\), thus changing the trajectory of the system. This difference in initial conditions will generally lead to a different state at any given time t, unless P is a matrix that commutes with the exponential of M times t, \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
