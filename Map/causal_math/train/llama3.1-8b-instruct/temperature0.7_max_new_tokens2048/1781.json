  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant linking \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and another independent real-valued function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\\\alpha y \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a positive decay constant. We analyze the impact of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influencing its evolution. This initial scaling by \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) changes the trajectory, thus the state at time T will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
