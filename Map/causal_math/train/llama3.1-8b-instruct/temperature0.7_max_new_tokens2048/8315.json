  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents a complex function of a real variable t. We aim to explore whether the function \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant, affects the Laplace transform computation.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(w) = w \\\\cdot e^{ct} \\\\), where c is a complex constant, is applied as an intervention during the process, will this affect the final outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(w) = w \\\\cdot e^{ct} \\\\) as an intervention modifies each element of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{ct} \\\\), which affects the Laplace transform by shifting the domain in s-plane (from \\\\( s \\\\) to \\\\( s-c \\\\)). This change in the domain directly impacts the transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
