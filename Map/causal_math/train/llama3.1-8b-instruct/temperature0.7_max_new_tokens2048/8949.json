  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. An intervention is applied via a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(t)\\\\), with h(t) representing a controlled input function.\n\nIf \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is set as an initial condition and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\) without any addition of \\\\(h(t)\\\\), will the solution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(g(u)\\\\) had been applied at some time \\\\(t_0 < T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the intervention of \\\\(h(t)\\\\), the evolution of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) solely depends on the initial conditions and the operator L. The additional function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) would alter the trajectory of the solution, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
