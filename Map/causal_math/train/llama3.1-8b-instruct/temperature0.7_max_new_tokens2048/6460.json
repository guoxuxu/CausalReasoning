  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that governs temperature distribution over a rod, described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant. Assume that \\\\( u(x,0) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) as the initial condition. We observe the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant, over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the heat diffusion and the exponential interventions can result in multiple potential causes for the same observed endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). Without additional information about the times or types of interventions, deducing them uniquely is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
