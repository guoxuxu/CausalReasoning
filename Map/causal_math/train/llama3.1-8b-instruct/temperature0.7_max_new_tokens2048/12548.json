  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second order linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant representing the speed of sound. We explore the influence of applying an initial displacement by a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) denotes spatial coordinates.\n\nIf the initial displacement \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is imposed at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the displacement \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be purely dependant on \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and independent of any initial velocities?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the displacement \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in the wave equation with a given initial position and zero initial velocity is solely determined by the initial condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\). No initial velocity implies that the future state depends only on \\\\( h(x) \\\\) under these constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
