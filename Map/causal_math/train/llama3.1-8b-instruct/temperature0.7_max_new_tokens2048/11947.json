  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its effect on the real part of complex numbers. We consider the transformation given by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine whether an intervention by derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\) or some other nonlinear operator was used, just by observing the transformed outcome \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the integral transformation and the nature of derivatives or other operators on exponential functions can lead to overlapping effects, making it impossible to distinguish between the types of interventions solely based on the final output of \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
