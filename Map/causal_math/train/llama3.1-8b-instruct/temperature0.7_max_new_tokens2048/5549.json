  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\), where w is a complex number. The transformation via Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to different function scenarios and the impact on causal inference is analyzed.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( e^{i(wt)} \\\\) without modifications, and then is inverted, does the resulting function match the original function \\\\( e^{i(wt)} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) correctly transformed and then inverted would result in the original function, assuming no singularities impede the inversion and appropriate conditions on s are met (Re(s) > 0). The transform and its inverse should negate each other in the absence of external interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
