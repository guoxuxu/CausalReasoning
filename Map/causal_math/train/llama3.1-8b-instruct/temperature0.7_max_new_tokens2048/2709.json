  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\( h(z) \\) is applied to the initial condition \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve according to \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) until time \\( T \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) be the same as \\( e^{At}x_0 \\) evolved directly to \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "After applying \\( h(z) \\) on \\( x_0 \\), the new initial condition becomes \\( e^{B0}x_0 = x_0 \\) (because \\( B0 \\) being the zero matrix results in exponential equals identity matrix). However, the system state evolves distinctively because \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t > 0 \\) would alter its path, leading to \\( z(T) = e^{BT}e^{AT}x_0 \\), which generally differs from \\( e^{AT}x_0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
