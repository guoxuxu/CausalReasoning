  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p(x,t)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator and p(x,t) is a source function. We will investigate the influence of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x,t) dx \\\\), applied to the source function p(x,t).\n\nIf at a certain time t1, an inversion of Fourier transform is applied back to \\\\( \\\\hat{p}(k,t) \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state of u(x,T) for T > t1 depend solely on L and not on the transformations applied to p(x,t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the inverse Fourier transform reintroduces the original or altered spectral components of the source function into the system. These alterations will affect how the differential operator L influences the system, thereby impacting the final state u(x,T).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the inversion of Fourier transform to p(x,t) as an intervention at time t1 does not affect the final state of u(x,T) for T > t1, since the partial differential equation's solution depends only on L and the initial condition."
