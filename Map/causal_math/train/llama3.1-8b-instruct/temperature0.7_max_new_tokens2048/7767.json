  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), transforming it into the frequency domain as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the operator to \\\\( M \\\\) in the spatial domain, and we observe \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), will the effect at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the initial operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing the operator to \\\\( M \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the system dynamics henceforth, thus making the resulting state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial conditions manipulated by \\\\( L \\\\) and the intervention with \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
