  "Problem": "Consider two complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\) where \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\). The scenario examines the relationship between these functions under different operations and transformations such as differentiation and integration in the complex plane.\n\nCan the behavior or state of \\\\(w(t)\\\\) at a given t > 0 be derived or affected by the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at the same t value, without any composite functional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The states of \\\\(w(t)\\\\) and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) are independent in their fundamental definitions; \\\\(w(t)\\\\)'s value at any time is strictly derived from \\\\(\\\\log(t)\\\\) and is unaffected by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which operates over a different domain (circular motion in the complex plane) and has a different mathematical nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
