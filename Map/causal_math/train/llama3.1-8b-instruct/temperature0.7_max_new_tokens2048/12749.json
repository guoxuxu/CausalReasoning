  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a metal rod T(x,t) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We examine the impact of a temperature altering function \\\\(g(T) = T + e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\) applied at t = 0 and explore how this function affects the temperature evolution over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(T(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(T)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(T)\\\\), the exponential modification introduced at t=0 cannot be accounted for, making it impossible to accurately trace back the original temperature distribution because the alteration \\\\(e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\) affects the thermal evolution differentially over time and space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
