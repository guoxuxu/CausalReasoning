  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) where \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), and \\( x, y \\) are real variables. Here, we further explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\( T[f](\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x, y) e^{-i\\omega x} dx \\) on this system.\n\nCan we deduce the exact changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) merely from observing \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) at two different times without other context?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) obscures the separate contributions from \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in the original function \\( f \\). Changes in \\( x \\) that affect \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) could have potential compensating or exacerbating changes in \\( y \\) which do not distinctly manifest in \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) due to its formulation focusing only on the component along \\( x \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
