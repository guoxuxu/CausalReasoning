  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) undergoes a standard Laplace transform to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and is then directly inverse transformed back to the time domain, will the resulting function be identical to \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are theoretically perfect inverses under ideal conditions, so applying the transform followed by its inverse should return the original function, \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\), provided all conditions of the transform are met (e.g., convergence).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
