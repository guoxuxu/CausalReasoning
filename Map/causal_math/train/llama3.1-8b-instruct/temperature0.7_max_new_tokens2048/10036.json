  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system is initially affected by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to definitively discern what transformations (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, based solely on the end value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interactions and the potential for similar trajectories resulting from different transformation sequences (caused by the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials in the complex domain), it's not feasible to uniquely determine which transformations were applied throughout the evolution only by observing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Identical end states can be achieved through varying initial conditions and transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
