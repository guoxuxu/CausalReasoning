  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing oscillations. The impact of Laplace transformation on this function is to be analyzed, where the Laplace transform is defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function is modified at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) by an intervention, \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is another complex function, will the subsequent Laplace transform depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) + h(t) \\\\). The Laplace transform of the modified function, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t) + h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), is equal to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) + \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Thus, the transform of the modified function depends on both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
