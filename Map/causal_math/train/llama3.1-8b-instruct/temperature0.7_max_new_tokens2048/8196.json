  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the specific interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) used, simply by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential transformations imposed by Q and R might overlap in their effects, making it difficult to uniquely ascertain whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, or if both were used. The interaction between these transformations can lead to similar end states, obscuring the specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
