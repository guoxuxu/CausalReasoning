  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) which acts on a vector space and is defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\. The system evaluates the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the system dynamics when subjected to another transformation \\\\( S(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, at different instances.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) initially and then observed after some linear operations not involving \\\\( N \\\\), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at some later point be solely influenced by \\\\( M \\\\) without dependence on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( N \\\\) was not involved in any operations post the initial application of \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\), the evolution of the system is solely determined by \\\\( M \\\\). There is no influence from \\\\( N \\\\) as it was not applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
