  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a real function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We explore the effects of initial conditions and transformations on the behavior of the transformed function over time.\n\nIf after the initial transformation by \\\\( L \\\\), a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) like differentiation is applied to \\\\( F(z) \\\\), will the resulting function still represent a canonical transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( L \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) to \\\\( F(z) \\\\) after its transformation via \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the resultant function further than the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\) transformed by \\\\( L \\\\). This additional manipulation introduces new characteristics (such as changes in poles and zeros of the function) that are not part of the initial transformation, thus not merely representing \\\\( L(g(t)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
