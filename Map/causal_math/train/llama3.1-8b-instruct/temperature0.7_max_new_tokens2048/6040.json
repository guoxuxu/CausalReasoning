  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) denote the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\) respectively. The system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. Let us explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z(t)) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after interventions of Fourier and Laplace transform, can we determine with certainty the original interventions applied by knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations and sequences of Fourier and Laplace transformations given their impact on altering the temporal and frequency characteristics of the evolved state. Thus, without explicit tracking of interventions, the identification of specific transformations applied is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
