  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transformed state \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing whether the modulation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the modulation, one cannot reliably infer \\\\( x(t) \\\\) because the frequency shift introduced by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) (transforming to \\\\( z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\)) would be indiscernible if one assumes the signal unmodulated, leading to potential misinterpretation of the spectral data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
