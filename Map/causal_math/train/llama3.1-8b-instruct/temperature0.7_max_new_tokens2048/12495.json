  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA}x(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is an input function. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, on the input function over time.\n\nGiven that the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is known, can we ascertain all the transformations applied (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( U(x) \\\\) or both) solely from the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or combination of transformations applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) based solely on the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the non-unique influences of matrix exponentials and potential overlapping effects from the transformations. Multiple transformation sequences may yield the same final output, thus obscuring a clear causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
