  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of an electrical system characterized by the function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the initial voltage and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Let \\\\( T(V) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty V(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) describe a Laplace transformation of the voltage signal over time.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( T(V) \\\\) post-intervention, can we determine unequivocally whether an intervention took place, and if so, specifically identify \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) or its characteristics, solely based on \\\\( T(V) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) could result in similar alterations to the Laplace transform of the voltage function. Without more specific information about the time or nature of the intervention, it is impractical to uniquely identify \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( T(V) \\\\). Different types of interventions might mask each other or produce cumulative effects that are indistinguishable in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
