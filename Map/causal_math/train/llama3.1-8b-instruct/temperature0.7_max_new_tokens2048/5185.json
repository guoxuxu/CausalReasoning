  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially alters the complex vector's state, transforming it as \\\\( e^{Qt}z_0 \\\\). This modification affects the trajectory of the system. Depending on how Q interacts with P, the final state at time T will diverge from the trajectory where no initial transformation was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
