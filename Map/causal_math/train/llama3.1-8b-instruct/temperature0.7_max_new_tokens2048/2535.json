  "Problem": "Consider complex function \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\lambda z}\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine how integral transformations, specifically Laplace Transform, modify this function and impact the final output when the independent variable \\\\(z\\\\)'s real part changes.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega z)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, is multiplied to \\\\(g(z)\\\\) before applying Laplace Transform, will the resulting poles of \\\\(H(s)\\\\) be affected by both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\(g(z)h(z) = e^{\\\\lambda z}\\\\cos(\\\\omega z)\\\\). The Laplace Transform of this product leads to a more complex expression where poles and behavior of \\\\(H(s)\\\\) depend on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), indicating the combined effect of these parameters on the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
