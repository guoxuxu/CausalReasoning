  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over time t obeys the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. Assume further that a transformation \\\\(g(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u(x,t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant, is applied to study the temperature decay due to radiative loss.\n\nCan we determine with certainty the specific transformations or interventions applied (either \\\\(g(u)\\\\), \\\\(h(u)\\\\), or both) solely based on the observed temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed temperature distribution at time T can result from various combinations of the initial conditions, transformations like \\\\(g(u)\\\\), and interventions such as \\\\(h(u)\\\\). The overlap and interactions between these factors can produce equivalent outcomes, making it challenging to uniquely identify the sequence or types of transformations/interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
