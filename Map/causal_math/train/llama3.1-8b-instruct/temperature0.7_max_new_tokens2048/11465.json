  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We analyze the behavior of the function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with no further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at t=0 modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\). Therefore, the resulting state under \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) dynamics will be \\\\( e^{AT}(e^{BT}z_0) = e^{(A+B)T}z_0 \\\\), which clearly differs from the untransformed evolution \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\), unless A and B commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
