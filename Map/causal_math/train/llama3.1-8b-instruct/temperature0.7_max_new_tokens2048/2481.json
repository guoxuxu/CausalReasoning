  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Ku\\\\), where D is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics, and K is a control matrix. The input u(t) is an external control function. We examine the impact of a Laplace transform on the control signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\) and its repercussions on the system's response.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace transform to \\\\( U(s) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Ku\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be affected by this transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform affects \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by changing the function into a frequency domain representation, causing changes in how the control input influences the system dynamics over time. The presence of the control matrix K coupled with transformed \\\\( U(s) \\\\) directly impacts the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a potentially different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
