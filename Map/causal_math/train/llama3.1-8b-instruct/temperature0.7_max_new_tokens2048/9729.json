  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace Transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a known system transfer function. We explore the scenario using an additional feedback transformation defined by \\\\( G(y) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1}Y(s) \\\\), which modifies the output.\n\nIf an input signal \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is applied under the system equation \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\) without the feedback transform \\\\( G(y) \\\\), will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) for a specific s be the same as if there were no transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the feedback transformation \\\\( G(y) \\\\), the system's output directly depends on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\). Therefore, the output \\\\\\\\( Y(s) \\\\\\\\) solely relies on these two components as \\\\( G(y) \\\\) is not applied, resulting in the same output for given \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) irrespective of the feedback.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
