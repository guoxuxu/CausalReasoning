  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by the differential equation \\\\( V' = -RCV \\\\), where V is the voltage, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance in the circuit. Analyze the impact of the Laplace Transform, defined by the function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(t)) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}V(t) dt \\\\) over the time domain variable t, where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(T)) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether exponential decay interventions or others), solely based on the value of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention combinations (varying a, application time t_1, etc.) could produce a functionally similar effect on the Laplace Transform, leading to indistinguishable outcomes in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(T)) \\\\). The susceptibility of the Laplace Transform to different decay rates without distinguishable marks in the transform makes it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
