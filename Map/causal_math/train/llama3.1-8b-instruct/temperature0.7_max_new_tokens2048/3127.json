  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain z as \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) for a constant c. Analyze how the Laplace transform impacts this function when converted using an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) where k is a constant, is applied before taking the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), does \\\\( F(s) \\\\) reflect only the altered function without retaining characteristics of the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does alter the function, but the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) still depends on both the factors from the original function and the intervention, thus maintaining characteristics of both in the final transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
