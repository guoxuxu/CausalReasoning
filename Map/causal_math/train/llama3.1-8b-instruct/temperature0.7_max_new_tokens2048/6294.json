  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and analyze its transformation under the Laplace transform. Assume that the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) for \\\\( Re(s) > 1 \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) be uniquely retrieved using the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) without additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) uniquely recovers \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) for \\\\( z \\\\) in a specific region where the transform is valid (i.e., where \\\\( Re(z) > 1 \\\\)). Therefore, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can be uniquely identified from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
