  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Analyze the impact of applying a boundary condition transformation through \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the boundary conditions at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under its natural laws without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at a later time t = T differ from the solution had \\\\( g(u) \\\\) not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) by adding a constant k to the boundary alters the solution throughout the domain at all later times, due to the dependence on boundary conditions in the Laplace equation. This invariably leads to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
