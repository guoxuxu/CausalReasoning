  "Problem": "Consider the transfer function of a linear system represented by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We investigate the system's response to complex inputs and the effect of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the input to the system is modified by a convolution with the function \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+c} \\\\), will the output's dependence on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be altered?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic, where the combined effect of both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) determines the response. The system's output will now be the result of these intertwined effects, modifying how the input relates to the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → b; b → s^2 + as + b; s^2 + as + b → H(s); H(s) → output; c → G(s); G(s) → modified input; modified input → H(s); H(s) → output"
