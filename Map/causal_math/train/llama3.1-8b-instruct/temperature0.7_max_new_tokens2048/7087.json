  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform resulting in a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation matrix \\\\( B \\\\) modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at a certain time to be \\\\( f'(t) = e^{Bt}e^{At} \\\\) and then we compute the Laplace transform, does \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the perturbation matrix \\\\( B \\\\) alters the function to \\\\( f'(t) = e^{Bt}e^{At} \\\\), affecting the resultant Laplace transform. The new transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) reflects properties of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), due to the combined effects of the matrices in the exponent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
