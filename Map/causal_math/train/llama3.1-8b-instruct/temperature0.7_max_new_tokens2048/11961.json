  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) where S is a constant matrix. The impact of the complex function \\\\( h(x) = e^{iDt}x \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t=0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t=T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions in potentially unknown ways, especially if the details of D are not known. The transformation can affect magnitudes and phases of vector components, thus without knowledge of D's effect, tracing back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
