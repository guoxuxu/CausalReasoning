  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) and we explore the functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\). We evaluate the behavior and causal inference scenarios of this function under various transformations and time periods.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sqrt{z} \\\\) is applied at \\\\( x = x_1 \\\\), where \\\\( x_1 < T \\\\), will the result at \\\\( x = T \\\\) depend solely on the original function without considering the effects of \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) further modifies \\\\( z \\\\) by taking its square root, which interacts with the preceding squaring and addition from \\\\( g \\\\), thereby altering the pathway and final result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The dependencies on both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\) must be considered to correctly describe the transformation process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
