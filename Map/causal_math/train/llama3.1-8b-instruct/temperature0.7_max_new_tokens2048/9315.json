  "Problem": "We investigate the influence of a function transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + v \\\\) within the context of a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and v is a constant complex transformation vector.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + c \\\\) (where c is a constant complex number) is introduced as intervention, will the outcome \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on v or c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional dimension of complexity. The final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) will indeed depend on the original transformation vector v, the interim intervention c, and the structure of A. The shift operations and their sequential impacts can significantly modify the evolution under \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
