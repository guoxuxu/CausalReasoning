  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz + u \\\\) with \\\\( u \\\\) being a control function and \\\\( D \\\\) a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf a new control function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention starting at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), replacing \\\\( u(t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) and a specific \\\\( s \\\\) only reflect the influence of \\\\( D \\\\) and not \\\\( v \\\\) or \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( v(t) \\\\) impacts the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in addition to the original impact from \\\\( u \\\\), thereby affecting the resultant Laplace transform. Both control functions add to the non-homogeneous part of the equation, and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) incorporates effects from \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( u \\\\), and \\\\( v \\\\), not solely from \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
