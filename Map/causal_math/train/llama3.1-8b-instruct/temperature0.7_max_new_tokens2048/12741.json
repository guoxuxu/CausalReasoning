  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The function is modified by an integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt}z(t) dt \\\\), with B as another real constant.\n\nGiven the modified output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after applying \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at the start, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\), involving integration with the exponential function affected by B, obscures the exact initial state because various initial conditions could potentially yield the same integrated transformation result, especially without precise knowledge of B relative to A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
