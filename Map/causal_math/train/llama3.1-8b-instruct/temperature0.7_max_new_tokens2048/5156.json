  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) where S is a complex square matrix. The system evaluates the function's behavior under the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nFrom the observed endpoint \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we determine explicitly which matrix (S or Q) governed the function at which time periods?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly which matrix was active and when, based solely on the Laplace transform result, is generally infeasible due to the intrinsic nature of the transform obscuring specific earlier states and times of action. Additionally, matrices S and Q effects can intertwine, further complicating the traceability.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
