  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) with a boundary condition u(0) = 0. Analyze its behavior under the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention by setting a different boundary condition at a specific point x_1 is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does it influence the solution \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at t = T (T > t_1) solely based on the original PDE's parameters and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adjusts the boundary conditions, while the transformed equation incorporates the exponential decay term \\\\( e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\). Hence, the resultant behavior of \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at any given time T > t_1 depends both on the new boundary conditions and on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), altering the dynamics described by the original PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
