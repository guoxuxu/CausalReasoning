  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}\\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a function of real variable t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf a manipulation modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+C)t} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_0 > 0 \\\\), where C is another complex constant, will the Laplace transform of the modified \\\\(z(t)\\\\), \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), still depend solely on A?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduces a new parameter C, which changes the function to \\\\( e^{(A+C)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of the new function will be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(A+C)} \\\\), making it dependent on both A and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
