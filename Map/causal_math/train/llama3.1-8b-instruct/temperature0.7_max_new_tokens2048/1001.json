  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a matrix-valued function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane and is examined over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) to time \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) changes the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\), which will then evolve differently under the dynamical law \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\). The subsequent state trajectories will thus be dependent on \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in different outcomes at \\\\( t = T \\\\) compared to the untransformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
