  "Problem": "Let \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(n\\\\) is a positive integer, define a transformation in the complex plane. Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\lambda z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant with a non-zero real part, describing an exponential decay or growth depending on the sign of the real part of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\). We aim to analyze how applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) affects the solutions over time.\n\nGiven that we observe \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) merely based on the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions used merely from the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is problematic due to the complex nature of interactions between exponential decay/growth, power transformations, and additional exponential modifiers. Different parameters and their interplays can yield similar end states, preventing precise identification of what interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
