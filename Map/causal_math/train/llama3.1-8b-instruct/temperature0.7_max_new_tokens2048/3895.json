  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Me^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U(z) = Ne^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) are another set of constant matrices) is applied at some time t = t_1, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexities into the system dynamics, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( P \\\\) but also on the effects of \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\). As such, all transformations influence the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
