  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( U(k) \\\\) is obtained by applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = 0 and then analyzing how \\\\( u(x) \\\\) evolves naturally by solving the PDE, will \\\\( U(k) \\\\) remain unchanged across the domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a solution to the PDE, which satisfies the given conditions, will remain invariant under the natural evolution of the PDE. As the PDE's characteristics don't change with respect to the transformation properties, \\\\( U(k) \\\\) remains stable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
