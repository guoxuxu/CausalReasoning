  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a particular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we infer precisely whether the modulation \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) was applied, by examining \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform may exhibit characteristics such as peaks or shifts that correspond to multiple possible modulations or a combination of them. Without additional information about the phase or timing of the modulations, it can be challenging to deduce exactly which modulations were applied, including whether \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) was part of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
