  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a function space, described by the integral transform \\\\(T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s)f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(x, s)\\\\) is the kernel function. We examine the transformation's behavior when the function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is introduced, and how adding a multiplication by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) as an intervention affects transformations.\n\nGiven the output \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\), can we determine precisely whether the function was modulated by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\), only knowing the transformed outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise interventions used on \\\\(f(s)\\\\) just by analyzing \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) is challenging due to potential similarities in the outcomes of various altered and unaltered \\\\(f(s)\\\\). The modification could affect integral results in non-trivial ways that mimic the effects of other possible transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
