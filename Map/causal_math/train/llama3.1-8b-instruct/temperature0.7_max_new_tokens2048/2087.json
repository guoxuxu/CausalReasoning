  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) periodically, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) (where D is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( C \\\\) and depend only on \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will depend on both transformations due to the chain of influence from initial condition modified by \\\\( C \\\\), and further altered by \\\\( D \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The nonlinear term in the dynamics further complicates the trajectory, making it dependent on both \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
