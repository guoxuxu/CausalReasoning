  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation ∂u/∂t = Lu where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on the solution, specifically, the operation defined by the function g(u) = F(u), where F denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under ∂u/∂t = Lu without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under ∂u/∂t = Lu?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform initially changes the domain from time-space to frequency domain, altering the way the differential operator L affects the function. The evolution of the transformed function under L in the frequency domain typically results in different dynamics compared to the original time-space domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
