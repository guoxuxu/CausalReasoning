  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different function \\\\( j(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( j(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) further introduces a new modifying factor, meaning the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). The compounding effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) through their exponential contributions change both phase and magnitude, altering the trajectory and endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
