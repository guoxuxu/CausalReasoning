  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function describes an oscillatory system in the complex plane. We examine the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system and its implications on the causal inference.\n\nIf the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known at time T, is it possible to determine the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without knowing whether the function form was altered?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace transform of the system \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), one can solve for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as it directly appears in the expression. The structure of the transform allows for the determination of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) irrespective of alterations to the amplitude or other factors, as long as the exponential form with \\\\( i\\omega \\\\) remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
