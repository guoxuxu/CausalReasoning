  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which maps complex function input in the time domain to the frequency domain. An intervention involves altering the system by a complex function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) such that the new system's output is \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by adding a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) simply be the product \\\\( X(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\\\), solely determined by \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system output to \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\). This alteration is a direct product of the Laplace transforms, hence depending uniquely on \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
