  "Problem": "Assume a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolves over time t governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\), with A being a complex constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly determine what interventions were employed (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The conclusion \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially be the result of various combinations or types of interventions due to the complex interactions and commutative properties of the exponential transformations. The overlap in potential states makes it ambiguous and obstructs the clear identification of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
