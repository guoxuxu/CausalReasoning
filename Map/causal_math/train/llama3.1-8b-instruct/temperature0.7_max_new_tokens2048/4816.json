  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nKnowing \\\\( G(w) \\\\), the Fourier Transform of the altered function after intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise nature of both the original function and the intervention from \\\\( G(w) \\\\) alone is challenging. Multiple pairs of function and interventions can yield the same transformed result due to the complexity introduced by squaring and other non-linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
