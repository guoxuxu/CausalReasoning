  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\), where s is a complex variable. We advance to analyze the system transformed by the Laplace transform with respect to s, denoted by \\\\( L \\\\{ z(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of an altered Laplace transformation, can we uniquely determine the operation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) applied post-transformation, assuming the initial function was \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying \\\\( G(s) \\\\) from the post-intervention Laplace transform requires inversion processes that are typically fraught with ambiguities due to non-unique solutions, particularly in the absence of constraints or additional information about the nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
