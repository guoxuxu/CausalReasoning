  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At} x \\), where \\( x \\) is a complex vector and \\( A \\) is a complex square matrix. Evaluate the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another complex matrix, on this function over a period \\( T \\).\n\nIs it possible to determine whether interventions \\( J(z) \\) or just \\( I(z) \\) were applied, based solely on knowledge of the final state \\( I(z) \\) up to \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials and the possible lack of unique inverse transformations, the final outcome \\( I(z) \\) could result from various combinations of applying \\( J(z) \\) and \\( I(z) \\), or either individually. Thus, without additional information, it is not feasible to ascertain the exact sequence or nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
