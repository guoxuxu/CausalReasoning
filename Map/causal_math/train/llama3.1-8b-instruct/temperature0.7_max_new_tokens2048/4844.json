  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) representing a surface in 3D space. We are examining the effect of two transformations: \\\\(T1(u,v) = (u+1, v-1)\\\\) and \\\\(T2(u,v) = (uv, u-v)\\\\) on the initial coordinate point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\).\n\nCan the application and types of transformations (\\\\(T1\\\\), \\\\(T2\\\\), or both) be identified clearly from the endpoint value of \\\\(z(x, y)\\\\) after applying them sequentially?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final value of \\\\(z\\\\), it's challenging to backtrack and determine which transformations were applied due to the non-linear nature of \\\\(T2\\\\) and the ambiguity in potential coordinate pathways leading to the same final value of \\\\(z\\\\), especially when transformations are not invertible or overlap in effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
