  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time under the influence of the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\overline{z} \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant complex matrices, and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) represents the complex conjugate of \\\\( z \\\\). We explore the implications of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix, at different times.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant complex matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional influences on the system's trajectory, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) are non-trivial transformations, their integrated effect along with the base dynamics affects the trajectory and consequently, the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
