  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) as a signal through a linear system described by the transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-ix}z(x)dx \\\\). We explore the causal inference ability by analyzing the system's response using advanced calculus and integral transformations.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is input into the system and allowed to transform through \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without any other interference, does the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) solely depend on the properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) directly determines the integrand in the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the result of the transformation is directly determined by the properties of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), predominantly its periodic nature and complex exponential form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
