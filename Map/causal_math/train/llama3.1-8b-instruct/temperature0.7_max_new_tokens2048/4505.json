  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\) where \\( f(t) \\) is a time-dependent function and \\( s \\) is a complex variable. We analyze the causal influence of multiplying \\( f(t) \\) by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\( f(t) \\) is initially multiplied by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), resulting in \\( f'(t) = e^{i\\omega t}f(t) \\), and then left to evolve without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\( F'(s) \\) of \\( f'(t) \\) be different from \\( F(s-i\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\( f(t) \\) by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) shifts the parameter \\( s \\) in the Laplace transform by \\( -i\\omega \\). Thus, \\( F'(s) = F(s-i\\omega) \\), indicating the effect is consistent with the properties of the Laplace transform when dealing with time shifts introduced by a complex exponential factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
