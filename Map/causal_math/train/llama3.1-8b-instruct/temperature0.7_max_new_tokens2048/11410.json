  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nGiven the result produced by \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation by \\\\( L \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time with exponential weighting, which can obscure specific details of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) especially its phase components. Different functions could potentially yield the same result under \\\\( L \\\\), particularly if they are phase-shifted versions of each other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
