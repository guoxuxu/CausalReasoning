  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(z(t))dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T[f] \\\\) without any further modifications, will the resultant transformation at time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( T[f] \\\\) to the function evolved up to \\\\( T \\\\) under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) as defined involves integrating over the entire time domain affected by the initial function's evolution according to the differential equation, ensuring that changes in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the equation are inherently accounted for. Therefore, applying \\\\( T[f] \\\\) initially or after some evolution time \\\\( T \\\\) results in equivalent outcomes.",
