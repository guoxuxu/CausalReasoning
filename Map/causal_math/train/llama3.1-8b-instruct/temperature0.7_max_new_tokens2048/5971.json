  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf a filtering operation that removes a specific frequency band including \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is applied before Fourier transforming the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the original spectral feature at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remain in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a frequency band elimination filter removes components at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), thus when the Fourier transform is applied post-filtering, the resultant spectrum will not contain the delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This shows a direct dependency of the spectral output on the intervention (filtering).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "filtering_operation → removal of specific frequency band; removal of specific frequency band → absence of frequency ω in F(ω); ω → F(ω); F(ω) → presence or absence of frequency ω; filtering_operation → F(ω); F(ω) → ω"
