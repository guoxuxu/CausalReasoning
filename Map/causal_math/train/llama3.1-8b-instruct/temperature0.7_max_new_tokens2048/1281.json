  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. We are interested in the causality implications of an integral transformation applied to initial conditions given by some function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) related to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a Laplace transform.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is calculated for an initial function \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) without further manipulation, will \\\\( h(u(t)) \\\\) be identical for all s in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transformed function \\\\( h(u(t)) \\\\) depends on how the Laplace transform behaves across different values of s, possibly affecting convergence and thus altering the outcome of the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
