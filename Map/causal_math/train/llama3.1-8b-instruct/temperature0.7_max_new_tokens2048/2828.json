  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) with A being a positive constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the scenario where a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transformations \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{C(t-t_1)} \\\\) could yield overlapping or indistinguishable effects regarding magnitude and phase changes, making it challenging to uniquely backtrack and identify which transformations were applied at what times solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
