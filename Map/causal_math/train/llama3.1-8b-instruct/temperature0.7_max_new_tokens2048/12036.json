  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We explore different causal influences on the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse transformations under varying conditions.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number) at t = 0 and is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) \\\\), does \\\\( f(z) \\\\) only depend on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) results in \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). This transformation absolutely depends on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\). The result distinctly represents the influence of \\\\( a \\\\) on the transform without external factors influencing the system after t = 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
