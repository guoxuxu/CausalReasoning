  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) representing heat flow in a medium where L is a differential operator. We look at the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) during the evolution.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we specifically identify the sequence or type of transforms (\\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( R(u) \\\\), or both) applied throughout its evolution, just by observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to blending effects of thermal diffusion and multiple feasible transformations by \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( R(u) \\\\), similar end-states might result from different combinations and sequences of transforms, making it indistinguishable without additional data on intermediate states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
