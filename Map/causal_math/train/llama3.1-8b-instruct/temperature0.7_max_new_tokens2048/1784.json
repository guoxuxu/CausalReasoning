  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant linking \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and another independent real-valued function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\\\alpha y \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a positive decay constant. We analyze the impact of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from different sequences or types of interventions. This ambiguity is due to properties of exponential transformations and their effects on z's trajectory. Particularly, the non-commutative nature of complex exponential functions introduces significant pathways ambiguity, preventing a unique identification of applied interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
