  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely deduce the original time-domain function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) provides a complete frequency-domain characterization of the function, which is a reversible transformation. Knowing the Fourier-transformed function at any time allows for an exact reconstruction of the original function at any other time, including \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), by applying the inverse Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
