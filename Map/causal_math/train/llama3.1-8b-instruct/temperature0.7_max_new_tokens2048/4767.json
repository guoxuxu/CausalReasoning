  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an operation \\\\( N \\\\), another convolution with a different kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\), is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the process of applying \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will the final result depend solely on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\\\( N \\\\) introduces a new dynamic, and the final state of the system depends on the interaction of all transformations \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and \\\\( N \\\\). The modifying effect of \\\\( N \\\\) can't be negated or isolated from the influences of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
