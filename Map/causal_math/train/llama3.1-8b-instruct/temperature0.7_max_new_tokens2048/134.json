  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where A is a real constant and x is a complex initial state. Consider the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce the original value of \\\\( x \\\\) assuming the frequency \\\\( A \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform will reveal the relationship between the frequencies involved and the function's behavior, retrieving the exact original state \\\\( x \\\\) solely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and the known value of \\\\( A \\\\) is underdetermined since information about the phase and specific complex amplitude of \\\\( x \\\\) can be lost.",
