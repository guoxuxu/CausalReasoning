  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a Laplace transform is applied as an intervention to the system, will the final state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original heat equation without considering the scope of the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another integral transformation, like the Laplace transform, changes the dynamics and representation of the system. The combined effects of the Fourier transform and a subsequent Laplace intervention can alter how the system state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) evolves over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
