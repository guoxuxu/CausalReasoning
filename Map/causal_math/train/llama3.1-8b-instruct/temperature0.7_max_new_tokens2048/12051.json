  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) that represents a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which undergoes a transformation given by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). We examine how this transformation affects the causal relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output, is it possible to determine whether the transformation \\( h(t) = t^2 \\) was applied before transforming \\( z(t) \\), by examining \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t) \\cdot h(t)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "By analyzing \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t) \\cdot h(t)) \\) and its deviation from \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\), one can infer the application of \\( h(t) = t^2 \\). The alteration in the frequency-domain characteristics and the presence of terms indicative of \\( t^2 \\) multiplication allow us to determine the intervention accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
