  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) with A being a positive constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the scenario where a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{C(t-t_1)}z \\\\) (where C is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on A, B, and C because each exponential transformation (from B initially and C during intervention) influences both the magnitude and phase shift of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) independently, altering the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
