  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. The Laplace transform of the function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} + i\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the function in the s-domain. We further apply an integral transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention occurs by applying another transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will the final output \\\\( z''(T) \\\\), where T > t_1, only depend on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( z''(T) \\\\) will depend on the original function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and the transformations \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) due to the compounded effects of these transformations. The interventions modify how \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is transformed in the s-domain, influencing the final outcome in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
