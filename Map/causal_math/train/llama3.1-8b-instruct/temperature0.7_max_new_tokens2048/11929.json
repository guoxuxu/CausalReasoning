  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We are interested in understanding how the integral transforms, specifically the Laplace transform, affect this function and its causal inference.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function, can we determine if the original function was \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform encapsulates a function into its s-domain representation and without additional information such as the region of convergence or initial conditions, multiple different time-domain functions could correspond to the same s-domain representation due to similarities in their transform properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
