  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is theoretically invertible under suitable conditions; however, practical inversion generally requires knowledge of the entire function over all s, and possible singularities or essential details could be lost in transformation, making precise reconstruction non-trivial.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
