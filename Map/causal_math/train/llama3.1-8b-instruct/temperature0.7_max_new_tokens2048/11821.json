  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear time-invariant system characterized by an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The output of the system \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\\\). We then apply a Fourier transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Y(f) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(f) \\\\), the Fourier transform of the output, can we always uniquely determine both \\\\( X(f) \\\\) and \\\\( H(f) \\\\) without prior knowledge of either?",
  "Explanation": "If either \\\\( X(f) \\\\) or \\\\( H(f) \\\\) includes zeroes, there could be an infinite number of possible pairs of functions whose products result in the observed \\\\( Y(f) \\\\). Without additional constraints or information about either the signal or the system, these cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
