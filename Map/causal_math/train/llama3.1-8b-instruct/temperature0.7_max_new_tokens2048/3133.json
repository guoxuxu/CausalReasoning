  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nIf a non-zero initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is Fourier transformed to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the wave equation without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) still satisfy the wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial conditions converts the problem into the frequency domain, where each frequency component evolves independently according to the wave equation. The evolution in the frequency domain still obeys the transformed wave equation, indicating that the causal dynamics are preserved even after the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
