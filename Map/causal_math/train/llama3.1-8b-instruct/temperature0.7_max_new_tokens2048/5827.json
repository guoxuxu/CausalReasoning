  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by two variables x and y, related by the complex function \\( z = x + yi \\). We look into how the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z \\, ds \\) influences z over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nAssuming an intervention applying a new function \\( g(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{sB}z \\, ds \\) (where B is another constant complex number) at an intermediate time \\( t_1 \\), will the final state \\( z(T) \\) be influenced solely by A and not by B or the initial transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) modify the trajectory by altering the state, the final \\( z(T) \\) reflects the cumulative impact of A, B, and the initial function \\( f \\). The system’s path is altered, making \\( z(T) \\) dependent on all these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
