  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\(S(z) = Vz\\\\) (where \\\\(V\\\\) is also a unitary matrix) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be independent of the initial transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though both transformations are unitary and therefore preserve the norm and the orthogonality, the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will depend on both \\\\(U\\\\) and \\\\(V\\\\) because these transformations can change the basis of the eigenvectors involved. This affects how the state evolves through the dynamics governed by \\\\(A\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
