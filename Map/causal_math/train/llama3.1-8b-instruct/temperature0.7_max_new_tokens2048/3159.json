  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\) an external source changes the temperature profile to \\\\(u(x,t_1) = v(x)\\\\), will the temperature at a later time T depend solely on the thermal diffusivity constant k?",
  "Explanation": "The new temperature profile \\\\(v(x)\\\\) introduced as an intervention fundamentally alters the conditions from that instant onward. Thus, the temperature at time T, while depending on the diffusivity k, also significantly depends on the new profile \\\\(v(x)\\\\) imposed at time \\\\(t_1\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
