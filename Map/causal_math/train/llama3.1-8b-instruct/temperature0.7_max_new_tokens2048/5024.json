  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear operator describing the system's inductance matrix. Analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\(\\phi(V) = e^{Mt}V\\), where \\(M\\) is another inductance matrix, on the voltage \\(V\\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\(\\phi(V)\\), \\(\\psi(V)\\), or both) were applied, merely by observing the value of \\(V(T)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\(V(T)\\) can potentially result from different sequences or combinations of transformations due to the linearly non-commutative properties of the matrix exponentials in \\(M\\) and \\(N\\). Multiple intervention paths may yield the same endpoint, increasing ambiguity in back-calculating the exact interventions that occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
