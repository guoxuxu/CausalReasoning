  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is considered for modeling the effect of time-dependent rotations on this system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by the natural evolution governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) does not alter the system's natural orbit trajectory in this specific scenario. Both initial conditions, whether transformed or not, will rotate about the origin at the same rate per the governing equation, leading to equivalent positions at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
