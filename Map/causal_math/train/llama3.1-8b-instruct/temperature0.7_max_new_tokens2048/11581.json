  "Problem": "Consider the response space of a signal processing system, modeled by the integral transform \\( Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\), known as the Laplace transform. We explore the effect of modifying the input signal \\( x(t) \\) by a function \\( f(x) = e^{At}x(t) \\), where A is a constant.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a signal \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to process this signal under \\( Y(s) \\) without further intervention, will \\( Y(s) \\) at s = S be the same as if \\( x_0(t) \\) was directly processed to s = S under \\( Y(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) to \\( x_0(t) \\) modifies the original signal to \\( e^{At}x_0(t) \\), which changes the Laplace transform of the input. The e-factor introduces an exponential shift in the Laplace domain, resulting in a different response \\( Y(s) \\) at s = S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
