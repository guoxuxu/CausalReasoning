  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations and sequences of transformations due to overlapping effects from exponential scaling and given that the differential equation includes both rotation and offset. This makes it impossible to deduce unambiguously which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
