  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at a later time T without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the inverse Fourier transform to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), the original state of the system \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) can be retrieved, which exactly reflects the propagated state from \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) under the governing heat equation, assuming no external perturbations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
