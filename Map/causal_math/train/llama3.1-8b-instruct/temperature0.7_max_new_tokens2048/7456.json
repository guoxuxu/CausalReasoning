  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nAssuming that the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is known, can we precisely determine whether the initial transformation applied was \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\), the intervention was \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it}w \\\\), or both, based solely on the value of \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Various combinations of initial transformations and interventions could lead to the same \\\\( w(T) \\\\) due to the nature of complex exponential rotation. The impact of A, coupled with the potential phase shifts introduced by each transformation, can result in identical final states from different initial conditions and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
