  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, is investigated.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used based solely on the information of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for overlapping effects from the non-commutative properties of the exponential matrices and multiple possible paths leading to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it is not feasible to definitively identify what transformations were applied. The effect of one can mask or mimic the other, leading to ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
