  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of the transformation given by the function \\\\( g(u) = v^{Dx}u \\\\) over spatial domain x, where \\\\(D\\\\) is a constant operator and \\\\(v\\\\) is a function of x.\n\nIf an intervention by another transformation \\\\( h(u) = w^{Ex}u \\\\) (where \\\\(E\\\\) is another constant operator and \\\\(w\\\\) another function of x) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(D\\\\) or \\\\(E\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) introduces more complexity to the system, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\(D\\\\), \\\\(E\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\). Each operator could differently influence how transformations such as \\\\( v^{Dx} \\\\) and \\\\( w^{Ex} \\\\) interact and alter the trajectory and endpoint of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
