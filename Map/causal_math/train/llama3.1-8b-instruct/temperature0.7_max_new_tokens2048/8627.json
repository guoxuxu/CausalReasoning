  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact of the Laplace Transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) that represents a time-domain signal, specifically focusing on how applying the inverse Laplace Transform affects inference regarding the original function.\n\nIf an additional filtering operation represented by a function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) in the transform domain to modify it to \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\), will the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) give a result purely influenced by \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will yield the convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with the inverse transform of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), due to the convolution theorem. Thus, the result is influenced by both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the effect of the filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
