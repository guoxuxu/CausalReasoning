  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that governs the temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is a constant. We consider the impact of an initial condition modification \\\\(u(x, 0) = h(x)\\\\) and the application of a transformation \\\\(u(x, t) = v(x, t) + w(x, t)\\\\), where \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) solves the original PDE and \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\) is another function introduced as an intervention.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (specific form of \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\)) were applied during the evolution, solely based on knowledge of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diffusive nature and multiple possible intervening functions that could result in the same temperature profile at time T, it is not feasible to unambiguously determine the exact form of \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\) used at any specific time during the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
