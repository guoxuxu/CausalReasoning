  "Problem": "Consider a system undergoing complex function transformations governed by \\\\( z(t) = f(z), \\\\) where \\\\( f(z) = ze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant. We analyze how integral transformations like the Laplace transform affect the trajectory over time.\n\nIf an intervention involving another transformation \\\\( g(z) = ze^{-i\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the trajectory at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without being influenced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another phase-modifying term, affecting the trajectory significantly. The end result, especially in complex domains, depends non-trivially on both transformations, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), leading to interaction effects that alter the original function's intended impact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
