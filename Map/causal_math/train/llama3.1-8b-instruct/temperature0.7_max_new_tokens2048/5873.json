  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}s \\\\, ds \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, applied to the system's state over time interval t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is integrated with initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Initially applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions through integral transformation, which generally won't commute with the continuous evolution under D. Thus, the path and final state will be altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
