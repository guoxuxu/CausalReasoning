  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented in matrix form \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. The system is transformed by performing a Laplace transform which alters the system to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform, and s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf given a solution \\\\(X(s)\\\\) that satisfies the transformed equation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\), can we determine the original vector x without applying the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Obtaining the original vector x directly from \\\\(X(s)\\\\) without applying the inverse Laplace transform is not possible because the transformation involves integration and other operations that fundamentally change the nature of the data, requiring a proper inverse operation to revert.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
