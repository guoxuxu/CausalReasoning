  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0 \\\\), with p(t) and q(t) being continuous functions of time t. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation applied to y(t), specifically looking at the transformed function \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf an alteration characterized by another differential equation \\\\( y'' + r(t) y' + s(t) y = 0 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a time t1, will the altered Laplace transform \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) at any time T > t1 only depend on the original p(t), q(t) and not on the new r(t), s(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the governing dynamics of the system through r(t) and s(t), which alters how the solution y(t) behaves post-intervention. This new behavior is reflected in the changed Laplace transform \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\), meaning it now depends not only on the original p(t) and q(t) but also on r(t) and s(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
