  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the integral equation \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} K(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( K(t) \\) is a time-dependent control function applied to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\( f(y) = Cy + D \\) where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constant matrices, at time \\( t_0 \\).\n\nIf another transformation \\( g(y) = Ey + F \\) (where \\( E \\) and \\( F \\) are constant matrices) is applied as an intervention at a later time \\( t_1 > t_0 \\), does the final state \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on the matrix \\( A \\) and not on \\( C, D, E, \\) or \\( F \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(y) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) further complicates the dynamics by altering \\( y(t_1) \\), making \\( y(T) \\) dependent on the combinations of \\( C, D, E, \\) and \\( F \\), as well as \\( A \\). The effect of these successive transformations means the final state at \\( T \\) is influenced by multiple factors beyond the original matrix \\( A \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
