  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) is used to transform a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) into a complex function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) of a complex variable \\\\(s\\\\). We then apply an inverse Laplace transform to retrieve \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nCan we determine which operator \\\\(G(s)\\\\) was applied to modify \\\\(F(s)\\\\) just by knowing the final time-dependent function obtained after the inverse transform?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific operator \\\\(G(s)\\\\) from the altered time function is generally infeasible without additional constraints or information about \\\\(G(s)\\\\). Multiple distinct operators could result in the same transformation effect, leading to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
