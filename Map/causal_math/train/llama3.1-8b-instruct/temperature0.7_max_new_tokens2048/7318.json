  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be accurately deduced from the observed \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) assuming no knowledge of whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied, the transformation due to the differential operator could establish fundamentally different initial conditions (\\\\( a_n(0) \\\\)). Thus, determining the exact original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) would be ambiguous due to potential modifications in the eigen-coefficients.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
