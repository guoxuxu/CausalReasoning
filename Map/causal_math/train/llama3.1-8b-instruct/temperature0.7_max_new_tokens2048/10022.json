  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 5 \\\\). We deploy an operator transformation \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^z t dt \\\\) over the domain of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( T(f(x)) \\\\) for some \\\\( x \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) using only the outcome of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing if it was derived from \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), generating a result that is a higher-dimensional transformation of the input. Without knowing if this output is derived specifically from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and not from an arbitrary function, we cannot uniquely reverse engineer to find \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The integration process obscures the specific form and roots of the original polynomial.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
