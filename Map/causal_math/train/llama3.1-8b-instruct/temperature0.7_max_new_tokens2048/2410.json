  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nObserving the trajectory \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can one deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of the rotation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly reconstruct the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the observed state could any complex number rotated by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\), generating ambiguity in retracing \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
