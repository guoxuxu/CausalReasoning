  "Problem": "Examine the implications of the integral transformation \\\\( I[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\,dt \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, when a multiplier transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^m \\\\) is also applied either before or after \\\\( I[f] \\\\), with \\\\( m \\\\) also being a positive integer.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( I[f] \\\\) directly to \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) and then multiplying the result by \\\\( t^m \\\\) yield the same outcome as multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( t^m \\\\) first before applying \\\\( I[f] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Performing the integral transformation before multiplying by \\\\( t^m \\\\) yields a result based on the integral of \\\\( t^n \\\\), not considering any interaction from \\\\( t^m \\\\). In contrast, multiplying first alters \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( t^{n+m} \\\\), changing the nature of the integral. These operations do not commute due to the differing order of exponentiation and integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
