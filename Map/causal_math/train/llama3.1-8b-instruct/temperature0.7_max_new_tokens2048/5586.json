  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x, t)\\\\, dx \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing that Fourier transformation was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation and the wave equation both preserve essential information that can be inversely transformed. Knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), one can apply the inverse Fourier transform and track back the evolution via \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\) to find \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), owing to the reversible nature of the wave dynamics and transform.",
