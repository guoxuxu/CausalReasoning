  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving through a vector field described by the velocity function \\\\( v(x, t) = Ax + h(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and h(t) is a time-dependent vector function. We explore the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{As}x ds \\\\) on the particle's trajectory.\n\nKnowing the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at the end, can we specify exactly whether the initial or mid-point transformations (\\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) or \\\\( S_t(x) \\\\)) or both were applied, just by studying \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could arise from different combinations and timings of applying \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) and \\\\( S_t(x) \\\\). These transformations, due to their integration over matrix exponentials, do not leave distinctive enough traces to unambiguously infer the type or sequence of transformations used without more specific data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
