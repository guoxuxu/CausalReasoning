  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a constant complex vector. We are interested in evaluating the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) is applied at a specific time during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) introduces a dependency on B along with A due to the integration involving \\\\( e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) \\\\). This transformation affects the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) relies on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
