  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time system represented by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( u(s) \\\\) a varying vector function of time. Study the effect of applying a temporal shift transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) a time shift constant and \\\\( B \\\\) another matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer the original input function \\\\( u(s) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\) modifies the original input in a way that changes how the output is integrated over time. Without knowledge of whether this shift transformation was applied, it's not possible to unambiguously recover the original form of \\\\( u(s) \\\\) just from observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
