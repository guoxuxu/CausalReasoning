  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = My\\\\), and M is a constant matrix. We study the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) applied at different instances, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a different function \\\\( k(y) = e^{Ft}y \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state of \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively reflect changes due to F and not D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(y) = e^{Ft}y \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional factor influencing the trajectory of the system. The final state, \\\\( y(T) \\\\), hinges on the effects of both D and F on the system; thus, it reflects influences from both transformations, compounding their effects on the system evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
