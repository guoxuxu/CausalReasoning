  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that operates on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined over some domain, and a transformation \\\\( T \\\\) represented by the integral \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-(x-s)} u(s) ds \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on the function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and how it influences causal inferences in the scenario.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from the transformed state \\\\( T[u](x) \\\\) without knowing that \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge that the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, it is infeasible to uniquely determine the original form of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) just by observing \\\\( T[u](x) \\\\) because the integral transformation summarizes and alters information from the original function over its domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
