  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the influence of a transform \\\\( g(t) = t * f(t) \\\\) and its Laplace equivalent \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\) on different situations.\n\nKnowing the resulting transform \\\\( H(s) = F(s - k) \\\\), can we determine with certainty if the exponential function was indeed used as an intervention, or could other functions have been applied to achieve the same transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Similar transformations in the Laplace domain can potentially result from different functions, not exclusively from an exponential intervention. The shift property could similarly be mimicked by other operations, such as convolution with another function, making it impossible to uniquely ascertain the exact nature of the intervention without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
