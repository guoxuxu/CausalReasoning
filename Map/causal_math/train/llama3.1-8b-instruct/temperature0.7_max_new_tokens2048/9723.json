  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform intervention \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve, will the solution at time \\\\(T\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) still be predictable using only the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform at \\\\(t_1\\\\) alters the system's state in the frequency domain. The transformation can modify the energy distribution among different modes differently than it would under pure diffusive behavior, making the process dependent both on the original heat equation and the effects of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
