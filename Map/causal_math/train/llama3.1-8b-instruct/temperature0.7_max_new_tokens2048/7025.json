  "Problem": "Consider the control of a heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) on a domain, where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a thermal diffusivity constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) denotes the Laplacian. An intervention involves changing boundary conditions at a specific time using a function \\\\( h(t,x) = e^{\\\\lambda t}g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is a spatial function.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system evolves under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if the initial condition was the steady-state solution satisfying \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) under the same boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\) modifies the boundary conditions dynamically, and since heat equations are sensitive to initial and boundary conditions, the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) will evolve differently from the steady-state solution unless \\\\( \\\\lambda = 0 \\\\). This varying boundary condition influences how heat diffuses throughout the domain over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
