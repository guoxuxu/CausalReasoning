  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effects of modifying the system with a transformation represented by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine precisely the interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) solely from the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that matrix exponential transformations, such as \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), can overlap in their effects, predicting the exact sequence or type of interventions solely from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible. This ambiguity arises due to the variety of trajectories that can achieve the same end state under different interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
