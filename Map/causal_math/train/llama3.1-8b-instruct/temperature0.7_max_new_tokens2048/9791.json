  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex number constant. The analysis focuses on the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex number constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a third complex number constant) is applied as an intervention, will the result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) introduces another modification to the dynamics, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on P but also significantly on Q and R. These transformations can interact and affect the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in a compounded manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
