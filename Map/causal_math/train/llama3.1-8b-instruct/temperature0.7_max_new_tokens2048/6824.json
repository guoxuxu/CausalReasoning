  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by a linear time-dependent operator \\\\( L(t) = Ae^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar. The evolution of the system without interventions follows the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t L(s)z(s) ds + z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the end, can we determine whether \\\\( L(t) \\\\), \\\\( M(t) \\\\), or both were applied at various times, purely based on the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of applications and interactions between \\\\( L(t) \\\\) and \\\\( M(t) \\\\), and potentially other unknown factors. The complex function's path influenced by these time-varying operators can yield similar outcomes under different scenarios, making it indeterminate just from observing the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
