  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T, can we ascertain whether an intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied at any time t_1 < T, just by examining the frequency components?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of additional frequency components or changes in amplitude at T may suggest an intervention, but cannot conclusively prove the exact nature (or presence) of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without additional information. Multiple different interventions could produce similar effects in the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
