  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately deduce the sequence of transformations applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\), each integrating the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with distinct complex exponential weights, complicate the pathway to \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without explicit records of the transformations applied, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine the sequence of operations leading to it.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
