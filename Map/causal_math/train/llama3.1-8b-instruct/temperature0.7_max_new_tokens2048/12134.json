  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is known to reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\). We explore the impact of modifying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by a function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the time-domain representation of the function.\n\nIf an additional modifying function \\\\( F(s) = s^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( G(s) H(s) \\\\) before taking the inverse Laplace transform, will the resultant time-domain function still be a simple time shift of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( F(s) = s^2 \\\\) adds a differential operation to the original function (corresponding to the second derivative with respect to time in the time domain). This transformation significantly alters the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), resulting in more than just a time shift, typically introducing additional dynamic behavior such as acceleration components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
