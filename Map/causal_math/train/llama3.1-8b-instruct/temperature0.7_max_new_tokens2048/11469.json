  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and are solutions to the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P is a constant complex number and Q is a complex forcing term. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\), with another constant complex number S, investigates the effects on this system.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial complex condition by scaling and rotating it, depending upon S. The differential equations will evolve this altered condition in a new trajectory due to the effects of the transformation, resulting in a different complex value at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
