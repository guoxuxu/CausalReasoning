  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation on a complex function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\\\), where the integral is taken over a suitable contour in the complex plane. We explore how the transformation affects the inversion of the function via the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nIf an additional filtering operation, represented by multiplication with a function \\\\( H(z) \\\\), which is another Laplace transform, is applied before reversing the transformation, does the resulting function depend only on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function, now represented as \\\\( H(z)G(z) \\\\), will carry characteristics of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the filter \\\\( H(z) \\\\). The inversion through the inverse Laplace transform will thus yield a convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) with the inverse transform of \\\\( H(z) \\\\), indicating dependency on the filtering operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
