  "Problem": "Let us consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z' = i \\omega z\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function of time, \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\(T(z) = z e^{i \\theta t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is a constant real shift in frequency.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t=0\\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\), and thereafter evolves according to the system's rules without further transformation, will the state \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any later time \\\\(t=T\\\\) be the same as if the transformation was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\(z_0 e^{i \\theta t}\\\\). It alters the system's frequency from \\\\(\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\omega + \\theta\\\\), thus affecting the solution path over time. At any later time \\\\(T\\\\), the state will be different as it oscillates at a modified frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
