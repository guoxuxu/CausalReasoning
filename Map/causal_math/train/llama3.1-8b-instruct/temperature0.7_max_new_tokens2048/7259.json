  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{-i\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both initial and interventional transformations occur (\\\\( e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-i\\\\beta t} \\\\)), the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all parameters: \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). These complex rotations affect the evolution distinctively, altering the trajectory and final state of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
