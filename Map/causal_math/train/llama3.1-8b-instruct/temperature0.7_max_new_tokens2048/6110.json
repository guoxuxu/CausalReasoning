  "Problem": "Examine a continuous mathematical model using a Fourier transform, where a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) representing a signal is transformed into a frequency domain represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The causal properties of the system are influenced when a filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2} \\\\), with a real constant \\\\( a \\\\), is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) affects the attenuation of the signal's components depending on their frequency.\n\nCan we perfectly recover the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from the filtered signal \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific value of the constant \\\\( a \\\\) used in the filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) requires precise knowledge of the filter characteristics, specifically the constant \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). Without this, the inverse process cannot exactly compensate for the alterations made by the filter in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
