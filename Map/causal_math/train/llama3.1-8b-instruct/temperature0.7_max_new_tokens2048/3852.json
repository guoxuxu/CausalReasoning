  "Problem": "Examine a scenario where the integral transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), described by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt}f(t) dt \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) describes a physical system's response, and various transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) are studied to understand their influence over system behavior.\n\nIf provided with a Laplace transformed function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) that potentially involved an unknown modification like in the previous case, can we ascertain specifically whether such an intervention (multiplying by \\\\( e^{ax} \\\\)) was applied, just by using the functional form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional insight into the possible modifications or values of \\\\( a \\\\), numerous transformations multiply by exponential terms can lead to the same functional forms of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), due to properties such as the shifting theorem in the Laplace domain. Thus, it is ambiguous and cannot be definitively resolved without more data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "presence of e^{ax} term in g(x) → presence of a in f(x); g(x) → f(x); unknown modification → e^{ax} term in g(x)"
