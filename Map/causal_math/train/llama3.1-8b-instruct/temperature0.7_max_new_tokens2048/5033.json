  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network governed by the Laplace Transform of a complex function \\(\\overline{V}(s) = H(s)\\overline{I}(s)\\), where \\(H(s)\\) represents the system's transfer function and \\(\\overline{V}(s)\\) and \\(\\overline{I}(s)\\) are the Laplace transforms of the voltage and current, respectively. Suppose a filter with a specific impulse response \\( g(t) \\) characterized by its transfer function \\( G(s) \\) is introduced into the network.\n\nIf the network operates under a given input current \\( \\overline{I}(s) \\) without any filters, and later, \\( G(s) \\) is applied but removed before time t = T, does \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\) remain solely influenced by \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( G(s) \\) is applied and removed before the assessment of \\( \\overline{V}(T) \\), the voltage at T depends only on \\( H(s) \\) as it determines how the system inherently responds to \\( \\overline{I}(s) \\), given that \\( G(s) \\)'s effects would have nullified by its removal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
