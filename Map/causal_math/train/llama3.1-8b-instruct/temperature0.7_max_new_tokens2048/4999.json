  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\), where K is a matrix. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\), where L is a diagonal matrix and S is an invertible matrix, over the time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of \\\\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\) (where M is another diagonal matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on K and not on L or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces additional dynamic modifiers, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) contingent on both L and M, as well as K. The transformations via \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Lt}S \\\\) and \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Mt}S \\\\) add layers of complexity affecting the system's evolution and consequently influencing \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
