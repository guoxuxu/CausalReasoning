  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the parameters change to \\\\( a' \\\\) and \\\\( b' \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( a' \\\\) and \\\\( b' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing the parameters to \\\\( a' \\\\) and \\\\( b' \\\\) alters the nature of the exponential transformation post \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original and the new parameters, reflecting a composite effect of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
