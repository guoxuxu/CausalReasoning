  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a function space, described by the integral transform \\\\(T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s)f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(x, s)\\\\) is the kernel function. We examine the transformation's behavior when the function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is introduced, and how adding a multiplication by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) as an intervention affects transformations.\n\nIf at a certain point a modulation by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) for the altered \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}e^{as}\\\\) be equivalent to that from the original function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\), specifically modulating it by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\), which will alter the integral transform outcome due to the change in the function's behavior across the domain of integration. This results in a potentially different \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
