  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a system in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\), with real matrices P and Q. Examine the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{(C + iD)t}z \\\\), where C and D are also real matrices.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine definitively the specifics of what interventions occurred (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) throughout the timeline only by the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-commutative nature of exponential matrices in the complex domain, and potential overlapping effects of transformations, it is challenging to uniquely backtrack and ascertain specific interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Variabilities in how these matrices can be combined and influence the trajectory mean multiple possibilities could yield the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
