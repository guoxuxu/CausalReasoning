  "Problem": "Consider a function described by a complex form \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the complex variable z, respectively. Let \\\\( u(t) = e^{-t}cos(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t}sin(t) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied defined as \\\\( T(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with a complex parameter s.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the parameter s to a new value at time T = 1, will the resultant transformed function at a later time \\\\( T_2 \\\\) be only dependent on the new value of s and not on the previous value?",
  "Explanation": "The overall effect on the transformation up to \\\\( T_2 \\\\) will depend on both the initial setting of s and its later modification due to the continuous effect of the initial parameter on the system up to the point of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
