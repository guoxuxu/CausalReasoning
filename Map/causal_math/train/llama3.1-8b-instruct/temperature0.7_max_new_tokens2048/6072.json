  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor R, inductor L, and capacitor C in series, governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). The interaction is studied using the Laplace Transform to switch between the time domain and the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation after the intervention of the voltage source, can we determine precisely which intervention was applied (voltage magnitude and time of application) just by examining the altered transfer function in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency domain representation after applying a voltage source will evidence changes in system behavior and response, yet it does not uniquely specify the parameters of the intervention (specific magnitude or exact timing) due to potential overlap in how different parameters affect the transfer function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
