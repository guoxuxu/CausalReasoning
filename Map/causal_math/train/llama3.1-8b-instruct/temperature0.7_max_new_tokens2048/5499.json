  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), applied to complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representable by a series of sinusoids. The analysis explores the effects of modifying the function through an additive constant term, represented by \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) resulting in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied, does the outcome of \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) transformed by \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the constant \\\\( c \\\\) before applying \\\\( f \\\\) introduces a shift in the Laplace domain, represented as \\\\( f(z) + c/s \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace variable. This transformation depends on both the original function and the nature of the intervention \\\\( c \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
