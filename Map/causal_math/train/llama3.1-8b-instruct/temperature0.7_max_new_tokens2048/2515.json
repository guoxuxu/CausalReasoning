  "Problem": "Given a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix, consider examining the impact of the linear transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) for a matrix \\( Q \\). We investigate how this affects the system across different time points.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( S(x) = Px \\) (where \\( P \\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( M \\) and not on \\( Q \\) or \\( P \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( S(x) \\) introduces another layer of complexity, making the final state \\( x(T) \\) dependent on \\( Q \\), \\( P \\), and \\( M \\). The linear transformations \\( T(x) \\) and \\( S(x) \\) shape the trajectory of the system, influencing the endpoint \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
