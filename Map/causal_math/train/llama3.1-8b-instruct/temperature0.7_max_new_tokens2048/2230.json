  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, and \\\\(f\\\\) is holomorphic. We transform this function using the Laplace transform on the real part and the Fourier transform on the imaginary part, denoted as \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Re(f(x, y))\\\\}(s) + i\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{Im(f(x, y))\\\\}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nCan we precisely reconstruct \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s, \\\\omega)\\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace and Fourier transforms are invertible under certain conditions (such as ensuring sufficient decay and smoothness conditions), and \\\\(f\\\\) is holomorphic, precise reconstruction of the original function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) is feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
