  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the current state is modified by a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function. The linear transformation is represented by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the nonlinear function is \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the state vector in a complex function space.\n\nGiven a final state observed at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) solely from observing the outcome and knowing \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the system's evolution is not easily reversible. The squaring part particularly makes it difficult to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or whether \\\\( h \\\\) was applied because both the original and its negative root could yield the same result post-transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
