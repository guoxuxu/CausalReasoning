  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-x^2s} \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(s) = s^2 \\\\). We study the transformed function defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied without any alterations to the function \\\\( f(s) = s^2 \\\\), will the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at any value x be distinctly influenced by the specific choice of kernel without other external manipulations?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-x^2s} s^2 ds \\\\) explicitly depends on the form of the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\), changing the kernel directly influences the resulting function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), highlighting a direct causal effect from the kernel to the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The form of g(x) is influenced by the choice of the kernel K(x, s) when applied to f(s) = s^2, as the kernel directly affects the integral, which in turn affects g(x)."
