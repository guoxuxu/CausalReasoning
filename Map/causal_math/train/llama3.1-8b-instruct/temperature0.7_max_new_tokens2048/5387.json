  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The investigation involves examining the effects of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and its impact over the function transformation through \\\\\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a real constant) is applied, will the final result observed in the Laplace Transform for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) modifies the ongoing state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), hence complicating the resulting Laplace Transform. The final transform will involve impacts from both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), modifying frequency, decay rate, and other characteristics in the complex plane, making the final state dependent on all parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
