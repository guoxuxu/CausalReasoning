  "Problem": "Consider a control system represented by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a control input. Analyze the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on this system.\n\nGiven the endpoint Laplace transform \\\\(X(T)\\\\), is it possible to accurately determine which control inputs (whether \\\\(u(t)\\\\), \\\\(u'(t)\\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(x(T)\\\\) encodes information about the entire history of inputs and system dynamics but does not provide direct evidence of specific interventions like changes in control protocols. Multiple different combinations of control changes can yield the same Laplace transform, adding ambiguity to the causality from effects to the specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → X(T); N → X(T); u(t) → X(T); u'(t) → X(T); X(T) → M; X(T) → N; X(T) → u(t); X(T) → u'(t)"
