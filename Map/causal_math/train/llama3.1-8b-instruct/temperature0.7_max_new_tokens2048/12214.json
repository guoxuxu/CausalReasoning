  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\( D \\\\) being a constant matrix characterizing the system dynamics and \\\\( C \\\\) being the control matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) is defined, where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Gt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( G \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( D \\\\), and not on \\\\( F \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), further influencing how the initial transformations by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and subsequent dynamics dictated by \\\\( D \\\\) and control matrix \\\\( C \\\\) play out. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on the interplay between all these factors (\\\\( F \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\)).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
