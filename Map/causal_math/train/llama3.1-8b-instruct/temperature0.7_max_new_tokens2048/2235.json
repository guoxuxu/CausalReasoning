  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf a function modification characterized by a real shift transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is real is applied at some time before applying \\\\(T\\\\), will the characteristic frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) change in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the shift transformation results in the modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}z(t) = e^{at}e^{i\\\\omega t} = e^{(a + i\\\\omega)t} \\\\). When the Laplace transform is applied to this modified function, it yields \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - (a + i\\\\omega)}\\\\). While the location of the pole changes in the complex plane, the imaginary part, indicating the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), remains the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
