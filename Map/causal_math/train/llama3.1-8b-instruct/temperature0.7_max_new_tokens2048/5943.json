  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\(R(z) = Bz\\\\) where \\\\(B\\\\) is another complex constant matrix is applied at an intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the end state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on \\\\(\\omega\\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(R(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces components from matrix \\\\(B\\\\), which modifies the trajectory initiated by \\\\(A\\\\). The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is thus dependent on both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) in addition to the inherent parameters of the system such as \\\\(\\omega\\\\). The matrix interactions and their sequence play critical roles in determining the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
