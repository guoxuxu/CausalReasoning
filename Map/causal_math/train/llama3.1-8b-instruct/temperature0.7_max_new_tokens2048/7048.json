  "Problem": "We consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\), with M being a complex matrix. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the evolution, just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying interventions based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impractical due to the possible equivalence of several trajectories leading to the same endpoint. The interactions between the exponential impacts of N and L with M, and their sequence of applications, create a myriad of potential pathways that complicate backward determination of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
