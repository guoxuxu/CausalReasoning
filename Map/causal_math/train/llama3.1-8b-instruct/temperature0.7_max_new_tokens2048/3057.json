  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is given and evolves according to the PDE without any intervention, will the population distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be equivalent to that determined strictly by the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the diffusion process?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for any \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) is solely dependent on its initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the given diffusion equation without any external alteration, ensuring the dependence only on initial conditions as per the properties of diffusion PDEs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
