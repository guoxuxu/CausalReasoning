  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. We analyze the system under a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an arbitrary constant phase shift \\\\( e^{i \\phi} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the resulting frequency-domain representation \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) be affected solely by the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\), without influence from \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift \\\\( e^{i \\phi} \\\\) modifies the function by adding a constant phase to all components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This intervention shifts the spectrum in the frequency domain, affecting the phases of each frequency component, although not altering the magnitude spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
