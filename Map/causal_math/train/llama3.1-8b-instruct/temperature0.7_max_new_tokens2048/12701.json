  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) known as the Laplace Transform, on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex number.\n\nIf given the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\), can we recover the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the t-domain without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\), under the condition that \\\\( Re(s) > Re(A) \\\\), recovers \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\). There is a direct correspondence between specific forms of Laplace transformed functions and their originals in the t-domain, enabling exact recovery without further interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
