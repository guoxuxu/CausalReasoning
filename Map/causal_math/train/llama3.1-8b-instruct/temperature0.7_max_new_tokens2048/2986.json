  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was explicitly mentioned as being applied, knowing \\\\(U(k, T)\\\\) allows us to use the inverse Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) and to deduce the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) by solving the PDE backwards, assuming L is conducive to such operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
