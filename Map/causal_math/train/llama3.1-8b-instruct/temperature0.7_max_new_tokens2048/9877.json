  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constants. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system, where C is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given system without further intervention, does the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the original system for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) significantly alters the iniital state through multiplication by a complex exponential, thus affecting the trajectory. The evolution will combine effects from the complex factors \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and the dynamical system characteristics (A and B), leading to a different end state than the untransformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
