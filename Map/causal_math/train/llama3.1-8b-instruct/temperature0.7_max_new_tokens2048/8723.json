  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. We introduce the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is another constant matrix, to study how this affects the trajectories over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by D and not M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces new dynamics alongside M and D. The final state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is dependent on the interaction of matrices D, M, and N, owing to the fact that these matrices can alter the trajectory in unique ways. This effect is compounded since the exponentials of matrices do not generally commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
