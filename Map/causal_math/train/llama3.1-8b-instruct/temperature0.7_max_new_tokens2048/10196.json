  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}B u(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and u(t) is a control input. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform on the control signal u(t), denoted as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\), and its impact on the transformed system output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) after modifications to A and B, can we precisely identify what changes were made to these matrices or deduce the exact nature of the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple modifications to A and B can produce similar effects on the Laplace transformed output, making it challenging to uniquely reverse engineer the matrix changes or the specific nature of the interventions from \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) alone. The potential overlap in effects due to different matrix configurations complicates unique determination.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
