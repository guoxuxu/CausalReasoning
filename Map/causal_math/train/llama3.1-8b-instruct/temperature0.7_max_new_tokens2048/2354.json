  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = g(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix and x is a complex variable. We examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) in analyzing the system for various conditions.\n\nCan we infer the initial value \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 purely from the knowledge of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without explicit information about the matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) incorporates the exponential effects of M, and without knowing M, it is not feasible to correctly deduce the initial state \\\\( x \\\\) because different matrices could yield similar transformations influencing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
