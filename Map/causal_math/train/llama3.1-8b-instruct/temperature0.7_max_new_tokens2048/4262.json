  "Problem": "Consider a spatial domain in which the temperature distribution is represented by the complex function \\\\(T(z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is time. The initial temperature distribution is given by \\\\(T(z,0) = z^2\\\\). The transformation under consideration is a Laplace transformation applied over time and its inverse applied at a later time \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nFrom measurement of \\\\(T(z,T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), without knowing about the Laplace and inverse Laplace transformations, can one deduce the exact form of \\\\(T(z, 0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of the Laplace transform and its inverse, any transformation of the temporal component that impacts the solution cannot be accounted for. Recovering the initial state \\\\(T(z, 0)\\\\) accurately from \\\\(T(z,T)\\\\) without this knowledge is generally not feasible as transformations may introduce irreversible modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
