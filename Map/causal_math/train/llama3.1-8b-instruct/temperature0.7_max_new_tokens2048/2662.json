  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) obey the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with A, B, C, D being constants. We examine the impact of a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) at s = 0, can we uniquely determine the specific initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of the system or its evolution based solely on this transformed output?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform aggregates information across the entire time domain, leading to loss of specific time-domain data such as the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or the particular trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), as multiple different functions/times could lead to the same transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
