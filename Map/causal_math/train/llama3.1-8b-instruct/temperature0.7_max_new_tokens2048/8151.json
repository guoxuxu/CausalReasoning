  "Problem": "Examine the dynamic system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) dx \\\\) applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the differential operator to \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), keeping the same initial conditions, will the state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( L \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's dynamics partway through its evolution, causing the state at T to be influenced by both the original operator L and the intervening operator \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\). The Fourier transform of the state thus depends on the nature of both operators.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
