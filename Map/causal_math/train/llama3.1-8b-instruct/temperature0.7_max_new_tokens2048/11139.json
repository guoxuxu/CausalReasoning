  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional region. An external source modifies the boundary conditions at specific points through a function represented by \\\\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an additional boundary modifying function \\\\(w(x, y) = e^{-i\\\\omega(x+y)}\\\\) is applied at a later time t1, would the end state of \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at time t = T (T > t1) be unaffected by the initial function \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\(w(x, y)\\\\) at t1 will additively interfere with the initial condition set by \\\\(v(x, y)\\\\) due to the superpositional properties of solutions to the Laplace equation. The final form of \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at time T will reflect the influence of both boundary modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
