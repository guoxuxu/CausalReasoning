  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, which alters the representation to depend on frequency variables \\\\( \\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) observed in the frequency domain, can we precisely identify the type of intervention (original Fourier, followed by operator \\\\( M \\\\), or both) used, solely based on the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) in the frequency domain could result from different interventions and transformations. Due to their potential interactions and the loss of information about the sequence of applications, it's infeasible to uniquely backtrack and pinpoint precisely what transformations and interventions were executed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
