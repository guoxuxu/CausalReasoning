  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Stokes' theorem in a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\) over a manifold. The theorem states \\\\( \\\\int_{\\\\partial M} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\int_M (\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}) \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\). We explore how applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{F}(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\mathbf{F}(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) affects the relationship outlined by Stokes' theorem.\n\nGiven an endpoint data of the surface integral over manifold \\\\( M \\\\) after transformations and interventions, can we uniquely determine the sequence of transformations (Laplace or Fourier) used, or identify the original vector field based solely on this endpoint data?",
  "Explanation": "Given the compound effects of multiple transformations, the resultant data from surface integrals may correspond to multiple possible sequences of applying Laplace and Fourier transformations or different initial vector fields. The non-unique and overlapping effects of such transformations in altering the vector field properties and the integral outcomes make it infeasible to uniquely backtrack to the specific transformations or the original vector field without additional distinguishing information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
