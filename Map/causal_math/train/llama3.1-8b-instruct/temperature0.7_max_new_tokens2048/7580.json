  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. The analysis focuses on the consequences of integral transformations such as the Laplace transform on the time behavior of this system.\n\nBased on observing the function's behavior \\\\( w(T) \\\\) at a specific ending time point, can we accurately determine whether the function was subjected to additional transformations such as those described above, assuming all transformations were perfectly reversed?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the historical application of transformations just from the final observation of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is not possible if all transformations were perfectly reversed, as they would theoretically leave no traceable impact on the final state that could definitively indicate their prior application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
