  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We apply a Laplace transform on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and explore how the transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), behaves under different initial conditions and interventions with additional transformations.\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) without any further modification to the function, will the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = b + ai \\\\) (where \\\\( b, a \\\\) are real numbers) be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), assuming real part of \\\\( s \\\\) is greater than real part of \\\\( a \\\\). This result directly follows from the definition of the Laplace transform without any modifications to \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "applying Laplace transform → F(s) is defined; initial conditions → F(s) is affected; s = b + ai → F(s) is evaluated at specific point; z = 0 → F(s) is dependent on initial condition; a = b + ai → F(s) is dependent on complex constant; f(z) = e^{az} → F(s) is derived from; F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a} → is proposed transform of f(z)"
