  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. The system's behavior is further explored through the application of a transformation represented by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention using a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention introduces a new transformation affecting the system's evolution. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thereby depends on the initial modification by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), the system's intrinsic frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and the intervention by \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), complicating the trajectory and dependency on all three parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
