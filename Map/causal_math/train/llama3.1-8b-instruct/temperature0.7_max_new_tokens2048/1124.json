  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this function, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified Fourier transform result after unknown phase shift interventions, can we determine precisely the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the nature of the phase shifts \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift intervention modifies the spectral properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a way that is generally irreversible without additional information about \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\). Since the phase shift can vary with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), different phase shifts might yield the same final modified transform, making it infeasible to uniquely determine both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi(\\\\omega) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
