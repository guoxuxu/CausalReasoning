  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Mx + u\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix and \\(u\\) is a control input. We examine the influence of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\), with \\(N\\) being another constant matrix, on the system’s trajectory.\n\nGiven the final state \\( x(T) \\) under the dynamics \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\) without control, can we definitively determine if \\( h(x) \\) was applied initially at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( x(T) \\) is a result of the system's dynamics, potentially modified by both matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). Without additional information about the impact of \\( N \\) or the initial state derivatives over time, it is not possible to retroactively confirm the application of \\( h(x) \\) from \\( x(T) \\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
