  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nUsing knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively state whether transformations such as \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\) were applied, and in which sequence, solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of \\\\( alpha \\\\) and \\\\( beta \\\\) values, and different sequence timings for applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). The interplay between the exponential growth factors and the intrinsic rotations makes it ambiguous and non-trivial to unravel the exact interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
