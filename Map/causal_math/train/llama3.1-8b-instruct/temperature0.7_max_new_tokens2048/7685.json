  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement and c is the wave speed. The medium through which the wave travels undergoes a transformation defined by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is applied to the initial wave function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the wave equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "The damping transformation modifies the initial amplitude of the wave, thereby altering its evolution. The resultant wave at any time t will be exponentially attenuated compared to the non-transformed scenario, leading to a different displacement at any given point x at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
