  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=0 and is then allowed to evolve according to the complex function definition without any further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=T be different from the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) affects the evolution of the function over time. Initially, \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), but after applying the transformation and continuing without intervention, the transformation accumulates the effect of the integral of \\\\( e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\\\), which alters the result from the simply evolving \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
