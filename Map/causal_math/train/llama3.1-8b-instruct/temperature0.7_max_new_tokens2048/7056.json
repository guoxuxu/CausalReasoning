  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. We explore the impact of the integral transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), applied at time t.\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the presence and exact formation of transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) used, by solely examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexities introduced by potential overlapping effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), each integrating the function over different time periods and possibly influencing the outcome in non-distinctive ways, obfuscate any definitive reverse engineering from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) back to the specifics of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\). The compounded effects and possible interdependencies between \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\) make it impossible to ascertain their individual impacts precisely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
