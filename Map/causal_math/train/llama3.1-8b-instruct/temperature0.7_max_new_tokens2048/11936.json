  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform without any modification or intervention, will its transformed state at frequency \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\) be exclusively determined by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), i.e., \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\xi - \\\\omega) \\\\). The transformation is uniquely determined by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), showing a peak exactly at the function's oscillation frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
