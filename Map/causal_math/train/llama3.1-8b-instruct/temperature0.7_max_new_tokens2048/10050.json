  "Problem": "In a study of fluid dynamics, let \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid on a plane, subject to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\). We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x,t)dx \\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed field \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, T) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the initial field \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) using an inverse Fourier transform without knowing the specific initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform reconstructs the spatial structure at time T, but losses about phases or certain harmonic components altered by the dynamics might prevent accurate reversion to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), unless very specific properties of the PDE are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "initial field u(x,0) → velocity field u(x,t); velocity field u(x,t) → Fourier transform F(u)(k,t); Fourier transform F(u)(k,t) → F(u)(k,T); F(u)(k,T) → initial field u(x,0) via inverse Fourier transform"
