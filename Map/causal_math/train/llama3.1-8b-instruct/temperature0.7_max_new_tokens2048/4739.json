  "Problem": "We consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) where A is a constant matrix. The system is subjected to an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nAssuming a secondary transform \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^{t} e^{C\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the properties of A without considering the impacts of B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) as a secondary transformation influences the system's further evolution, impacting the state at T. This intervention modifies the system's development by integrating the effect of another matrix exponential, making the end state reliant on A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
