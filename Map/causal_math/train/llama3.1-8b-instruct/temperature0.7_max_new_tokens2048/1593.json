  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the Laplace transform of its impulse response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The behavior of the circuit is impacted by alternating the parameters of its elements, such as resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C). Let's analyze how variations in these parameters, modeled as a complex function \\\\\\( f(R, L, C) = RLCs^2 + (R+L)s + C \\\\\\), influence the overall impulse response over time domain, represented by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\\\( H(s) \\\\\\).\n\nIf the values of R, L, and C are set to new values at t = 0 and the circuit is then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the impulse response of the circuit at t = T be the same as if R, L, and C were kept at their initial settings?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the values of R, L, or C modifies the function \\\\\\( f(R, L, C) \\\\\\), and thus also alters the Laplace domain representation \\\\\\( H(s) \\\\\\), changing the dynamic behavior of the circuit. The impulse response in the time domain, being the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\\\( H(s) \\\\\\), will consequently differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
