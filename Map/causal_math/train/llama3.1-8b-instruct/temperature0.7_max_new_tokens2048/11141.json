  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We evaluate the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(w) \\\\) in a path where \\\\( w \\\\) encircles the origin, will the value of the transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) remain the same as if the path did not encircle the origin?",
  "Explanation": "Encircling the origin changes the values of \\\\( w^n \\\\) due to the multi-valued nature of the power function with complex exponent. The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will yield different results due to changes in the integration path, affecting how the exponential decay influences the power function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
