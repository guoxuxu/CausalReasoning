  "Problem": "Assume a system defined by the integral equation \\\\( y = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) a time-varying vector function. We further explore the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to analyze this system, shifting a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\) to observe causal relationships.\n\nIf an intervention by an operator, say a multiplication with a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) in the s-domain, is applied at a specific Laplace variable \\\\( s_0 \\\\), will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) for all \\\\( s \\\\) still directly correspond to the original system defined by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the s-domain system, altering the relationship by multiplying \\\\( X(s) \\\\) or \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) with \\\\( M \\\\). This modifies the equivalence between the Laplace-transformed output and the original integral equation, especially at and around the point of intervention \\\\( s_0 \\\\), although it could potentially influence all points depending on \\\\( M \\\\) and the nature of \\\\( s_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
