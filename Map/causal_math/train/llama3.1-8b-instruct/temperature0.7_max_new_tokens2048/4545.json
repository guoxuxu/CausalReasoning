  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We explore the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\\\\\((\\\\mathcal{L})\\\\) on this function with respect to its coefficients \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\alpha u(t) + \\\\beta v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the coefficients \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are adjusted at time t = 0 and the function evolves under its original dynamics without further changes, will changes in the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) linearly reflect changes made to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a linear transformation. Changes to the coefficients \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) in the time domain linearly reflect in the transform domain. Therefore, adjustments to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) directly scale the terms in the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), reflecting proportional changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
