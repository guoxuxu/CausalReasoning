  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(p\\\\) is a control function. The system's transformation is analyzed using the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the exact time-profile of \\\\( p(t) \\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))\\\\) without other system details?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, being an integral transform, generally loses certain time-specific information about the function it transforms, such as localized variations in p(t). Without additional conditions or data about the operator L or initial conditions, reconstructing p(t) from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))\\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
