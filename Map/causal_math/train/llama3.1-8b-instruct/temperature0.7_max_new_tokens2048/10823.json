  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another operation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the final state after the operation depend only on the original differential equation and not on the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) imposes an additional transformation based on a different frequency component (twice the original). The outcome depends on the interaction between the original signal, the differential equation, and the new transformation applied, reflecting changes in the frequency domain characteristics as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
