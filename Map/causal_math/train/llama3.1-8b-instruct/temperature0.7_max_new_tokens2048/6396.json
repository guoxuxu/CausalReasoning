  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), involving a complex matrix F, is applied at different instances.\n\nCan we precisely identify the transformations used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), multiple scenarios involving different combinations and timings of applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) can lead to the same final state due to the complex nature of matrix exponentials potentially overlapping in effects. This ambiguity means exact interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
