  "Problem": "Analyze a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. The system's state is manipulated by a transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\), where D is a matrix. The manipulation occurs over time t and has implications for the evolution of the state.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\), \\\\( k(u) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations used to reach \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is challenging without additional data. Different combinations of applying \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) can yield similar endpoints due to the transformations' convoluted effects, making it difficult to uniquely identify the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
