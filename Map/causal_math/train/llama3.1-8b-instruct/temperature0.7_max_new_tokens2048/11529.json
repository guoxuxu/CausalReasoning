  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nIf the integral of \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is taken along a simple path from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\) without any pathway changes, will the resultant value change if the path's parameterization is altered but still connects \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral's result depends only on the endpoints and the function's nature, not on the specific parameterization of the path due to the path-independence in the analytic nature of the function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
