  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{sL + R}} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) represent the resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. We investigate the impact of applying a Laplace transform to the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), and its effect on the system’s output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf we apply the transformed input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) to the circuit, given the impedance function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), and generate the output \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot Z(s) \\\\), will the output in the Laplace domain correlate directly to the expected output if the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was fed into an identical circuit governed by \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) calculated via \\\\( X(s) \\\\cdot Z(s) \\\\) reflects the exact influence of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) when transformed input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is applied, matching the behavior of the circuit when \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is applied directly and similarly transformed. The nature of linear time-invariant systems guarantees this correlation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
