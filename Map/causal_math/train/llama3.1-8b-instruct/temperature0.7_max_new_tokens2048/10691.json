  "Problem": "Evaluate the relationship between a Fourier transform given by the equation \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) and its impact on the system's behavior described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + a\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + bu = f(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the differential equation at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) reflect only changes due to the new \\\\( a \\\\) value and not be influenced by transformations applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will reflect both the history of the system (including any transformations to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)), and the immediate effects of the changed value of \\\\( a \\\\). Both the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the parameters of the equation influence the resultant behavior of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
