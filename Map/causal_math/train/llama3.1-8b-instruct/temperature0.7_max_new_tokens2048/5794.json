  "Problem": "Suppose there is a function \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + x \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) where x represents space and t represents time. An intervention \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is defined as \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t)\\\\), with \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) being solutions to another set of PDEs.\n\nGiven the function \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we uniquely identify the initial conditions \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, 0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combination of initial conditions leading to a specific \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) is not unique without additional information on the separate functions \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\), especially if they are not linearly independent or integrated differently across spatial variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
