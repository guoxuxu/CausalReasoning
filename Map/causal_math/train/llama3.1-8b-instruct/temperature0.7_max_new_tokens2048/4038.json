  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is to be considered.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied, deriving the exact original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is not feasible because both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( -z_0 \\\\) can result in the same observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given the squaring operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
