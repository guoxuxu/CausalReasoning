  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a complex function of a spatial variable. We investigate how the application of Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\), impacts the causal inference of effects in this system.\n\nKnowing the state at \\\\(T\\\\) following interventions and transformations, can we unequivocally deduce the precise nature and sequence of transformations and interventions applied throughout?",
  "Explanation": "Due to possible overlapping effects of the linear transformations and the general properties of complex functions influencing each other, distinguishing between effects solely based on the final state at \\\\(T\\\\) becomes non-trivial and ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
