  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of modifying \\\\( s \\\\) and using an intervention function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\( S(z') \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformation (original or intervention) influenced the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T > t_1, only using the observed data of \\\\( S(z') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both the original transformation and the intervention modify the signal in non-trivial ways that potentially overlap in the integral transformation, it's challenging to attribute effects to specific causes without ambiguity. Different signals and transformations can lead to similar observed outcomes in \\\\( S(z') \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
