  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex constant, on the evolution and behavior of this system.\n\nIf we introduce a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a complex constant) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) as an intervention affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of the combined effects of A, B, and C. The interplay between these transformations via the integrals of their respective matrix exponentials modifies the evolution significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
