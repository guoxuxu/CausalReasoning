  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{-\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) directly counters the effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), but the history of transformations affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the earlier effect of \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) and the later counter-effect, the trajectory and final state are influenced by both parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
