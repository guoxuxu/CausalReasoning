  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nIf a manipulation \\(h(t) = f(t) + k(t)\\) (where \\(k(t)\\) is another known function) is applied to \\(f(t)\\) before using the time-scaling \\(g(t) = h(\\\\alpha t)\\), does the Laplace Transform solely depend on the original function \\(f(t)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\(h(t)\\) adds another function \\(k(t)\\) to \\(f(t)\\) before scaling, so the result \\( L(g)(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain will depend on both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(k(t)\\), influenced by their algebraic sum and the scaling factor \\(\\\\alpha\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
