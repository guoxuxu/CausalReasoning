  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nIs it feasible to reconstruct the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at every point t from 0 to T by solely observing the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency parameter \\\\( w \\\\) critically influences the transformation such that without knowing \\\\( w \\\\), the phase shift imposed by \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) cannot be decoupled accurately, making it impossible to retrieve \\\\( x(t) \\\\) exactly from \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
