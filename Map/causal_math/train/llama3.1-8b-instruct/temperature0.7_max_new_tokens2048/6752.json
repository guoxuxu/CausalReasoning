  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where x and y are real variables, and i is the imaginary unit. This system is subjected to the transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of the system is analyzed in a scenario where transformations are applied and the system evolves over time.\n\nGiven the final observable state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine whether \\\\( G(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or a combination of both were applied, based solely on the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The similar effects caused by exponential transformations in the complex plane can result in indistinguishable outcomes for different initial applications (either \\\\( G(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both). The overlap in effects makes it impossible to determine the interventions precisely from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
