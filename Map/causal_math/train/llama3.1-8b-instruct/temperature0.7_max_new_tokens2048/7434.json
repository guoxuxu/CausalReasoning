  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)dt \\\\), and its inverse on the system's behavior.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) perfectly at t = 0 after observing the transformed system behavior at time T given \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) without knowing whether the Laplace transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The loss of information about initial or intermediate states due to transformation attributes and possible modifications through L makes it uncertain to precisely revert to \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the transformation and original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
