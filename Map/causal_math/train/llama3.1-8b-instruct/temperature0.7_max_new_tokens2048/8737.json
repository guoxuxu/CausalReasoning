  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), with constants a and b. We investigate how transformations like \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) affect this system, where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the system's differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the system's equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) = e^{C \\\\cdot 0} z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but the evolution thereafter is influenced by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) which affects both the magnitude and the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a different trajectory compared to the untransformed system.",
