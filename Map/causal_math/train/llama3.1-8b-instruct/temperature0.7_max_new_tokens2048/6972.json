  "Problem": "Let's examine the interplay between two complex functions, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{-iωt} \\\\), in the context of a complex plane traversal. The complex exponentials represent rotation dynamics in the complex plane, with \\\\( ω \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nGiven the system's state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the intervention (switch to \\\\( w(t) \\\\)) took place, if all we know is the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could reflect various intervention scenarios or none at all, due to the periodic nature of the exponential functions on the unit circle. The ambiguity arises from the fact that different trajectories can converge to the same point without a unique determination of path history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
