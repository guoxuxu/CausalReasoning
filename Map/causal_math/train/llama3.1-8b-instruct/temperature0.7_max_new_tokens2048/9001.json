  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the complex variable. Determine how transformations by function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) at specific instances influence the behavior of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) over the complex plane.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at z = 0 modify the evolution of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) under its inherent dynamics as z moves away from the origin?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at z = 0 changes the function to \\\\( e^{Bz}e^{Az} \\\\) which is generally not the same as \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) unless A and B commute. Hence, the trajectory of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) on the complex plane is altered from the original by this initial transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
