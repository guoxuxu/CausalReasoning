  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, C is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We examine the impact of transformation \\\\( h(z) = De^{iBt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is a complex constant matrix and B is another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by the transformation \\\\( De^{iB0}z_0 = Dz_0 \\\\. The matrix D can lead to an eigenvalue scaling or a rotation, depending on its structure, which modifies the overall evolution making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different from the state arrived by just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( Ce^{iAt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
