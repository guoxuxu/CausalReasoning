  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit RLC series where \\\\(R, L, C\\\\) represent resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. Let the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be a sinusoidal function described by \\\\(V(t) = V_0 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\) where \\\\(V_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. Investigate how the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) changes when subjected to the Laplace transform, which encodes different input conditions or interventions.\n\nIf the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is changed from one sinusoidal function with frequency \\\\(\\\\omega_1\\\\) to another with frequency \\\\(\\\\omega_2\\\\) at time t = 0, will the resulting output current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) precisely reflect just the change in frequency \\\\(\\\\omega_2\\\\) by time T?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the frequency of the input voltage alters the entire system response due to the frequency-dependent impedance of the RLC circuit. The current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) reflects changes in the impedance components (reactance and resistance) and is cumulatively affected by the system's transient and steady state response to the new frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
