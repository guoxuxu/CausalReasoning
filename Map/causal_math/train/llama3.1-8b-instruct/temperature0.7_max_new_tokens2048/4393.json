  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), on the evolution of the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(x_0)\\\\) is applied to the initial state at t = 0 and then the system evolves by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\) without further manipulation, would the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to what would result if \\\\(x_0\\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the frequency components of \\\\(x_0\\\\), potentially altering the initial conditions and hence the trajectory under the linear operator L. This can lead to a significantly different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
