  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an external function \\\\( v(t) \\\\), defined in terms of another complex variable, is introduced as a control parameter at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the interactions of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) with \\\\( k \\\\), disregarding the Laplacian's effect?",
  "Explanation": "The system's response to the intervention \\\\( v(t) \\\\) would still be affected by the spatial dependencies and diffusion characteristics governed by \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) results from a complex interaction of \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\), and the newly introduced \\\\( v(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
