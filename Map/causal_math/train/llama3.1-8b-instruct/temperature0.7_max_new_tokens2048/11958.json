  "Problem": "Consider a control system where temperature regulation is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We study the effect of a sudden shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) modeled by the function \\\\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\\\), where \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside step function, and \\\\( S \\\\) is a constant shift.\n\nIf, after the shift in \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a cooling system intervenes to enforce a constant temperature, will the final operational temperature depend only on the settings of the cooling system, regardless of \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the cooling system overpowers the natural system dynamics and environmental influences. Hence, the final temperature is dependent solely on the cooling system's set temperature, irrespective of \\\\( S \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
