  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, describing an oscillator in the complex plane. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, applied at different times.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), due to the nature of exponential growth and its dependency on the time and constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Different parameters and timings could result in the same or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\), especially without knowing the exact values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or the initial state.",
