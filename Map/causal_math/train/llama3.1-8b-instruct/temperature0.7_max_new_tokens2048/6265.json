  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}u \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex constant vector. This function is acted upon by a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) = u \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial state for the dynamics, resulting in \\\\( z(0) = Cu \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t will change from \\\\( e^{iAt}u \\\\) to \\\\( e^{iAt}Cu \\\\). The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) combined with \\\\( C \\\\) can change the original dynamics substantially, leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
