  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant real number, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) the initial complex value. We are interested in studying the effect of applying the linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant real number.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied based only on knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations from the endpoint alone is not feasible due to the overlapping effects of multiple possible exponential modifications (resulting from \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\)). These transformations can produce equivalent endpoints from different initial actions and parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
