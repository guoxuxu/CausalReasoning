  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely the sequence of transformations applied (whether \\\\(g(x)\\\\) at t = 0, \\\\(h(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\), or both) to reach this endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\(x(T)\\\\) may correspond to multiple possible transformation sequences due to the similarities in how exponential scaling interacts with the harmonic oscillator. This similarity makes it impossible to uniquely determine whether one or both transformations were applied, or in which sequence, based solely on the final position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
