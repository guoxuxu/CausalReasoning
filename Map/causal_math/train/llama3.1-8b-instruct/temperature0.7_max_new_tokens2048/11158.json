  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nCan the original function \\( z_0(t) \\) be deduced from observing \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing the parameter \\( s \\) in \\( T(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the complex parameter \\( s \\), the contribution of \\( e^{-st} \\) to the integration cannot be accurately reversed, hence \\( z_0(t) \\) cannot be uniquely reconstructed from \\( T(z(t)) \\) at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
