  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a complex function space defined by \\\\( L(f)(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation is the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\). The causal analysis investigates the role played by the parameter \\\\( z \\\\) in the transformed function and how it affects the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function from the Laplace transform, can we accurately determine the value of \\\\( z \\\\) that was used without additional conditions or knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of a Laplace transform by itself, without knowledge of boundary conditions or the behavior of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at infinity, does not uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( z \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( z \\\\) could potentially produce similar transformations dependent on the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
