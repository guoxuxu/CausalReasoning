  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(X) = X e^{Dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent solely on \\\\( A \\\\), not on \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) will depend on transformations involving all matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\). The interventions \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) fundamentally alter the dynamics introduced by the volatility component \\\\( B \\\\) as well as the drift component \\\\( A \\\\), affecting the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
