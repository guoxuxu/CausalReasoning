  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constants. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system, where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or neither), solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be achieved from various combinations or sequences of interventions, due to complex exponential effects and their overlapping influences. The endpoint in the complex case does not provide a unique signature of preceding transformations, leading to ambiguities in back-tracing the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
