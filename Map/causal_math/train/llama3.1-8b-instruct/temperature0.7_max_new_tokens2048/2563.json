  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function is subject to transformations using Fourier transforms over time.\n\nIf the system is intervened with another function \\\\( w(t) = e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) at time t = t_1 by multiplying, will the function at time T > t_1 be the simple product of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) without considering their individual transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of these exponential functions results in their frequencies being added, resulting in a transformed function with a frequency of \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\beta \\\\). Therefore, their interaction creates a new frequency component which isn't a trivial product of the two functions at time T but instead follows the combined behavior of their frequency sums.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
