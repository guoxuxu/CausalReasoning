  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the scenario where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) can drastically alter the trajectory by incorporating the integrated effect of the complex exponential term \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) into the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This fundamentally shifts the state of the function from what would have occurred solely under \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
