  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) within a domain. We explore the influence of boundary conditions altering the function \\\\(u\\\\) through an integral transformation \\\\(T[u] = \\\\int_D k(x,y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\(k(x, y)\\\\) is a kernel modifying \\\\(u\\\\) along the boundary \\\\(D\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T[u]\\\\) is applied to modify the boundary conditions at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then \\\\(u\\\\) evolves according to \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same if no transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) modifies the initial boundary conditions, which affect the solutions of the Laplace equation. Since the Laplace equation is sensitive to boundary changes, the evolution of \\\\(u\\\\) will diverge from that of an unmodified condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
