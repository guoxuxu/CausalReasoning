  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of a fluid flow which density ρ at a point (x, y, z) in space varies over time. The flow is defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. An intervention is modeled by a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(-kt) \\\\), with k being a positive constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original density \\\\( \\\\rho_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\rho(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\), the transformation involving the exponential decay makes it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( \\\\rho_0 \\\\) as the same observed density distribution at t = T could result from various initial conditions altered by different k values.",
