  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), typically representing a harmonic oscillator. We study the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial velocity condition \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf a new initial condition manipulation, represented as a Laplace transform \\\\( L(v_1) \\\\) where \\\\( v_1 \\\\) is a modified velocity, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting displacement \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on k and not on the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a Laplace transform modifies the velocity's spectral components again, influencing the displacement trajectory under the harmonic potential. The resulting displacement depends on all transformations (Fourier and Laplace) applied, and not solely on the harmonic constant \\\\( k \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
