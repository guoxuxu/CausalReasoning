  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nSuppose at a time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\beta t}z(t_1) \\) (introducing a new frequency \\( \\beta \\)). Will \\( T(z) \\) at \\( s \\) afterwards depend strictly on \\( \\omega \\) rather than \\( \\beta \\) or \\( z(t_1) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\), incorporating effects of \\( \\beta \\) and the state at \\( t_1 \\). Since \\( T(z) \\) integrates over all times, both pre- and post-intervention dynamics (i.e., influenced by \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\beta \\)) will contribute to the outcome, affecting the integral transform result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
