  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a complex number matrix and z is a complex variable. The function is applied in a system undergoing transformation by a linear operator represented by matrix B. We evaluate the relationship between the application of complex function and how the system evolves over time.\n\nConsidering the final state at \\\\(z = Z\\\\), can we precisely identify which transformations (either \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or both) were applied by only knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear and complex nature of the transformations involved, multiple sequences of applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and/or \\\\(g(z)\\\\) can lead to the same result at \\\\(Z\\\\). This overlap in potential evolutionary paths under the influence of non-commuting transformations means that interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
