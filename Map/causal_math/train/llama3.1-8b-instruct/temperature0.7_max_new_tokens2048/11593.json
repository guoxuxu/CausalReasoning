  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) and a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) applied to vector \\\\( v \\\\) in Euclidean space. Matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is constant, and the Fourier transform operates on function space representations of \\\\( v \\\\).\n\nIf the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\) is applied first and then the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\), is the result identical to applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) first and then transforming the result by some matrix \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation of a linearly transformed vector (or function) is generally not equivalent to any linear transformation of the Fourier transform of the vector due to the properties of Fourier transforms related to convolutions and shift. The relationship between \\\\( M \\\\) and the Fourier transform typically requires more complex interactions, such as modulation or convolution with a distribution, not simply another linear transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Matrix M → Linear Transformation T(v); Linear Transformation T(v) → Vector v; Fourier Transform → Vector v; Vector v → Function space representation; Matrix N → Linear Transformation (result of F(v)); Linear Transformation (result of F(v)) → Vector v; Function space representation → Fourier Transform"
