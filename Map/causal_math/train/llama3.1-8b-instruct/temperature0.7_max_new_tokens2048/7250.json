  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and C is a real constant. The function undergoes an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after transformation and evolution from 0 to T, can we deduce the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) integrates past behaviors of the system that have been modified, which obscures the original conditions. Without knowing the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\), the reverse calculation to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot uniquely determine whether the transformation was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
