  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) given by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z^t \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the implications of varying the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) in the function and its effect on the transformation of input complex number \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) is increased, does it necessarily lead to a decrease in the magnitude of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) for a fixed \\\\(z\\\\) with |z| > 1?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\(s\\\\) makes the exponential term \\\\(e^{-st}\\\\) decay faster, thus decreasing the integral's overall contribution when |z| > 1. This causes the magnitude of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) to generally decrease, reflecting tighter bounds on the growth of the function due to the increased decay rate induced by a larger \\\\(s\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
