  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nIf the initial expression \\\\( z(x, 0) = e^{ax} \\\\) is evolved over time to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the given complex function without any intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, T)\\\\} \\\\) still only depend on \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) at any time \\\\( T \\\\) results in a function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), which is independent of \\\\( T \\\\) because the dependency on \\\\( t \\\\) is accounted for in the transform and reflected in the denominator \\\\( s - b \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
