  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem where the velocity field of the fluid, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,t) \\\\), is manipulated through transformations \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\nabla \\\\psi \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a scalar potential function varying with spatial coordinates and time. The fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations under incompressible flow conditions.\n\nKnowing the fluid state at t = T, can we precisely determine what transformations were applied at earlier times, given the potential applications of \\\\( f \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\) or neither?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the reversible and often complex interactions in fluid dynamics and the sensitivity to initial conditions and interventions predicted by the chaos theory in systems like those governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, it is typically impossible to uniquely backtrack the specific transformations applied from the final state without additional information about the sequence and nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t = T → fluid state; f → fluid state; g → fluid state; fluid state → velocity field (v); fluid state → potential function (ψ); velocity field (v) → Navier-Stokes equations; Navier-Stokes equations → incompressible flow conditions; incompressible flow conditions → fluid state; ψ → f; f → v; f → fluid state; g → fluid state; ψ → g; g → v; g → fluid state"
