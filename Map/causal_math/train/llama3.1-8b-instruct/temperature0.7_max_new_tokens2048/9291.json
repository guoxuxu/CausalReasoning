  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{(iBt)}z\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant, on the behavior of the function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{(iCt)}z \\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the state by introducing another transformation defined by \\\\(C\\\\). As a result, the final state depends on the interplay and collective influence of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\). The transformations through \\\\(e^{iBt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{iCt}\\\\) contribute to a different trajectory and final position of \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
