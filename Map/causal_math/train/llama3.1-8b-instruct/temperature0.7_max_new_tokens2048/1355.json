  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates over time. We study the effect of a Laplace Transform \\\\( F(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(p) \\\\) which transforms the complex-valued function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf an external sinusoidal force \\\\( f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing both its amplitude and phase, will this intervention be clearly identifiable in the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\), distinct from intrinsic characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the sinusoidal force introduces new frequency components to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which are distinctly captured in \\\\( F(p) \\\\) by additional poles and zeros at the corresponding frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). These changes in \\\\( F(p) \\\\) help in identifying the impact of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
