  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the effect of performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and k represents the transformed spatial variable.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the transformed function \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, 0) \\\\) evolves over time according to the transformed equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\tilde{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\tilde{L}\\\\tilde{u} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) is the operator L in the Fourier space, will the evolved \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) \\\\) correspond to the Fourier transform of the state \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) evolved under the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the original PDE converts the differential operator L into its Fourier space representation \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\). Thus, the evolution of the transformed state \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, 0) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) indeed corresponds to the Fourier transform of the state evolved under L in the original space.",
