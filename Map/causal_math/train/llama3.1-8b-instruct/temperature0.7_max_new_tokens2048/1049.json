  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\), where D is the diffusion constant. Consider the effect of applying a transformation using a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), which alters the initial condition by a function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the transform space.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is applied at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) without further intervention, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time t = T match the untransformed system starting from the same initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the initial conditions in the transform space, influencing the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the diffusion equation. The transformed initial condition changes the solution path due to alterations in the frequency components of the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation of z(t) → Change in initial condition; Change in initial condition → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → z(t) evolution under PDE; z(t) evolution under PDE → z(t) at t = T"
