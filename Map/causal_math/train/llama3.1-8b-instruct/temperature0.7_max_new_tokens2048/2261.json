  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve up to time T without further transformation, will the function retain the form of \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alters the function significantly due to the integral, resulting in a function that no longer strictly represents the original exponential waveform. The effect of the transformation accumulates over the interval, changing the nature of the function compared to its initial form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
