  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) with \\( \\lambda > 0 \\), and consider the transformation \\( T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t} \\) applied to \\( u \\).\n\nIf \\( T(u) \\) is applied to \\( u(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) without further intervention, will \\( T(u)(x, t) \\) at t = T exactly represent \\( u(x, T) \\) under the original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(u) \\) modifies the initial state of the system to \\( u(x, 0)e^{-\\lambda 0} = u(x, 0) \\), which still evolves but under the unmodified dynamics. The function \\( T(u) \\) essentially creates an equilibrium state but does not align with the dynamics governed by \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u \\) over time, unless \\( t=0 \\), hence the states will differ for \\( t > 0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
