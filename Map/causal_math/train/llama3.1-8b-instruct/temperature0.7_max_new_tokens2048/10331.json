  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. Consider a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-iwx} u(x) dx\\\\) being applied as a transformation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\(u(t_1, x)\\\\) at some intermediate time t_1 and then the results are fed into the heat equation until time T > t_1, will the end temperature distribution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) only be governed by the original heat equation constant k and not influenced by the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediate application of the Fourier transform alters the condition of the system in frequency space, possibly emphasizing certain frequencies which behave differently under the heat equation. Hence, the final state at time T will carry traces of this transformation, making the output reliant on both k and the effect of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
