  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate how transformations defined by the integral transformation \\\\(T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\alpha s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with constant \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), affect the function over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after both transformations, can we establish definitively whether it was the effect of \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant function at t = T after applying both transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\) cannot uniquely determine the specific contributions of each, because both transformations might produce similar effects over varying intervals and parameters. The overlapping influences of these transformations make it impossible to attribute the final outcome to one specific intervention without more data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
