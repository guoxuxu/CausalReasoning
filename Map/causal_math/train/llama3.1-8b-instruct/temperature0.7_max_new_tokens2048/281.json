  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time and i is the imaginary unit. This function describes a unit circle in the complex plane. We study the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) where A is a complex number, representing multiplication and rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be a simple rotation around the unit circle as if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) affects the initial position on the complex plane. The trajectory then evolves from this new initial point, thereby affecting the entire subsequent path. The final position at any time T will be \\\\( A e^{iT} \\\\), not \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), adding a rotation and possible scaling depending on A.",
