  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex number. Analyze the causality and effects of modifying the function by a multiplicative factor \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and the nature of the intervention \\\\( m(t) = e^{pt} \\\\), can we uniquely determine if the initial transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation with its exponential decay nature and possible compensations between k and p make it challenging to unequivocally conclude the presence of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and knowledge of p. Different combinations of k and p can lead to the same result, introducing ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
