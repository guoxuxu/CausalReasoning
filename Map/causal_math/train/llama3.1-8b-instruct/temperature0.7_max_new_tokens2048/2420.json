  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + p\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(p\\\\) is a control function. The system's transformation is analyzed using the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))\\\\) at a high enough value of s, can we conclusively determine whether the intervention with q(t) was utilized, assuming the original p(t) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap of effects from p and q in the transformed domain, especially for a generalized operator L, implies multiple potential combinations of p and q leading to similar transformations in the Laplace domain. High s values in Laplace transform primarily dampen slower components, obscuring distinctions between initial and intervention-induced effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
