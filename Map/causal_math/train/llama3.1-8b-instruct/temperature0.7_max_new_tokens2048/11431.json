  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nSuppose a phase shifting operation \\\\( z(t) \\\\to e^{i\\\\theta}z(t) \\\\) is applied at some time t = 1, will the spectrum at time T > 1 show influence only from the original transformation and ignore the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) alters the phase but not the frequency of the signal. The Fourier spectrum will still depict the same frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) but the phase information will differ reflecting the intervention. Hence, both the original transformation and the intervention influence the final spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
