  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), described by the equation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-P} \\\\) where P is a complex constant. The integrative effect of a modification function \\\\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\\\) applied at time t=0 is analyzed, where k is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( v(t) \\\\), \\\\( w(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the transformed function at any s?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\\\) can be influenced by multiple, non-exclusive interventions due to the modification effects of powers of t (either m or k or both). The overlap in possible transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by different powers makes it impossible to uniquely backtrack and identify which intervention(s) were applied from the s-domain perspective.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
