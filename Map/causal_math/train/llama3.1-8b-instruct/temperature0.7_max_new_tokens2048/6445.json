  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\) represents the transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The impact of a linear operator \\\\( A \\\\) acting on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(t) = A f(t) \\\\) is being analyzed, where the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( A \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) transforming it to \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed, will \\\\( G(s) \\\\) always match the operation of \\\\( A \\\\) applied directly to \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( A \\\\) when applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and transformed to the s-domain may not necessarily match \\\\( A \\\\) operating directly on \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The properties of the Laplace transform and the specific action of \\\\( A \\\\) on time-domain functions can lead to different outcomes in s-domain, making \\\\( G(s) \\\\) distinct in general.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
