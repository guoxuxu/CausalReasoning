  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. We assess the implications of applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then transforming back, over time t.\n\nIf a modification is made to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the Laplace domain (by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\)) before transforming it back to the time domain, will this affect the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention in the Laplace domain by multiplying with \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), which might correspond to different drawable trajectories in the s-plane, alters the properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when transformed back to the time domain. This change will persistently affect the evolution of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), rendering it different from its path without the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
