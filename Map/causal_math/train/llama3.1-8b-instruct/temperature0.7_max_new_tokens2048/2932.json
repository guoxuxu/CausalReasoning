  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants determining the growth rate in two different components x and y, respectively, as functions of time t.\n\nGiven the composition of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after intervention \\\\( L \\\\), can we deduce the specific nature of the intervention (values of k) and the initial conditions (\\\\( x_0 \\\\), \\\\( y_0 \\\\)) solely from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the growth rates A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is shaped by the interplay between the initial conditions, the growth rates, and the intervention's properties. Without explicit knowledge of how the initial conditions were transformed by the intervention, and given the exponential influence of time through A and B, reconstructing specific details about k, \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) entails high ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
