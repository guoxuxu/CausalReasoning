  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix, and relate its transformations to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\}(s) \\\\) and its inverse. We assess scenarios when intervening by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) for another constant matrix \\\\( B \\\\).\n\nIf at some point \\\\( z = Z \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{BZ} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > Z \\\\) solely rely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the preceding state by transforming it with \\\\( e^{BZ} \\\\). Hence, the resultant state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > Z \\\\) is derived from both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) due to the compounded effect of the matrices, affecting the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
