  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. The impact of the Laplace transform on this function is analyzed over a variable \\\\(s\\\\) in the complex domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the matrix A without knowing the initial form of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\(F(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}\\\\) provides a direct relationship, inverting this to obtain A is typically not unique due to possible similar matrices that could yield the same transform. Thus, without knowing the specific form of \\\\(f(z)\\\\), A cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
