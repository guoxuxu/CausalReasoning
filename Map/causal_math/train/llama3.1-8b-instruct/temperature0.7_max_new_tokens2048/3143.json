  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), resulting in the partial differential equation \\\\( Lu = 0 \\\\). We investigate the system's response to a mapping defined by \\\\( v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)] \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) represents a Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where a new function \\\\( s(x) \\\\) is added to \\\\( v(x,t_1) \\\\) before continuing the evolution, will the final state \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) be dependent solely on the operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the nature of \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( s(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added function \\\\( s(x) \\\\) introduces another variable into the system that can modify the overall behavior along with the impact of the Fourier transform and the dynamics driven by \\\\( L \\\\). The final state is influenced by the interaction of these components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
