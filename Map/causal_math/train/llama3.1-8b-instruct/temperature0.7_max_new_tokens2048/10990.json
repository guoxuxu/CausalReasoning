  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) - By(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y}(t) = Bx(t) + Ay(t) \\\\), with A and B being constants. Let's examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\), given that the initial phase and magnitude changes introduced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) cannot be distinguished from the effects of the differential equations alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
