  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a diagonalizable matrix. We introduce an operator transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is another matrix, and analyze its effect on the system over a period of time t.\n\nIf we apply a new transformation \\\\( G(x) = Bx \\\\) (where B is a constant matrix) as an intervention at time t1, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend only on M and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations followed by matrix exponential evolution makes the final state dependent on all three matrices A, B, and M. The state evolves first under A, then is modified by \\\\( e^{M(t1)} \\\\), transformed by B, and finally evolves under \\\\( e^{M(T-t1)} \\\\), leading to a dependency on all of the matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
