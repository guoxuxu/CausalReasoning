  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod evolves according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where k is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of an intervention defined by a change in boundary conditions from \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0\\\\) (a constant temperature) to an impulse response \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0 + \\\\delta(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nCan we determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,0)\\\\) across the entire rod from the known temperature at \\\\(x=L\\\\) over time, assuming no intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of temperature at a single point like \\\\(x=L\\\\) without additional data points or boundary conditions does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,0)\\\\) across the entire rod.",
