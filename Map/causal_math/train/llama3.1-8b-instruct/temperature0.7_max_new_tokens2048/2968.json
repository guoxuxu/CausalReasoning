  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time t according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final output at t = T, is it feasible to uniquely determine which transformations (either \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( T' \\\\), or none, or both) were applied throughout the evolution, based only on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping influences and possible equivalence in outcomes stemming from different combinations of transformations and differential evolution, it is inherently challenging to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied. Identifying the interventions uniquely is impracticable without additional information on their application and the corresponding matrices C and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
