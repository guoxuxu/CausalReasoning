  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), given that no other information about the time evolution or the initial conditions is known?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be uniquely extracted as the imaginary part of the pole of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). This characteristic holds independently of initial conditions or specific system evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
