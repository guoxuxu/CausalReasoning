  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the role of the integral transformation \\\\(T(u) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} u(t) \\, dt\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u(t)\\\\).\n\nIf a modification via additional integral transformation is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), using \\\\(V(u) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\, dt\\\\) (where \\\\(\\alpha\\\\) is a constant), will the final Laplace transform, \\\\(T(u)\\\\), only reflect the properties of the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not the additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The earlier application of the transformation \\\\(V(u)\\\\) would alter the trajectory of \\\\(u(t)\\\\), affecting how it evolves under \\\\(L\\\\) subsequently. As a result, both \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(\\alpha\\\\), by affecting the intermediated state of the system, influence the final output observed in \\\\(T(u)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
