  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of the transformation specified by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by M and not by D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional layer of complexity. The systems's final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the interplay between all matrices M, D, and E. The transformations modeled by each exponential function could compound or negate each others' effects depending on their properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
