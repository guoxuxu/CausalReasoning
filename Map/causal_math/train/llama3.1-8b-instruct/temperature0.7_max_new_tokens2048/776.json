  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), in which z is a complex variable, A is a real number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. The transformation applies to study the effect of rotations in the complex plane under different time transformations.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine if any change in the rotational rate (from A to B) occurred or identify the specific intervention timings without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information, multiple scenarios (different Bs, or timing of applying B) could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The inherent ambiguity in the effects of compounds of exponential rotations (due to their periodic nature and dependency on the interval lengths) prevents unequivocal backtracking of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
