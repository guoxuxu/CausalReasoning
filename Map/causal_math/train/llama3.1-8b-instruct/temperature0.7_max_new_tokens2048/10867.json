  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sC} f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant coefficient, on this complex function over time t.\n\nIf, at time t1, another transformation \\\\( S(g)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sD}g(s) ds \\\\) (where D is a different constant) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 be influenced only by the coefficients A and B and not by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( S(g) \\\\) introduces an additional complexity to the system's evolution. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), therefore, will depend on all coefficients A, B, C, and D. These transformations, being integral and involving exponential terms, affect both the magnitude and direction of the function's trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
