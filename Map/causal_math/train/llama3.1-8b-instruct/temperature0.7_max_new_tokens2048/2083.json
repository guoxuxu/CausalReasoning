  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nIf a differential operation represented by \\\\( D[f](t) = f'(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T/2, will the resulting function at t = T be solely dependent on the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not influenced by the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operation as an intervention modifies the transformation output by differentiating the accumulated function. This derived function is dependent on both the behavior of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the effects of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), hence influenced by both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
