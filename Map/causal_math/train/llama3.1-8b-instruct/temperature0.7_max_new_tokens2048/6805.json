  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant representing angular frequency and K a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial state of the function by integrating over it, which changes the trajectory of the evolution depending on the parameters \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( K \\\\), making the state at time T different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
