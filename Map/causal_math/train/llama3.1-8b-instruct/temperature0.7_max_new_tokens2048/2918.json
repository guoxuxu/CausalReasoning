  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of an oscillating term. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is also a constant.\n\nConsidering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) observed at t = T, can the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately inferred if it is unknown whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was involved, it is impossible to determine with certainty the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The (non-linear) influence of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) on the system’s evolution obscures backwards calculation of initial conditions without this critical information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
