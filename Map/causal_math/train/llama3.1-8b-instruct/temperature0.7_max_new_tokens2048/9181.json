  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\), where A is a 2x2 constant matrix. Observe the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\), where P is a constant invertible 2x2 matrix, and its effects on the solutions.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) and the system evolves as per \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t = T be identical to the evolution starting from the vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the same system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(x)\\\\) changes the initial state from \\\\(x_0\\\\) to \\\\(Px_0\\\\). The evolution process dictated by \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\) will then follow a trajectory from this new initial condition, leading to different results at time T unless P commutes with the exponential of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
