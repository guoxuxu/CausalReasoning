  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + K\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(K\\\\) a constant. We analyze the effect of employing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on \\\\(u\\\\), defined by \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), examining how it evolves in the transformed domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve in the transformed domain according to the transformed differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) correspond directly to applying the Fourier transform to the evolved state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) under the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the linearity of the Fourier transform and the way differential operators transform, the evolution in the Fourier domain follows the transformed equation, leading to a state that is equivalent to the Fourier transform of the evolved state using the original differential equation. The correspondence holds under the assumption that no nonlinear transformations are involved.",
