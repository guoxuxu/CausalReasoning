  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) that maps real numbers x, y into the complex plane. The function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\), where A and B are fixed complex numbers. We are interested in examining the effects of applying a Laplace transform to x and a Fourier transform to y, and how these transformations influence the calculation of an integral over a defined region.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to x and the Fourier transform to y, then calculate the integral of the resulting function over a region R, will this integral be the same as if we had directly calculated the integral of \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\) over R without these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations modify the functions in ways that fundamentally alter their behavior. The Laplace and Fourier transforms change the domain and the nature of the function, resulting in a different integral value over the region.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform of x → transformed x; Fourier transform of y → transformed y; transformed x, transformed y → integral over R; Laplace transform of x, Fourier transform of y, f(x, y) → integral over R"
