  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\Delta u\\\\) governs the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) over a domain, with constant thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\). We investigate the impact of a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), and analyze its influence on temperature evolution.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\) a transformation \\\\(v(x,t) = u(x,t) + h(x,t)\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is an additional heat source term, will the system at \\\\(t = T > t_1\\\\) depend only on initial \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) and not on the transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The additional heat source term \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) modifies the temperature distribution differently from the standard heat equation, which means that the state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will depend significantly on \\\\(h\\\\) as well as on the initial conditions and the original system dynamics. Thus, it will reflect the impacts of both the Fourier transform and the heat source term.",
