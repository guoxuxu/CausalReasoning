  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in the context of an operator \\( L \\) defined on a complex function space whereby \\( Lf = \\lambda f \\). We analyze the effects of altering this relation by an integral transform \\( T \\) defined by \\( (Tf)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x,t)f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a given kernel function.\n\nGiven a function \\( g \\) in the transformed space, can you infer that there existed an eigenfunction \\( f \\) such that \\( Tf = g \\) without knowing the specific properties of \\( T \\) and \\( L \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the kernel function \\( k(x,t) \\) of \\( T \\) and the operator \\( L \\), it is indeterminate whether \\( g \\) could be directly associated with an eigenfunction \\( f \\) through the transformation \\( T \\). The transformation could significantly alter properties and relationships originally held by \\( f \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
