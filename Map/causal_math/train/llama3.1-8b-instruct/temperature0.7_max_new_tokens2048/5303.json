  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new intervention via function \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(k\\\\) and not on \\\\(A\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention implies adding another exponential term \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which introduces additional dynamics into the system. Therefore, the final state of the system at \\\\( T \\\\) will be a function of kinetic constant \\\\( k \\\\), as well as the matrix constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), due to their respective influences through the initial and intervention transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
