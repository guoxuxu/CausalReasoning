  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}\\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a function of real variable t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) from the modified system where z(t) has possibly changed due to an unknown intervention, can the exact nature of the intervention (specifically, the value of C if applied) be uniquely determined from only \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about whether an intervention took place and what the original value of A was, the transformed value observed in \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) could arise from different combinations of A and C (since \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\frac{1}{s-(A+C)} \\\\)). Thus, the values A and C cannot be uniquely retrieved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
