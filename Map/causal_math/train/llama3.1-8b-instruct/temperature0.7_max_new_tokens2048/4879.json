  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention \\( g(z) = e^{i\\phi}z \\) (where \\( \\phi \\) is a constant) is applied, will the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\theta \\) or \\( \\phi \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) introduce additional phase shifts \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) respectively, affecting the final state. The system's behavior becomes a composition of initial and interventional transformations, making \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( \\theta \\), \\( \\phi \\), as well as \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
