  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to determine if the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was simply due to the natural behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) or altered due to the initial scaling and rotation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents tracing back to the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
