  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is increased, and the system evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the position in the complex plane at any given time t be the same as with the original frequency?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affects the rate at which the function rotates around the origin in the complex plane. A higher frequency results in a quicker rotation, hence the position in the complex plane at any fixed time t is different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
