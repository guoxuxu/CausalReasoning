  "Problem": "In a complex system, let's consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This transform changes the domain from time to frequency for easier manipulation. The function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents a system response and is affected by system properties. An intervention is considered by altering the function through multiplication with another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system response function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is given by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( U(s) \\\\), then transformed to \\\\( U_p(s) = U(s) \\cdot P(s) \\\\) due to some property change, will the original time-domain behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without any transformation be retrievable from \\\\( U_p(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( U(s) \\\\) to \\\\( U_p(s) = U(s) \\cdot P(s) \\\\) alters the function significantly. The multiplication by \\\\( P(s) \\\\) may introduce poles and zeros, which can change the original function's behavior in the time domain, thus making it impossible to retrieve the unaltered \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from \\\\( U_p(s) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( P(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
