  "Problem": "Consider a reaction-diffusion system expressed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u + k(u)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator and \\\\(k(u)\\\\) is a nonlinear function of u. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) over the spatial variable x.\n\nIf an intervention via another transformation, say a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on \\\\(u(x,t_1)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), changes the condition at that time, will the system's state at \\\\(T\\\\) where \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) still be predictable solely from the original PDE without accounting for the effects of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) during the process introduces a change in the modal energy distribution, influencing how diffusive and nonlinear dynamics play out subsequently. The final state at time T becomes a function of both transformations, the original PDE dynamics, and how they interplay.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
