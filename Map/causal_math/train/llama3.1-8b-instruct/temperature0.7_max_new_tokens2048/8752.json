  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical RLC circuit with a voltage source described by a sinusoidal function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the amplitude, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The response of the circuit is analytically described by the Laplace transform of the voltage across different circuit elements.\n\nCan the precise value of the additional resistance introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be deduced purely from the change observed in the Laplace transform of the steady-state circuit output, assuming the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Though changes in output can imply modifications in circuit properties, precisely determining the value of the newly added resistance from the Laplace transform of the steady-state output would generally require more specific data around initial conditions and exact circuit layout, which are not stipulated here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
