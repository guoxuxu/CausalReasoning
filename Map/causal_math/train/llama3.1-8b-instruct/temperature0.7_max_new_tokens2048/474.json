  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario involving a sequence of functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and its transformations. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and a convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) are used. Analyze the impact of the convolution \\\\(y(t) = x(t) * h(t)\\\\) on the transformed signal over frequency domain \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) of some output, can we always determine the specific contributions of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) without prior knowledge of either?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific contributions of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) from \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) alone is generally not possible without additional constraints or knowledge, as there can be many pairs of functions whose Fourier transforms multiply to give the same result due to the non-uniqueness of the decomposition in frequency domain.",
