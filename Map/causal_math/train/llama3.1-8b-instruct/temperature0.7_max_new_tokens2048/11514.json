  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are fixed matrices. Analyze how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) as another constant matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when applied at different stages.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the transformation induced by \\\\( M \\\\) could have adjusted the trajectory in ways that are not reversibly traceable, particularly given \\\\( M \\\\) does not necessarily commute with \\\\( P \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
