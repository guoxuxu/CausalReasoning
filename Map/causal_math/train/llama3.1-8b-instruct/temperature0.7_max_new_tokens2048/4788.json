  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix, and relate its transformations to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\}(s) \\\\) and its inverse. We assess scenarios when intervening by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) for another constant matrix \\\\( B \\\\).\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we decisively trace back whether the interventions (either \\\\( u(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely by knowing \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the inherent properties of matrix exponential functions and their overlapping effects, multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) could result in the same end state at \\\\( u(T) \\\\). This ambiguity makes it impossible to definitively infer which interventions were applied based solely on the final outcome studied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(z) → u(T); u(z) → A; B → g(z); g(z) → u(T); u(T) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → inverse Laplace transform; inverse Laplace transform → u(z); A → B; u(T) → intervention"
