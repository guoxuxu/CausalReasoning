  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) was applied, it is not possible to accurately trace back to the original form of \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) because the transformation via \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have significantly altered the input, affecting the resultant function \\\\( y(T) \\\\) in a way that does not uniquely correspond to any specific \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
