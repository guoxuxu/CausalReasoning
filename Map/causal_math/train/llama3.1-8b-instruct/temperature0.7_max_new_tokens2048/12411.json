  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a linear integral transformation defined by \\\\(I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA} f(s) ds\\\\) where A is a constant matrix and f is a vector-valued function. We assess the effect of a function perturbation on the transformed system where \\\\(f(s)\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(g(s) = e^{Bs} f(s)\\\\), with B being another constant matrix.\n\nAssuming the output \\\\(I[f](T)\\\\) is known, is it possible to conclusively determine whether the original function was subjected to transformation \\\\(g(s)\\\\) or the intervention \\\\(h(s)\\\\) or both?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities introduced by the different exponential manipulations (\\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Cs}\\\\)), multiple combinations of inputs and transformations could potentially lead to the same endpoint \\\\(I[f](T)\\\\). Thus, identically resulting outputs do not allow for conclusive backtracking to the specific transformations applied without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
