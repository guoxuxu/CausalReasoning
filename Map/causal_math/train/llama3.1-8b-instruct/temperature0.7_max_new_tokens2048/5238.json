  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original vectors x and y without knowing the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing A and B, the contributions of x and y to the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely separated as different A and B could differently scale and rotate x and y, leading to the same observed endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
