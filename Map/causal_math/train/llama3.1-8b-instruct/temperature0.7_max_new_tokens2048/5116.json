  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex domain \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. We investigate the effect of the complex integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\), or both) were applied, solely by knowing the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of the exponential multipliers \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) in the transformations, it is infeasible to distinctly identify the transformations applied from the end result alone, as multiple combinations of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) may yield similar outcomes in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
