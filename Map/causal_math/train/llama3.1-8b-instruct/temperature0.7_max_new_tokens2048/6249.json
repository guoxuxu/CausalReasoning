  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The domain boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\) has been split into two parts, where on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_1\\\\) the function \\\\(u\\\\) is held fixed at zero, and on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\), a non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is applied involving the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial n} = h(x)\\\\). We examine the effect of modifying the Neumann boundary condition by a function \\\\(g(x,t)\\\\) which depends on position and time.\n\nIf \\\\(h(x)\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(h(x) = kx\\\\) for a constant k without any further changes, will the solution \\\\(u(x)\\\\) in the domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) be the same as with the original \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(h(x)\\\\) to \\\\(kx\\\\) alters the Neumann boundary condition, which directly affects the normal derivative of \\\\(u\\\\) along \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega_2\\\\). This change modifies the distribution of the flux across the boundary, leading to a different solution within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
