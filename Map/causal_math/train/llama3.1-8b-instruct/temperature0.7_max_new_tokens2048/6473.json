  "Problem": "Consider a context where z is a complex function of a real variable x, written as z(x) = u(x) + iv(x) where u and v are real-valued functions of x. We study the effects and causes considering the integral transformation T defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf we apply transformation T to z(x) without any additional changes or interventions, will T(z)(x) necessarily encapsulate all properties and behaviors of the original function z(x)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform T(z), being computed over an infinite domain and involving exponential decay, generally captures only some aspects of z and primarily its behavior at small values of x due to the e^{-xt} factor. Key features or oscillations at higher values of x might be significantly attenuated or entirely lost in the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
