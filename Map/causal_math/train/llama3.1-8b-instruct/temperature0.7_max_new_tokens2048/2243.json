  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial vector of complex numbers. We explore how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, influence the system's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention by another transformation, say a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{Ct}z\\} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex matrix, is applied at a certain 'time' s after the initial Laplace transform and system evolution, will the state at a later time T depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) without considering the effects of \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform as an intervention introduces an additional layer of complexity and alters the trajectory in the frequency domain. The final state at time T is dependent on both matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), as well as the interactions between these transformations (Laplace and Fourier). The interplay between these transformations affects the system's evolution and ultimately the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
