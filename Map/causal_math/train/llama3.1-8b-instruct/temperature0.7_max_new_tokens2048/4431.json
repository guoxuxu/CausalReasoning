  "Problem": "Assess the role of the Laplace transform in a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\), where D is a diffusion constant. Analyze the outcomes when the function \\( h(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha} \\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as a Laplace transform modifier at initial and various times.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a second Laplace transform modifier \\( i(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\beta} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the result \\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) be immune to alterations from \\( h(s) \\) if only the effect of \\( D \\\\nabla^2 u \\) is considered?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the second modifier \\( i(s) \\) introduces additional complexity and dependence on the parameters \\( \\\\alpha \\) and \\( \\\\beta \\), affecting the diffused profile at time T. The previous application of \\( h(s) \\) contributes to how the system reacts up to \\( t_1 \\), and post \\( t_1 \\), both modifiers influence the dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
