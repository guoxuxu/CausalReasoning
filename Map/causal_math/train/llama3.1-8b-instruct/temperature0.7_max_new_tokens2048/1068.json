  "Problem": "We explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z dt \\\\), where D is also a complex constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( I(z) \\\\), \\\\( J(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from different potential interventions or a combination thereof. Since the integral transformations involve complex exponentials whose effects may overlap or disguise one another, it is not feasible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
