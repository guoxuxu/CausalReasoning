  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under the rules \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) till time t = T without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) exactly match the state obtained if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial conditions of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), introducing a complex exponential factor controlled by \\\\( C \\\\). This factor, depending on how C interacts with A and B, changes the evolution path from what would have been obtained under the native dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
