  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + \\\\sin(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M(t-s)}z(s)ds \\\\) is used to investigate causal relationships.\n\nCan we deduce the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing its transformed form \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing the exact transformation used?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and how it integrates with the dynamics \\\\( Mz + \\\\sin(t) \\\\), retrieving the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible. The transformation presumptively alters the traceable history of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through its integral manipulation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
