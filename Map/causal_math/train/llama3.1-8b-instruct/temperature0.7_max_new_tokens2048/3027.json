  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, directly influencing subsequent behavior, would the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without accounting for the effects of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after the application of \\\\( T \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) would not only depend on the natural evolution but significantly on the accumulated effect resulting from the transformation \\\\( T \\\\). The intervention modifies the trajectory by integrating past states, which means it cannot solely depend on the continuous, thereafter unwanted evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
