  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the impact of the Laplace Transform and its inverse on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Therefore, knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) enables the precise recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) via the inverse Laplace Transform, assuming proper conditions are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
