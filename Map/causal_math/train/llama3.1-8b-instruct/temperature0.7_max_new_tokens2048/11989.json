  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nCan we precisely reconstruct the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its frequency domain representation given by the Fourier transform, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform allows for the exact reconstruction of the time domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its frequency domain representation. Given the precise and invertible nature of the Fourier transform for functions like \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\), this process accurately restores the original signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
