  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nIf we observe \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial point \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), it is not possible to accurately trace back to the exact initial point \\\\(z_0\\\\) because the transformation could have significantly altered the initial conditions, and the general solution of \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\) depends sensitively on those conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
