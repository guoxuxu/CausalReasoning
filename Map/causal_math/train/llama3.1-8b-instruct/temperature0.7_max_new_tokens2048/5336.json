  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after applying a filtering process \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and undergoing natural system evolution, by only analyzing the solution at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the filter alters specific frequency components, which changes the solution dynamics. Without precise knowledge of the filter characteristics and the initial form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\), reconstructing the exact initial state at t = 0 from observations at t = T becomes ambiguous due to potential alterations in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
