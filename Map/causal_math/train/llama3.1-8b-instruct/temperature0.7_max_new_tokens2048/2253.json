  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex vector and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a Laplace transform, defined symbolically as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this system over the complex frequency variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) at t = 0 and then observed for changes in its spectral character over \\\\( s \\\\), will the Laplace transform result only depend on the matrix \\\\( C \\\\) and vector \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) purely depends on the matrix \\\\( C \\\\) and the vector \\\\( x \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{Ct}x \\\\) applied in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) directly relates to how the matrix \\\\( C \\\\) and the vector \\\\( x \\\\) control the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, and thus completely determines the spectrum over \\\\( s \\\\) without external influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
