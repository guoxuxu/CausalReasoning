  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), \\\\( q(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The contribution of both control functions \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) to the final state could be overlapping or indistinguishable in the effect they produce by the time t = T. Therefore, without additional data or constraints, it's unclear whether both, one, or neither was used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
