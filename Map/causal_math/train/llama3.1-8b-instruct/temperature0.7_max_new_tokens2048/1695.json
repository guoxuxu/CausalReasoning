  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, representing circular motion with unit radius and angular velocity of 1 radian per unit time. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), particularly focusing on the Laplace transform for different values of the complex variable s.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a frequency shift is applied as an intervention by multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), altering its angular velocity, will the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) still only depend on the original formulation and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(t + \\\\omega t)} \\\\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The new Laplace transform will differ due to the change in frequency, indicating dependence on both the original function and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
