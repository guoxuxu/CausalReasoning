  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore how the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) and its modification by a function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affect the system.\n\nAssuming the intervention \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be solely dependent on the original heat equation parameters and independent of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) acts as a damping factor, influencing the heat distribution and thus the Fourier transform results. The intervention changes the system’s state post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), making \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) dependent not only on the heat equation but also significantly on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
