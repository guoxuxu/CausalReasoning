  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition. We look into the effects of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse affect the function over time t.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has undergone the interventions of Laplace transformation and \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), can we determine precisely if both, one, or none of these transformations were applied based only on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the final observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is challenging without additional information. Both the Laplace transform, its inverse, and the square transformation could contribute to the final state, and discerning their individual impacts requires more than the endpoint data due to the potential overlap in effects these transformations can create.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
