  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the observed \\( z(T) \\) can be reached either by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) naturally or by squaring an initially transformed state, it's impossible to deduce if \\( z_0 \\) was \\( e^{i0} \\) or \\( (e^{i0})^2 \\) without additional information about whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
