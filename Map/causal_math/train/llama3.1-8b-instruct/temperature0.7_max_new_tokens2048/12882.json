  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} dt \\\\), where z is a complex number with a positive real part. We explore the impact of two transformations defined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) on the complex plane as \\\\( A(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular point the function \\\\( g(z) = z - 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is evaluated, will the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) only depend on the original function and not on the previous transformations by \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = z - 1 \\\\) further modifies the argument for \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and does not nullify previous transformations. The transformations by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) may have altered the complex plane in such a way that the resulting integral, even after applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\), depends on all applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
