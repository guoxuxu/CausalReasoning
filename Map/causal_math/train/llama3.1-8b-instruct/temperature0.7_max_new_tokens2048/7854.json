  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine how an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, affects the system.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\( u(0) \\\\) and \\\\( v(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the integral transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, and given the non-inverse nature of the integrated effect combined with exponential components, we cannot uniquely determine the initial conditions from the transformed state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
