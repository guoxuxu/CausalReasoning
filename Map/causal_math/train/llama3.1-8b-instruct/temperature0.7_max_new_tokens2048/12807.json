  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is used to modulate an input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The output signal is given by \\\\(y(t) = z(t) \\\\cdot x(t)\\\\). The goal is to study the changes in the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) as compared to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we precisely deduce both the original signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the exact times and values of frequency changes in \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by knowing the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(T)\\\\) at a given point T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-unique nature of the transformation involving phase and frequency modulation, the exact original signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and details about interventions like changes in \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) cannot be conclusively deduced purely from observing the Fourier Transform at a single point. Multiple plausible scenarios could result in the same observed data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
