  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), after applying a damping intervention, can we precisely identify whether only the damping factor was applied or if there were also changes to \\\\( a, b, c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) after intervention includes the effects of both the potential changes to \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) and the application of the damping factor. These transformations' combined effects make it challenging to isolate and identify the specific types of changes or interventions applied solely based on the Fourier Transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
