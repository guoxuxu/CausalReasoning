  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(\\\\alpha + i\\\\beta)u} z(u) du \\\\) with constants \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) is allowed to evolve naturally under its given differential equation, will the transformed function \\\\( T(z) \\\\) for a fixed time T be the same if no transformations are applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform modifies the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating it with an exponential factor \\\\( e^{(\\\\alpha + i\\\\beta)u} \\\\). This effectively changes how the function accumulates phase and magnitude over time, resulting in a transformed function that is not simply \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T but an accumulation of the function's history multiplied by an exponential weight.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
