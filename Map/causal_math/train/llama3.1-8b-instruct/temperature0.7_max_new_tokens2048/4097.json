  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) forming an RL circuit, subjected to a voltage \\( V(t) \\) described as a sinusoidal input \\( V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The response of the circuit is analyzed by examining the current \\( I(t) \\), and we analyze the effect of a transformation \\( f(I) = e^{st}I \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\( f(I) \\) is applied to the circuit at \\( t = 0 \\), transforming the initial current and then the system is allowed to respond to the input voltage without further intervention, will the current \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( I(t) \\) was allowed to respond from initial conditions without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(I) \\) modifies the initial condition of the current, influencing the phase and amplitude of the system's response due to the properties of the exponential transformation under the damped sinusoidal response of the RL circuit. The result is an alteration of the current's behavior over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
