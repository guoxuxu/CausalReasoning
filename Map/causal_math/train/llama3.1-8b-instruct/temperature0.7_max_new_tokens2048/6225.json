  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is transformed through a Laplace Transform to produce \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The system is defined by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the circuit's response is calculated using the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot V(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes changing the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) from a unit step to a sinusoid directly affect the output voltage \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) when processed through \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( V(s) \\\\), and since the output \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot V(s) \\\\), a change in \\\\( V(t) \\\\) inevitably affects \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
