  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven only the final observed signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), can we precisely ascertain the transformations used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could potentially result from different combinations or sequences of transformations due to the independent and overlapping effects of transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Various parameter choices for \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) might lead to similar or identical effects, complicating the determination of exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
