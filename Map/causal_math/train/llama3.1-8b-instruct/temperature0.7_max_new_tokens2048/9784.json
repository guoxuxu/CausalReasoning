  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (\\\\( f(X) \\\\), \\\\( g(X) \\\\), or both), purely based on the knowledge of \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of applied transformations due to the overlapping effects of exponential growth/decay factors introduced by \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), alongside the inherent randomness introduced by the Wiener process. This makes it impossible to precisely decipher the sequence or presence of specific transformations from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
