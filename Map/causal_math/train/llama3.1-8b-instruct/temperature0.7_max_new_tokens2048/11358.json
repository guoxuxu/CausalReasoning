  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) assuming no information about the intervening time evolution is known?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( g \\\\) and the mapping \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are both non-linear and the latter involves time-dependent rotation, it’s generally impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the value of T or \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
