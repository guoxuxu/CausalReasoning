  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied where s is a complex number.\n\nIf a controlling factor \\\\( u(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) (where k is a constant) modifies both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), does the output of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original differential equations and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) introducing the exponential factor modifies the system dynamics and hence influences both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Therefore, the final output of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) will also depend on the nature of the intervention k as well as the coefficients A, B, C, and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
