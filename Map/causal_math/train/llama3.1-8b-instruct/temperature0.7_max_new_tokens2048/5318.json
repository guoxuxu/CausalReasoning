  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) (squaring the function) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to deduce whether the frequency was originally \\\\( ω \\\\) or modified to \\\\( 2ω \\\\) due to the squaring. Multiple initial conditions (direct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or squared \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\)) could lead to the same observation, introducing ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
