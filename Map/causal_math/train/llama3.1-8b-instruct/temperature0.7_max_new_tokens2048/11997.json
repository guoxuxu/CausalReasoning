  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) can we deduce the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) being applied, the presence of the exponential term \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) affects the inversion process, making it ambiguous to recover the original \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely due to the non-trivial time-dependent factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
