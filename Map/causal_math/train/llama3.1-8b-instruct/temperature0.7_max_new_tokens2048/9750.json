  "Problem": "Analyze the response of a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) to the system state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and study the progression over time t.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,T)) \\\\) at time T, can we unambiguously determine the original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation that a Fourier transform was applied initially, directly interpreting \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,T)) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) could be misleading. The Fourier transform alters the domain of the function; thus, without knowing the initial manipulation, we might incorrectly reconstruct the state’s history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
