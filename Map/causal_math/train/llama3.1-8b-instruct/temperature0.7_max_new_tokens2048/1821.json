  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of a Fourier transform on this function as an intervention.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\) until time T, will the system's behavior be the same as if no initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was specified?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) sets the initial state from which the differential equation progresses. Any changes to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) impacts the solution trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus influencing the future states of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
