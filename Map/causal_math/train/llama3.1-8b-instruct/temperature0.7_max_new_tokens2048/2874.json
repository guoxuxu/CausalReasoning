  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) which describes the heat distribution in a rod over time. We also examine a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) which transforms the heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nCan we infer the initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and knowing it evolved under the heat equation, without applying a Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) requires solving a potentially ill-posed inverse problem. The diffusion of heat can blur initial details, leading to many possible reasonable guesses for \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). Applying a Fourier transformation can provide more direct insight by examining frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
