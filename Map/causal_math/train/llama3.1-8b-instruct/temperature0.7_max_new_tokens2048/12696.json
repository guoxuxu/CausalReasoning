  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with a function transformation defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x t^kf(t) dt \\\\) where k is a constant and f is a differentiable function. The impact of the linear operation transformation \\\\( L[z(x)] = \\int_0^x z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, x].\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is defined and the system \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is shaped accordingly at t = 0, followed by the operation \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) over time [0, x] without further intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) be solely dependent on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is a direct integral transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) dependent on x, and subsequently \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) encapsulates the cumulative impact of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over [0, x], the outcome of \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) is entirely determined by the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Any alterations in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) will distinctly alter the results of both \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
