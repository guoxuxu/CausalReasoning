  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nIf during the evolution at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is applied via a filtering function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), affecting the system as \\\\( u(x,t_1) = h(x) * u(x,t_1) \\\\), will the eventual state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) during the system's evolution modifies the state at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), in turn affecting all subsequent states. The Fourier transform of the convolution, \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(k) \\\\hat{u}(k,t_1) \\\\), indicates that the changed \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t_1) \\\\) influences the final transformed state, making it dependent on the form of \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
