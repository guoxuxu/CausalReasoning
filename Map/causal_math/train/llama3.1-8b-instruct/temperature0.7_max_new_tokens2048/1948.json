  "Problem": "Assume a linear algebra context where we define the operation \\\\( L(v) = Sv \\\\) and \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\), with S and T being constant matrices. The system evolves according to the vector field defined by \\\\( L \\\\) initially, and we explore various modifications and impacts using the transformation \\\\( M \\\\).\n\nCan the interventions applied (whether an initial, intermediary, or none involving \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\)) be uniquely determined from the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\), by knowing just the end condition and the matrix \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise nature and timing of interventions like \\\\( M \\\\) solely from the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) is generally infeasible without additional constraints or information. The evolving nature under non-commutative matrices introduces ambiguities, as different initial settings and intervention timings can yield the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
