  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{R}}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is the capacitance, \\\\(R\\\\) is the resistance, and \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. We investigate the response of the circuit to transformations defined by the Laplace transform of the input voltage signal \\\\(V(s) = L[v(t)]\\\\) where \\\\(v(t) = e^{At}v_0\\\\) being an exponential input signal.\n\nCan we deduce the exact original input voltage \\\\(v_0\\\\) at t = 0 from observing the output \\\\(v_{out}(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the circuit composition \\\\(R, C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the circuit parameters \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), the exact nature of the input signal cannot be traced back from the output due to the complex interplay of resistance and capacitance influencing the signal transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
