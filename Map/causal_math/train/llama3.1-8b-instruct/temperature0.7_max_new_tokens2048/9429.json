  "Problem": "Consider the control system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), where K is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents the control input. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( y \\mapsto H(t) y \\\\), where \\\\(H(t) = e^{Mt}\\\\) and M is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(y\\\\) is initially transformed by \\\\(H(0) = I\\\\), the identity matrix, and evolved under the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\) without further intervention, would \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied and it was directly evolved under the same controls?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\(H(0) = I\\\\) does not change the initial condition, and there are no changes in control inputs or system dynamics thereafter, \\\\(y(t)\\\\) will follow the same path as if no transformation were applied, resulting in the same state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
