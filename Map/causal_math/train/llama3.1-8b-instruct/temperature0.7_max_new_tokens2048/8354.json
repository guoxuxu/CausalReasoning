  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nHaving observed the position \\( x(T) \\) at time T, can we accurately deduce the initial condition \\( x_0 \\) if we do not know whether transformation \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the certainty of whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied to the initial state, determining \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) becomes ambiguous. The nonlinear nature of \\( f(x) \\) may result in multiple potential values of \\( x_0 \\) that could yield the same \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
