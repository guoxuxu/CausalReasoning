  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled harmonic oscillators whose state is described by the vector function \\\\(\\\\vec{z}(t)\\\\). The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z})(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\vec{z}(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAssuming the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z}) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0, and the system evolves naturally post-transformation under \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\) without any external interventions, will \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(t) \\\\) for any t > 0 be identical to the case where \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(t) \\\\) is evolved directly from t = 0 without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the spectral components of the initial state, affecting how each frequency component evolves under the matrix M. This results in a different overall state evolution, implying \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(t) \\\\) would not be the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
