  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we conclusively determine what transformations were applied (either \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(R(z)\\\\), both, or in what sequence) based solely on knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of initial and intermediate transformations involving \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), potentially in different sequences. The non-commutative nature of matrix multiplication (especially in complex domains) introduces additional complexity, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack and define the specific sequence or types of applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
