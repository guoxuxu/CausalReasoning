  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), and given the effect of C on the initial condition, it becomes impossible to accurately trace back to \\( z_0 \\) solely based on the observed state at t = T, especially if A and C do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
