  "Problem": "Consider the control system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), where K is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents the control input. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( y \\mapsto H(t) y \\\\), where \\\\(H(t) = e^{Mt}\\\\) and M is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\(y_0\\\\) from the observed state \\\\(y(T)\\\\) after it has been evolved according to \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\) without knowing whether a transformation by \\\\(H(t)\\\\) was applied initially? ",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if a transformation \\\\(H(t)\\\\) was applied initially, it's challenging to revert \\\\(y(T)\\\\) to \\\\(y_0\\\\). Especially if \\\\(H(t)\\\\) significantly alters the initial state at some t, or if M and K do not commute, making it hard to isolate the effects of the initial controls and system dynamics from the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
