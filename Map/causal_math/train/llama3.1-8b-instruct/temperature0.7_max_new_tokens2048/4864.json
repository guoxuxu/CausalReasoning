  "Problem": "In a complex system, let's consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This transform changes the domain from time to frequency for easier manipulation. The function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents a system response and is affected by system properties. An intervention is considered by altering the function through multiplication with another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original transformation (\\\\( P(s) \\\\) or \\\\( Q(s) \\\\)) be uniquely identified from the final observed response \\\\( U_p(s) \\\\), just from knowing the modified response in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( U_p(s) \\\\) which is a result of composite transformations by \\\\( P(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(s) \\\\), it is typically impossible to uniquely decipher which function or combination of functions was applied. The overlap in effects caused by different potential transformations makes it challenging to backtrack to the specific interventions accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
