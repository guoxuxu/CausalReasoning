  "Problem": "In a complex analysis setting, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and t represents time. The impact of the integral transformation defined by a convolution integral \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) over time t, with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another function, is analyzed.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time T, can we decisively infer which convolution kernel (either \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), or both) was applied at earlier times based only on the observed output?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) can lead to similar or identical outputs at time T. Without additional constraints or information, the effect \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at T cannot solely reveal which specific convolutions were applied, due to their potentially overlapping influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
