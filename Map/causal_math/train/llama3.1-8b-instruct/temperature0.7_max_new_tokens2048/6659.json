  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) acting on this function.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a scaling transformation by a complex number \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is implemented as an intervention, will the resulting transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) exclusively reflect the dynamics described by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the scaling transformation alters the magnitude and potentially the phase of the state vector, thus modifying the system's trajectory and affecting the values in the Laplace transform. The result is not solely dependent on A and B but is also influenced by the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
