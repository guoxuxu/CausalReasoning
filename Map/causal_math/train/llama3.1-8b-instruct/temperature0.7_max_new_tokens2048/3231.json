  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) over the domain [0,1], where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined by the integral transformation \\\\( Lf(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\) and \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function representing a complex interaction.\n\nIf a modulation function \\\\( M(x) = e^{cx} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant) is applied pre-integration to \\\\( x^2 \\\\), and then transformed by \\\\( L \\\\), will the final output be dependent only on \\\\( L \\\\) but not the modulation \\\\( M(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the modulation function \\\\( M(x) = e^{cx} \\\\) before transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) incorporates the modulation into the transformation process. Because of this pre-application, the output after applying \\\\( L \\\\) is influenced not only by the operation of \\\\( L \\\\) but also significantly by the characteristics of \\\\( M(x) \\\\), therefore depending on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
