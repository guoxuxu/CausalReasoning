  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore the behavior of this function under the Laplace transform and its inverse, especially when analyzing causality both ways between input and output functions.\n\nIf an intervention modifies function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(x) = e^{(A+B)x} \\\\) part-way through observation, then takes the Laplace transform, can the effect of \\\\( A \\\\) alone still be isolated?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introducing matrix \\\\( B \\\\) alters the system, adding a new dimension to the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\). The resulting Laplace transform now encodes the combined effect of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), and isolating the influence of \\\\( A \\\\) alone from the resultant transform is not feasible without additional information on \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
