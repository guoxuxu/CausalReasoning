  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) mapping from the complex numbers to complex numbers. Let's evaluate transformations induced by this function in the context of signal processing, particularly using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\), and apply \\\\( f \\\\) to the Laplace transformed function.\n\nIf an intervention applies a new function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), directly to the Laplace transformed output of \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\) and then applies \\\\( f \\\\), will the final Laplace transform result, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f(h(\\\\mathcal{L}[t](s)))](s) \\\\), be identical to the original \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[t^2](s) = 2/s^3 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( h \\\\) modifies the system significantly. Applying \\\\( h \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[t](s) = 1/s^2 \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[1/t](s) \\\\), and transforming this via \\\\( f \\\\) follows a completely different mathematical pathway compared to the transformation sequence without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
