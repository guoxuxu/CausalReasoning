  "Problem": "Investigate a system under the effect of a linear transformation expressed through the matrix exponential. The system is defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, and the impact of transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) modifies the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), creating a new initial condition. Since the system's evolution is sensitive to initial conditions and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory based on the structures of D and M, the state at time T will be different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
