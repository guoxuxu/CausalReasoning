  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u(x, t), resulting in \\\\(U(k, t)\\\\).\n\nGiven only the final observed state u(x, T), is it possible to delineate precisely what interventions took place (application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\), or no intervention), based solely on the observed final state and operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios involving different interventions or no intervention could lead to similar or identical final states, particularly when transformations like Fourier and inverse Fourier are involved that can theoretically reverse each other's effects under certain conditions. Therefore, multiple histories could yield the same endpoint, obscuring the specific path taken.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
