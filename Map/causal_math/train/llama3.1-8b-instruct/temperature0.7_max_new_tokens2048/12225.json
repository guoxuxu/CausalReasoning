  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact original initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) after observing the system state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at any time t, without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform, we cannot uniquely determine whether to apply the inverse transform on \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Thus, two different initial conditions, one being the Fourier transform of the other, could lead to irreversibly different states under \\\\( L \\\\), making exact reconstruction impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
