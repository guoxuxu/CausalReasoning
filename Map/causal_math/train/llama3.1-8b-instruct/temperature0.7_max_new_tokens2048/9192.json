  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system's states. The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is used for analysis.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) observed at s = s_0, can we definitively determine if an intervention, specifically the application of a matrix \\\\( B \\\\), was used?",
  "Explanation": "The output in the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) could result from different interventions or even from inherent system dynamics without interventions. Without additional information about the system states or a more detailed history, the presence and nature of interventions like \\\\( B \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
