  "Problem": "Imagine we are studying a linear system of differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant coefficient matrix. To examine the behavior under different transformations, we introduce the function \\\\( g(x) = x^T Qx \\\\), a quadratic form where Q is a symmetric constant matrix.\n\nIf we introduce a new transformation \\\\( h(x) = P x \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which linearly alters the system state, will the state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only rely on M and not on Q or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( h(x) = P x \\\\) injects a new dynamic, altering the linear pathway of the system depending on matrix P. The new trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will thus be influenced by how P interacts with M and potentially Q if any quadratic operations remain effective. As such, the final state at T will depend on matrices P, Q, and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
