  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex due to the possible overlapping effects of the exponential factors \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\). These transformations can yield equivalent end states from different initial conditions and sequences of application, obscuring the identification of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
