  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = z(0) \\\\) initially and then evolved under the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further application of \\\\( h \\\\), does the resulting path follow the same trajectory as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) squared for all t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the trajectory from a unit circle to a path described by \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\). This represents a circle in the complex plane but at twice the angular velocity, hence diverging from the simple square of the original path over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
