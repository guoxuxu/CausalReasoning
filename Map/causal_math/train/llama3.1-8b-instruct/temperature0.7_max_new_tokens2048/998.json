  "Problem": "Consider the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in a flat, thin rod over time \\\\(t\\\\), governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the rod material. We investigate the impact of a change in boundary conditions defined by the step-function \\\\(\\\\phi(x) = T \\\\) (constant temperature) applied at one end of the rod.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) along the rod at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we infer if the boundary condition \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(x = 0\\\\) from \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the temperature distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\) depends on the boundary conditions, simply knowing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) without additional context does not uniquely indicate whether the specific boundary condition \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) was applied, as other initial conditions or environmental factors could yield similar distributions.",
