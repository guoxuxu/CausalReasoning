  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) periodically, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify what transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity introduced by the nonlinear term and possible transformations at different times, multiple combinations of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and the initial conditions can lead to the same observed state at \\\\( T \\\\). This non-uniqueness prevents definite identification of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
