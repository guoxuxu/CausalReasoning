  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. These equations describe the dynamics of two separate systems. We explore the effect of applying the integral transform \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)C} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on these systems.\n\nIf \\\\( T[f] \\\\) is applied separately to the solutions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from t = 0, will the resultant function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after transformation be the representation of \\\\( x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the original differential systems without any T applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) changes the evolution of each component, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), by integrating past values in a manner weighted by the matrix exponential term \\\\( e^{-(t-\\\\tau)C} \\\\). This affects each trajectory differently based on how C interacts with A and B, thus altering the resultant complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
