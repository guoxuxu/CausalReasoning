  "Problem": "Analyze the outcome of a linear integral transformation \\\\(G(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(t, x) f(t) dt\\\\) on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(K(t, x)\\\\) is a kernel function. We examine the scenarios when the kernel function changes over time, defined as \\\\(K(t, x, s)\\\\) where s represents a parameter influencing the kernel.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\(G(x) = \\\\frac{x^(s+1)}{s+1}\\\\) from an unmodified integral transformation, can we infer the exact form of the kernel \\\\(K(t, x)\\\\) without knowing the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\(f(t)\\\\), it's impossible to precisely identify \\\\(K(t, x)\\\\) from \\\\(G(x)\\\\) alone. The transformation outcome can be generated by a variety of kernel-product function combinations, indicating multiple potential causal origins for the same effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
