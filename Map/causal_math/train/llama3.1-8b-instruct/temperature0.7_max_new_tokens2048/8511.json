  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying another Laplace transformable function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at some time, modifying our system to \\\\( y''(t) = (y' * g)(t) \\\\), will the new transform \\\\( Y''(s) \\\\) depend only on the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), irrespective of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform \\\\( Y''(s) \\\\) is a product of all involved transforms, specifically \\\\( Y''(s) = Y(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\), where \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Therefore, it depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), along with the original \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
