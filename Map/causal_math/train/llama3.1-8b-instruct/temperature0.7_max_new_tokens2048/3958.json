  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nCan one infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the computation to revert \\\\( z(T) \\\\) back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) neglects the exponential scaling inflicted by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), potentially leading to a misinterpretation of the initial state due to the lack of information about the scaling factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
