  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own rule without any further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if it was directly evolved to t = T without applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) alters the initial state by integrating with itself over time, thus the complex exponential is modified initially, resulting in a trajectory that differs from the simple exponential propagation \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) over the same period.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
