  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a function's domain and range are controlled by differential equations \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\) and \\\\(dy/dt = Qy\\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. We investigate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T[x(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Rs}x(s) ds\\\\) on x(t), where R is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine the original function \\\\(x_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(T[x(t)]\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\(T[x(t)]\\\\), it's impossible to revert the effects of the integral and exponential operation uniquely. The transformation could significantly alter the initial state in a way that isn't retrievable from the final state alone, especially if R has nontrivial interactions with P.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
