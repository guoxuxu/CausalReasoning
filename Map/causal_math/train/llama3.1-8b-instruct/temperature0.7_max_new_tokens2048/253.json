  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transformation of a real-valued function \\(\\psi(t)\\) defined as \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). We explore the impact of a linear differential operator \\(L = d/dt + a\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant, applied to \\(\\psi(t)\\).\n\nIf \\(L\\) is applied to \\(\\psi(t)\\) producing \\(L\\psi(t)\\), and then \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega)\\) is calculated, will the result be the same as directly applying the Fourier transform to \\(L\\psi(t)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the Fourier transform ensures that transforming after applying the operator \\(L\\) gives the same result as transforming \\(L\\psi(t)\\) directly. This follows from the properties of linear differential operators and their interaction with integral transforms.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the linear differential operator L to ψ(t) yields Lψ(t), which is then Fourier transformed to get \\hat{ψ}(ω)."
