  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We evaluate its behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 = 0 \\\\) purely by observing the transformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the cubing transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to distinguish if the observed dynamics arose from a naturally evolving \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) or a modified initial condition \\\\( e^{3iwt_0} \\\\). The process is not reversible without additional information on transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
