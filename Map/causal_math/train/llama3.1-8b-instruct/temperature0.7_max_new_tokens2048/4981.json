  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the linear transformation \\\\( T: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) and let \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. A transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is known to be applied, where B is also a constant matrix. The behavior of the system under this transformation over time t is studied.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be precisely the vector obtained by directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "After applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), the initial condition at t = 0 becomes \\\\( e^{B0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\). The progression over time then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}e^{B0}z_0 = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), which coincides with the evolution without applying \\\\( g \\\\). However, if B affects the system dynamics differently from A, the trajectory post this initial alteration could diverge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
