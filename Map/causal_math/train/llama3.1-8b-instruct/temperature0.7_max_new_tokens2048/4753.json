  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the heat distribution over a rod with length L is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where u is the temperature function, k is the thermal diffusion coefficient, and subscript denotes partial derivatives. The Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}\\)) is used to analyze conditions and interventions on the temperature profile.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution is transformed by a Fourier transform at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve according to the original heat equation, will the temperature distribution at time T be equivalent to if the Fourier transform had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform to the initial condition changes its representation to the frequency domain, essentially altering the initial conditions of the heat equation. Since the equation evolves based on these initial conditions, the temperature distribution at time T will have evolved from this new base state, resulting in a different temperature profile than if the Fourier transform had not been applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
