  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving through a vector field described by the velocity function \\\\( v(x, t) = Ax + h(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and h(t) is a time-dependent vector function. We explore the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{As}x ds \\\\) on the particle's trajectory.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying another transformation \\\\( S_t(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-As}x ds \\\\), will the particle's position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from t_1 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S_t(x) \\\\) introduces a transformation with the invert of the exponential factor e^{-A}, but the system's trajectory still depends on h(t) from t_1 to T due to the ongoing influence of the vector field, affecting the final position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
