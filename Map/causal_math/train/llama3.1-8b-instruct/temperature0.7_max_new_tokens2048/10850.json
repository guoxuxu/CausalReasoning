  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) is a constant. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) versus simply evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf we observe the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t, can we determine the initial configuration \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial application of the Fourier transform, backtracking to the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is hindered by the lack of information about the domain (frequency vs spatial) in which the function was evolved, particularly because the Fourier transform affects the representation of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
