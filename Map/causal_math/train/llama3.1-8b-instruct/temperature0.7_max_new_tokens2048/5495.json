  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential V(x), described by \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = [-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 + V(x)]\\\\psi \\\\). We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) at time t and analyzing its momentum space representation.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, and then the system continues to evolve, will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original Schrödinger dynamics and not on the Fourier transform applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) alters the state in momentum space, which when converted back to position space and evolved, retains effects of the transformations and thus depends on both the properties of the Fourier transform and Schrödinger dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
