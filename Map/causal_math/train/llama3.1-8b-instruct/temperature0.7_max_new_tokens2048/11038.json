  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) from an evolved system with the PDE, can we determine whether a Fourier transform was applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without knowing the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the original condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\), the observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) provides no additional information on whether a Fourier transform was applied initially. The linear nature of the system and the transform means any initial state, transformed or not, results in an end state that fits the natural evolution under the PDE.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
