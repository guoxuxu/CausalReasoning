  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of signals transformed by the Laplace Transform S defined as \\\\( S[f(t)] = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). Consider the impact on a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} + ax = b \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants. Examine scenarios where the signal is either altered by a modulation or operation defined as \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\) and then further transformations.\n\nIf the operation \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\) is applied to the signal function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and then allowed to evolve as per the Laplace Transform without further intervention, will the Laplace domain representation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be the same as the direct Laplace Transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\) modifies the original function structurally resulting in the Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) = -F'(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) is the derivative with respect to s. Hence, \\\\( G(s) \\\\) will not equal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) due to the t-multiplication altering the exponential decay rate by adding a derivative factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
