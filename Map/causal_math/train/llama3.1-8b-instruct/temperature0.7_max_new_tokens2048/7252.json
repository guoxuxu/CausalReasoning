  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and C is a real constant. The function undergoes an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we unequivocally determine which transformations or interventions were applied (either \\\\( T[z] \\\\), \\\\( S[z] \\\\), or both) based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences of transformations and interventions could lead to the same or indistinguishably similar states at \\\\( T \\\\). Without additional information about the process (such as exact times and nature of interventions), it's impossible to precisely trace back the specific transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
