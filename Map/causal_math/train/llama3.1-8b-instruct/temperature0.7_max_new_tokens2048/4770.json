  "Problem": "Consider a stochastically driven system modeled by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + BX_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are deterministic matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Brownian motion. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(X) = C e^{Dt}X_t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and explore the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic component added by \\\\( B \\\\) and the unknown application of \\\\( g(X) \\\\) introducing \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) makes it uncertain to retroactively determine \\\\( X_0 \\\\). Multiple initial conditions can evolve into the same state at time T due to the random nature of Brownian paths and unknown transformation applications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
