  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a Holomorphic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane. The integral transformation is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\\\beta t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s reflect changes only due to the new transformation and not from the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\\\beta t}z(t) \\\\) results in a new integral \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}e^{-\\\\beta t}z(t) dt = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-(s+\\\\beta)t}z(t) dt \\\\), which is a modification that involves both the effects of the intervention and the character of the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), reflecting compounded transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
