  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation by the contour integral along a path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in the complex plane. The integral transformation is described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi - z} d\\\\xi \\\\), which depends on the path of integration \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\).\n\nIf the path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) used in the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) encircles the origin, will this affect the nature of the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) when applied to a point not on or inside \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is affected by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) due to the residue theorem. If \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) encircles the origin, the integral introduces a term owing to the singularity at the origin, impacting \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at points outside but near \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) differently, particularly affecting values via the principal value of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
