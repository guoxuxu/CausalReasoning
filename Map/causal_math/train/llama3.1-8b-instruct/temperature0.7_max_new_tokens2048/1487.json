  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform operation on a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how it interacts with a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\( u \\\\) is an external input. The causal inference is about the effect of changes in \\\\( u \\\\) through a time-dependent control function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), which is applied before taking the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new intervention function \\\\( k(t) = e^{Ft} \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied to \\\\( u \\\\), modifies the input from that point forward, will the Laplace Transform of the system output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( k(t) \\\\) again alters the input \\\\( u \\\\), adding another layer of complexity to the system. Both E and F, through their respective exponential terms, significantly influence the system's overall behavior and its representation in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
