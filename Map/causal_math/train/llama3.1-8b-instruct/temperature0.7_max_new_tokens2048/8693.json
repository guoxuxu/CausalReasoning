  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit (Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C)) in series. The governing differential equation is \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = 0\\\\), describing the charge \\\\(q\\\\) on the capacitor over time. We are interested in the effects of applying a Laplace transform to this equation, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is applied to the differential equation at the start and then let the system evolve under this transformed equation without further intervention, does the solution \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain give the same outcome for \\\\(q(t)\\\\) when transformed back to the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are linear operators that uniquely transform the differential equation and its solution between the time and frequency domains without altering the inherent system behavior. The transformation back to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transform will yield the original function \\\\(q(t)\\\\), assuming all conditions are appropriately handled.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
