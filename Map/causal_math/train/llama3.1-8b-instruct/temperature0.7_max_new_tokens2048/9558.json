  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system modeled by \\( Ax = b \\) for a vector \\( x \\) and matrix \\( A \\), involving transformations by a function \\( f(x) = Mx \\) where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We assess causal impacts in the presence of this transformation.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) after observing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\( f(x) \\) was applied, reconstructing \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) becomes uncertain, as \\( x(T) \\) could be either \\( x_0 \\) or \\( Mx_0 \\), depending on the application of \\( f(x) \\). Without knowledge of \\( M \\), the initial vector cannot be precisely deduced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
