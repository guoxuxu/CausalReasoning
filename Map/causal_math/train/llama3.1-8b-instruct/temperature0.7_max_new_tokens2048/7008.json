  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number and \\( t \\) is time. This function represents a point moving in a circle on the complex plane. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\), on this function over the frequency domain \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) showing a shift from a delta function at \\( \\omega \\) to one at \\( \\omega + \\Delta \\), can we determine that the only intervention made was the change in \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although a direct shift in the delta function from \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega + \\Delta \\) strongly suggests an increase in the frequency \\( \\omega \\) by \\( \\Delta \\), it cannot conclusively prove that no other modifications (such as amplitude scaling or additional phase shifts) were applied unless additional information is provided. The delta function shift is indicative but not exhaustive of possible transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → z(t); z(t) → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → \\hat{z}(\\ω'); \\hat{z}(\\ω') → shift in frequency; Δ → shift in frequency"
