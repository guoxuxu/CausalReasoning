  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) where A is a constant matrix describing the system dynamics, B is the input matrix, and u is the control input. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to this system resulting in the transformed equation \\\\(sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BU(s)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we exclusively identify which exact intervention was applied on the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), only from the knowledge of the state at T?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention solely based on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the potential for multiple different interventions yielding the same endpoint, especially given the effects of A and various feasible modifications of B through different control inputs. Without additional information about the trajectory or intermediate states, the exact intervention remains indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
