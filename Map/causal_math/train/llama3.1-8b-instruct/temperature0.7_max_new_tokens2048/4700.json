  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations or interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation sequences might result in similar or even identical end states, especially given the complex interactions of integrals with exponential and periodic functions. Without additional information, it's impossible to uniquely distinguish between the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
