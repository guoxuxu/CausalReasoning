  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nUsing the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowing the system to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further action, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the path of evolution by integrating the state over time influenced by \\\\( B \\\\), thus altering subsequent evolutions from simply \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) due to the integral component, leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
