  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf a function modification \\\\( G(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex constant) is applied midway through the path \\\\( C \\\\), will the resulting integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) G(z) dz \\\\) solely depend on the original function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( G(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( G(z) \\\\) modifies the function under integration, making the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) G(z) dz \\\\) a composition influenced by both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). These combined effects can significantly alter the integral's outcome, reflecting the interaction between \\\\( Z \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
