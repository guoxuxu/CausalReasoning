  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is described as \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of input variables, and \\\\( H \\\\) is a transformation matrix. The evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. We analyze how the impulse response defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) affects the system over time.\n\nKnowing the output at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine the interventions used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), by just analyzing the output value?",
  "Explanation": "Deduction of specific interventions based solely on the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping influences and potential non-commutative interactions between \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\). The manipulations provided by these matrices could lead to multiple possible input trajectories that yield the same output, thus obscuring the exact nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
