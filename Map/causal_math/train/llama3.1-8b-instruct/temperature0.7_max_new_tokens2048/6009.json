  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions modified by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) on the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) to solve for the internal values of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the boundary conditions are changed using \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) and the system is then solved using the Laplace equation without further interventions, will the use of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) provide an accurate solution for \\\\( z \\\\) inside domain \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the Laplace equation by transforming spatial derivatives into algebraic terms. Even with modified boundary conditions by \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\), as long as the Fourier transform is correctly applied taking into account these conditions, it can accurately solve for \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
