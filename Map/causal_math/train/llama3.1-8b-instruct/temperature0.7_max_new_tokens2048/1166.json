  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the complex initial condition. We evaluate how the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant, affects the evolution over time.\n\nBased on the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "It's impossible to retroactively determine the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), because the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could substantially modify the system's path, and multiple initial conditions could lead to the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
