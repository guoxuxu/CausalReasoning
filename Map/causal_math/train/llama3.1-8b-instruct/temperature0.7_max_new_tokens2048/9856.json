  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) represents a signal in the complex plane, evolving over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), applied at time t = 0.\n\nGiven the observed changes in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) over time, can we determine exactly when the switch from P to Q happened?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact switch time from P to Q based solely on changes in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) is challenging because the transform could obscure subtle differences due to integrating over all future values of z(t). The precise moment of change might not be distinctly marked in the transformed signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
