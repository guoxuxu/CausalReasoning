  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence of transformations applied (\\( h(z) \\\\) and/or \\( j(z) \\)) just by knowing the state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the multiplicative nature of exponential and polynomial transformations in complex functions, different sequences and choices of transformations can lead to the same final state. For instance, the effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) followed by \\\\( j(z) \\\\) might not be distinguishable from a different sequence or even a single transformation due to overlapping effects in the exponential domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
