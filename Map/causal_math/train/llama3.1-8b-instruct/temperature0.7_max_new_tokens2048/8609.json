  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis scenario where we study the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the effects of performing an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane is described at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and is evolved through the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) without any intervention, will the function value at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be simply \\\\( e^{z_0} e^{T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional transformation or intervention, the evolution of the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is straightforward exponential growth. Hence \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for \\\\( z = z_0 + T \\\\) results in \\\\( e^{z_0 + T} = e^{z_0} e^{T} \\\\), following the properties of the exponential function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
