  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) without any further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) initially transforms the state by a complex exponential factor, which affects the system’s trajectory. The transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) introduces a rotation in the complex plane, altering the evolution of the state which is further compounded by the system dynamics under M, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
