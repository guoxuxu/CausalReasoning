  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( Y''(s) \\\\) at the end, can we identify uniquely which transformations (\\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both) were applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "The product form of \\\\( Y''(s) = Y(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\) doesn't allow us to distinguish between the effects of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) purely based on the final transform, due to the non-identifiability of the contributing factors from the product alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
