  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function impacts a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), with D being a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a certain point t, can we conclusively determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the input \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( \\omega \\\\) solely from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information about initial conditions or the matrix D. The system response \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be influenced by various combinations of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and initial states, making it non-trivial to isolate \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the observed effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
