  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We analyze the system’s behavior when exposed to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\), where D and N are constant matrices and D is diagonalizable.\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after evolving according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), is it possible to infer uniquely whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions uniquely depending on D and N, which might not uniquely determine the starting state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just based on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without exact knowledge of the transformation parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
