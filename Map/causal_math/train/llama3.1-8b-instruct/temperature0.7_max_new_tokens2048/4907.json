  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} F(t) dt \\\\, C \\\\) where C is the contour in the complex plane and F(t) is an analytic function. We are investigating the implications of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\( L[G] \\\\) on \\\\( G(z) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional complex function \\\\( H(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention during the transformation so the new transformation becomes \\\\( L[H \\cdot G] \\\\), will the resulting function solely depend on the transformation properties of \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( H \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(t) \\\\) influences the resultant function, reflecting combined properties of both \\\\( H(t) \\\\) and \\\\( L[G] \\\\). The interaction between \\\\( H(t) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the outcome substantially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
