  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis scenario where we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We apply a Laplace transform to both x and y: \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) = Y(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven Z(s) at some point, can we infer the initial states x(0) and y(0) precisely if we don't know whether there was an initial perturbation?",
  "Explanation": "Since Z(s) combines influences of both X(s) and Y(s), multiple combinations of x(t) and y(t) could result in the same transformed output Z(s). Without knowing specific perturbations or the exact transformation conditions, exact retrieval of initial states x(0) and y(0) from Z(s) remains indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
