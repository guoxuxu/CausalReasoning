  "Problem": "A complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined where \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied, and the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied under this transformation over time.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations due to their compound effects. Starting with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) means the trajectory initially follows \\\\( z(t) = e^{2it} \\\\) until \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes it to \\\\( e^{6it} \\\\) (since tripling the doubled angle results in six times the original angle). Therefore, the trajectory, and hence the final state at T, depends on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
