  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) and transformations are applied as \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, deducing the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous as \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduces a multiplicative factor \\\\( e^{kT} \\\\) that cannot be unfolded or identified solely from observing the state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
