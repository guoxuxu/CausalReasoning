  "Problem": "Assume a linear system of equations represented in matrix form \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is an invertible matrix. Analyze scenarios applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), with \\\\( x_0 \\\\) being the initial conditions, over the time domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the state at t = T, can we recover the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the precise dynamics (i.e., matrix A) beforehand?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x_0 \\\\) purely from the Laplace transform of the state at a specific time T requires knowledge of matrix A, as the inverse Laplace transform needed to retrieve \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is dependent on correctly formulating \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) which in turn relies on A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → time domain; Laplace transform → state at t = T; state at t = T → initial conditions x0; matrix A → Laplace transform; matrix A → state at t = T; initial conditions x0 → Laplace transform; initial conditions x0 → state at t = e^{At}x0"
