  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to initialize \\\\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T follow the same trajectory as if \\\\( z \\\\) was evolved directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the initial condition transformed by \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is essentially a scaled version of its original state with the influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) offset by the transformation, the resulting dynamics effectively trace the same path, merely adjusted proportionally by the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
