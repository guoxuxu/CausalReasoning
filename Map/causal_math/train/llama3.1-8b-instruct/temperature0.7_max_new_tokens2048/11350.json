  "Problem": "Let's analyze the behavior of a particle moving in a complex potential field described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = p(t) + iq(t)\\\\) where \\\\(p(t)\\\\) and \\\\(q(t)\\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates in a plane and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z + F(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\(F(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent force function.\n\nGiven the particle's motion trajectory \\\\(z(t)\\\\) for a duration \\\\([0, T]\\\\), can we uniquely determine the force function \\\\(F(t)\\\\) applied during that interval assuming no intervention other than the differential equation's natural progression?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the complex exponential factor \\\\(-i\\\\omega z\\\\) which affects both amplitude and rotation compounds with any potential effects from \\\\(F(t)\\\\), rendering it impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer \\\\(F(t)\\\\) solely from the trajectory without additional data on initial conditions and other potential forces.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
