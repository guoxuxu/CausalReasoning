  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) involves the parameter \\\\( k \\\\) explicitly (as the decay rate in the exponential based on \\\\( k \\\\xi^2 \\\\)). Without knowing \\\\( k \\\\), we cannot accurately invert the Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) because the magnitude of decay across different frequencies remains unknown.",
