  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) =  x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a signal's components in time. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an additional filtering process \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain before performing an inverse Fourier transform, will the resulting function perfectly represent the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the filter \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the original characteristics of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), hence the time-domain function obtained post-inverse transform will reflect these changes, failing to be a perfect reconstruction of the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
