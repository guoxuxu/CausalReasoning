  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping described by \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\) in the complex plane, and assess the impact of an integral transformation on this function given as \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int e^{-st} w(t) \\\\, dt \\), where s is a complex number.\n\nKnowing the final output at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we accurately determine which, if any, integral transformations were applied during the evolution, based solely on this endpoint measurement?",
  "Explanation": "The final output at time \\\\(T\\\\) may result from various combinations of initial function forms and transformations. The lack of one-to-one mapping between the output and specific transformations due to potential overlap in effects precludes exact inference of the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
