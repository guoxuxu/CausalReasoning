  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical study of electrical circuits where the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through a component is influenced by the Laplace transform applied to a time-dependent voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\). The system's differential equation is given by \\\\( I'(t) = L{V(t)} + RI(t) \\\\), with R being the resistance.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original form of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after examining \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for some T > 0, without knowledge about the application of the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform could significantly change the characteristics of \\\\( V(t) \\\\), determining the original form of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( I(T) \\\\) can be misleading without knowing whether the transform was originally applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
