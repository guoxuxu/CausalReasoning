  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We evaluate the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0) = u_0(x)\\\\).\n\nCan the original spatial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) be uniquely determined from the evolved state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T without knowledge of whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of a Fourier transform and subsequent evolution introduce transformations that are not straightforwardly reversible without explicit knowledge of these operations. Without this knowledge, reconstructing the exact initial state \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) is ambiguous, especially since phase information can be altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
