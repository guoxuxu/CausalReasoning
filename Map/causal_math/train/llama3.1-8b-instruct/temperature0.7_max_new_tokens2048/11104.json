  "Problem": "Investigate a system characterized by the continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of a signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), denoted as \\\\(X(f)\\\\). Explore how the multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\(f_0\\\\) is a frequency offset, affects the transform.\n\nKnowing that the final spectrum is \\\\(X(f-(f_0+f_1))\\\\), is it feasible to determine accurately whether the signal was first modulated by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\), then by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_1 t}\\\\), or just once by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i (f_0+f_1) t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency shift property of the Fourier transform does not encode the sequence or individuality of modulations when they are commutative in effect. It is impossible to ascertain from the final spectrum alone whether there were one or multiple steps of modulation, as the net effect of frequency shifting is indistinguishable in these cases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "signal x(t) → CTFT X(f); CTFT X(f) → multiplication by e^(2πi f0 t) → modulation in time domain; modulation in time domain → X(f-(f0+f1)); signal x(t) → modulation by e^(2πi (f0+f1) t) → X(f-(f0+f1))"
