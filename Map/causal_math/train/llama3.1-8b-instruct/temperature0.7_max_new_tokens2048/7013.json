  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit represented by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the frequency complex variable, and circuit behavior is regulated by this impedance function. The circuit undergoes a Fourier transformation which impacts the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an initial impulse signal \\\\( I(t) = \\delta(t) \\\\) (Dirac delta function) is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the circuit is allowed to evolve under its natural impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), without further intervention, will the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be solely dependent on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) to the initial impulse is determined by the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by the system's inherent properties defined by \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Thereby, \\\\( R(t) \\\\) is solely a result of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and the properties of the Fourier transform applied to the impulse signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
