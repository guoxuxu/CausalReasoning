  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing oscillations influenced by a damping constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). The function is transformed using the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the functions to \\\\( x'(t) = ax(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y'(t) = ay(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a scalar amplification, does this alteration change the subsequent form of the Laplace transform \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) as compared to the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",

  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
