  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A+B)s}z(s) ds \\\\) on z over the time interval [0, T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{t1}^T e^{C(s-t1)}z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, ignoring the effects of C?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) further adds complexity to the evolution of z, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on matrices A, B, and C. The effects of C introduced during the interval [t1, T] should also be considered, adding an additional layer of transformation that influences the terminal behavior of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
