  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately back-calculate and confirm that both the initial squaring and a later conjugation occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exact interventions (squaring and a specific-point conjugation) from the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is problematic without additional information. Multiple initial conditions and interventions can lead to the same final state in the complex plane, especially considering the symmetry and periodicity of complex exponentiation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
