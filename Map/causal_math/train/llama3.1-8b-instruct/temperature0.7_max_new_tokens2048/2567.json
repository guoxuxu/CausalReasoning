  "Problem": "Consider a complex function $z(t)$ defined by the integral transformation $z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{At} x(s) ds$, where $A$ is a constant complex matrix, and $x(t)$ is a vector function. We analyze the impact of an additional operation $f(z) = e^{Bt}z$ at time $t$, where $B$ is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time $t_1$, a new operation $g(z) = e^{Ct}z$ (where C is a constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state $z(T)$ for T > $t_1$ depend only on $A$ and not on $B$ or $C$?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with $g(z)$ introduces additional complexity, contributing further distortion based on $C$. The resulting behavior of $z(T)$ will depend on all three matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$, each influencing the computation through the combined and overlapping effects of their respective matrix exponentials on the integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
