  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions, expressed as \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a potential function. An external spatial transformation is defined by \\\\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) is applied to the coordinate system at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\(u(h(x,y))\\\\) still satisfy the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\\\) can alter the nature of differential relationships in the Laplace equation. It potentially induces non-linearities or changes in the harmonic properties of \\\\(u\\\\), which generally results in \\\\(u(h(x, y))\\\\) not satisfying the Laplace equation unless specific conditions on \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
