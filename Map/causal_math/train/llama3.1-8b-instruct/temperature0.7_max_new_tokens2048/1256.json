  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial function Z(t) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (\\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( w(t) \\\\), or both) just by knowing \\\\( Z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) at time T could potentially be achieved through various combinations of intervening complex functions due to non-uniqueness in phase and amplitude effects caused by different frequencies (\\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\eta \\\\)). This ambiguity prevents unique identification of the specific transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
