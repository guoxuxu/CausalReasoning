  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) over time t, where S is a complex constant. We are analyzing how this transformation interacts with the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied to reach \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex due to potential overlaps in the effects of different exponential transformations. The non-commutative nature of multiplying exponential terms of complex matrices and potential cancellations or reinforcements between S and Q's effects make it difficult to pinpoint the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
