  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex constant matrix. We also consider the effect of an integral transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ks} z(s) ds \\\\) over a time interval [0,T], where K is another complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we confirm whether the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied during [0, T] based solely on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide direct information about whether the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, as \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved by simple evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) or other transformations not related to \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not carry information about the path or transformations applied to the system during [0, T].",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
