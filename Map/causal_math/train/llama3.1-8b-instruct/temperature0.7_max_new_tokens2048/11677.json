  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with conductivity k. An initial heating pattern v(x) is applied as an initial condition and after a time period, a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x,t)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is a heating function, is introduced.\n\nIf the rod starts with an initial heating pattern v(x) and evolves according to the heat equation for a time period T without any additional heat input, will the temperature distribution u(x,T) be determined solely by the initial condition v(x)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any external interference such as added heat from function h(x,t), the final temperature distribution u(x,T) will be determined solely by the initial conditions provided by v(x) and governed by the heat conduction equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
