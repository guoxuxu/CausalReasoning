  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across an element is described by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( V \\\\) as a constant voltage amplitude and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the angular frequency. The response of the circuit (current, \\\\( I(t) \\\\)) is given by a convolution involving the circuit's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the observed \\\\( I(t) \\\\) assuming no knowledge about the initial frequency or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Just by observing \\\\( I(t) \\\\) without knowing the original and potentially varied frequency components or the specific form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely deduce \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Multiple frequencies could result in similar current patterns if the impulse response accommodates them.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
