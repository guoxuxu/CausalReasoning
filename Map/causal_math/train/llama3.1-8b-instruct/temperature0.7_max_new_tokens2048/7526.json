  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the consequences of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over a time period [0,T].\n\nAfter observing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the exact initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether additional transformation was applied after t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T provides a spectral representation over the interval [0, T], but does not uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without specific knowledge of transformations that occurred after t=0, since different initial conditions can yield the same Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
