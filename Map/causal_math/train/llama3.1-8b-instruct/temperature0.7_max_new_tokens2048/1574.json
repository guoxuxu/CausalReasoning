  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the nature and effect of the transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) on the system might have altered the initial conditions in a manner that doesn't allow backtracking to the precise original state due to the complex exponential effects of \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
