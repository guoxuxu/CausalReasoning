  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) where S is a complex square matrix. The system evaluates the function's behavior under the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to the function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) at an initial time t = 0 and evolving it change the final output compared to directly applying the Laplace transform to the function after it evolves over time u to a specific time t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform captures the integral effect over time, meaning applying the Laplace transform at the start or after time evolution can lead to changes based on how matrix S affects e^{Su} over time, particularly involving complex exponential behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
