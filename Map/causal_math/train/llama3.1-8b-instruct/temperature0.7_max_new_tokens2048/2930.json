  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants determining the growth rate in two different components x and y, respectively, as functions of time t.\n\nBased on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we uniquely determine the initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible unless the values of A and B are distinctly different to avoid overlap in the growth contributions of \\\\( x_0e^{AT} \\\\) and \\\\( y_0e^{BT} \\\\). If A and B are not sufficiently different, the components from x and y can become indistinguishable at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
