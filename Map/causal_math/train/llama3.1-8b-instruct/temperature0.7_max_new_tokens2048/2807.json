  "Problem": "Consider the evolution of a complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) under transformation by integration against a kernel function \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\), where \\\\( z, s \\\\) are complex variables. The transformation is described by \\\\( w'(z) = \\\\int_D K(z, s) w(s) ds \\\\). Assume that \\\\( K \\\\) modifies how the function behaves in the domain differently based on its parameters.\n\nSuppose at a certain point, an additional kernel transformation \\\\( K_2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention. Will the subsequent state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) for any \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\) depend only on the original kernel \\\\( K \\\\), ignoring effects of the new kernel \\\\( K_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new kernel transformation \\\\( K_2 \\\\) acts as an intervention that modifies the development trajectory and state of \\\\( w \\\\) within the domain. The final state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) will be influenced by the effects of both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\), thus not solely dependent on the original kernel.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
