  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nKnowing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after sequential Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations and evolution according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), can we deterministically ascertain whether the Fourier or its inverse transformations were actually applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The series of transformations (Fourier and its inverse) could potentially reset the function to a state that is indistinguishable from having no transformations applied at all, especially when combined with the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). This fact, coupled with the reversible nature of these specific transformations, makes it impossible to ascertain definitively the use of the interventions.",
