  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. To study its behavior, we introduce an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) of the function.\n\nGiven the overall Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) without explicit timestamps, can the exact time and nature of the frequency change intervention (from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)) be determined?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform encapsulates the complete system behavior into a transformed domain, but specific details about the timing or the nature of interventions, such as the exact moment or magnitude of frequency change, are not explicitly recoverable without additional temporal details or system observations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
