  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Qi \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We analyze the behavior under a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed final spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T, is it possible to determine precisely what interventions occurred (original Fourier transform, application of \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both), just by examining \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T could result from numerous combinations of base transformations and interventions due to the possible alterations in amplitude, phase shifts, and non-linear effects. Without additional constraints or data, these interventions cannot be uniquely inferred from the final spectrum alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
