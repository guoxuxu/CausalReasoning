  "Problem": "Consider the system x'' + p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0, where p(t) and q(t) are time-dependent coefficients. We're examining the effect of a Laplace transform on the mentioned differential equation, particularly focusing on the transformation sX(s) - x(0) - x'(0), where X(s) is the Laplace transform of x(t).\n\nIf we perform a Laplace transform on the differential equation, will the transformed equation provide insights about the system's stability without additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform converts the time-domain differential equation into an algebraic equation in the s-domain. Analysis of this equation, specifically its poles, directly provides information about the system's stability without the need for further transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
