  "Problem": "Consider an integral operation on the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) within the contour integral along a closed curve \\\\( C \\\\. The transformation to be applied is \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) before executing the integral.\n\nIf we intervene by applying another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) in the middle of calculating the integral of the already transformed function \\\\( e^{iz} z^2 \\\\), will the result only be impacted by this new transformation and not the structure of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) will influence the final result of the integral, as these transformations interact with each other and the functional form of \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). The outcome will be a combined effect of all applied operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
