  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can one ascertain whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information about system behavior between t = 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied initially, the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to retroactively determine the initial condition, especially as the function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) could yield multiple potential initial states, depending on the matrix M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
