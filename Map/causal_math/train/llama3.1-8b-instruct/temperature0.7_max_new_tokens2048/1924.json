  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\) after an intervention, can we determine whether the change at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) was due solely to a frequency shift or other functional modifications were imposed on \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the function at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) could be due to a frequency shift or other alterations (like amplitude changes or phase shifts). The integral transformation's result alone is insufficient to differentiate between these scenarios, as different combinations can potentially yield equivalent outcomes, complicating unambiguous inference about the nature of intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
