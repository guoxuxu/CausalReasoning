  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) to the system and later reversing it, as well as the transformation by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where M is also a constant matrix.\n\nSuppose \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is subsequently evolved according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention. Will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was only evolved according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\( e^{Mt}x_0 \\\\) at t=0, which fundamentally alters the system's trajectory. As \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) influences the initial state, the solutions will diverge unless M and D are suitably related (specifically, if M commutes with D).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
