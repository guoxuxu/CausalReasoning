  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\(\\int_0^t K(t-u) x(u) du = y(t)\\), where \\(K(s)\\) is a complex kernel function and \\(x(t)\\) is the input function. We study the changes in the output \\( y(t) \\) under the transformations initiated by different input functions such as \\( g(x) = x + Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) for some constant matrix \\( A \\) and scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied to a function \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the integral equation without further intervention, will \\( y(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0(t) \\) was directly evolved to t = T under the integral equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) modifies the initial input \\( x_0(t) \\) by adding a decaying exponential term, affecting the integral equation's convolution with the kernel \\( K(s) \\). This change alters the resulting output \\( y(t) \\) at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
