  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the integral transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( e^{-2t} \\\\) and influences the system through the convolution \\\\( y(t) = (f * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution product \\\\( y(t) = (f * x)(t) \\\\) integrates multiple values of \\\\( x(\\\\tau) \\\\) over a range of \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\), making it non-trivial to retrieve \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without additional constraints or data on the nature of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
