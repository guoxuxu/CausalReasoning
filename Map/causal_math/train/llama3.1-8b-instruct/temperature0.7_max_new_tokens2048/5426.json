  "Problem": "Given the complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), assess the effect of a contour integration transformation where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) traces a path specified by functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nCan the specific path \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that was followed be accurately reconstructed from the integral result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) along that path, assuming no information about the initial and final points is known?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of complex functions and their integrals, multiple paths could yield the same integration result. Without additional information regarding the bounds or specific path characteristics like curvature, a unique \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be determined solely from integral results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
