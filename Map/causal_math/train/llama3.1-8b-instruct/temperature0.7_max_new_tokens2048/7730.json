  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a current source I(t) and an impedance Z(s) in the Laplace domain, described by the Laplace transform equation V(s) = I(s)Z(s). We investigate the behavior of voltage V(t) as an exact causal response to the current I(t) through various manipulations involving complex function transformations.\n\nGiven the voltage V(t) in an unchanged system, can we uniquely recover the original current I(t) knowing only the impedance Z(s)?",
  "Explanation": "Since Z(s) is known and the Laplace transform linearly relates I(s) to V(s), it is possible to solve uniquely for I(s) as \\\\( I(s) = \\\\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)} \\\\), allowing us to determine I(t) using the inverse Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
