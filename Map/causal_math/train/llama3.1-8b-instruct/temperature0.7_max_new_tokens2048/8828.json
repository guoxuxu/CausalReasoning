  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven that \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine exactly which transformations \\(f(z)\\) and/or \\\\(g(z)\\) were applied, based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to distinguish whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), either, or both were applied, due to the potential equivalence in their effects over one cycle in complex exponential rotation, and the general non-linearities introduced by complex exponentiation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
