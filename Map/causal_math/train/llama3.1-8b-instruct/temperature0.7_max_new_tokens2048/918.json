  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-x^2s} \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(s) = s^2 \\\\). We study the transformed function defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) accurately or reconstruct \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) completely based on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without additional information on the kernel or the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( f(s) \\\\) or the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) from \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alone is not feasible without additional information about either function. The integral transformation convolutes information in such a way that various pairs of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( g(x) \\\\), leading to an indeterminate causal inference from effect back to cause.",
