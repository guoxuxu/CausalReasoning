  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore how the system behaves under different conditions when applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(t) = t^2 x(t)\\\\) and assessing the impact of this change across various scenarios.\n\nIf \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and allowed to evolve naturally, then the Laplace transform is taken, will \\\\(X(s)\\\\) at \\\\(s = a + bi\\\\) be same as if the transformation was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(h(t) = t^2 x(t)\\\\) alters the function before the transform is taken, specifically adding a polynomial term that changes the domain characteristics in the Laplace transform, resulting in a different transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}\\\\) compared to the original \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
