  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine precisely what interventions (application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or others) were used by observing only the final state \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) results from an integral that captures a mixture of the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and any interventions. Due to the loss of detailed time-domain information in the integral and the potential overlapping effects of different interventions, it is impossible to back-calculate and ascertain the exact nature or presence of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
