  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix and T is a specific time period.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) post transformation by \\\\(f(z)\\\\), can the original states \\\\(x(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y(0)\\\\) be uniquely determined without knowledge of C?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of C and given only the impact of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely trace back to \\\\(x(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y(0)\\\\) since the integral involving C might alter the trajectory in a non-reversible way, especially when C does not commute with A or B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
