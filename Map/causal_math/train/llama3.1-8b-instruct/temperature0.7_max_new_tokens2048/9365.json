  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The function undergoes a Laplace transform and subsequent inverse Laplace transform, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nDoes the application of the Laplace transform followed by its inverse to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and then evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\) without further intervention, result in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to be lossless transformations, meaning that when applied in sequence, they revert the function back to its original form. Additionally, \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\) aligns with the original function definition, maintaining the original behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace transform → Obtaining Z(s); Applying inverse Laplace transform → z(t); Applying differential equation → z(t) = e^(At); z(t) = e^(At) → z(t) = e^(At)"
