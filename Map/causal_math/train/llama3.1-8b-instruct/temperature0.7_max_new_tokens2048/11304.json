  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. This scenario examines the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\), with \\\\( P \\\\) being another constant complex matrix, on the system's evolution over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the precise transformations used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) be determined strictly from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and matrix interactions could potentially lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without detailed knowledge of the specific transformations applied throughout the timeline, the exact sequence and types of interventions cannot be unequivocally traced back from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
