  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), with \\\\( Q \\\\) being another constant matrix, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) significantly affects the trajectory. Without knowing the use of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), multiple initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or transformations could lead to the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
