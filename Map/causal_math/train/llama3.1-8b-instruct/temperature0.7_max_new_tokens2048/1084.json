  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nObserving the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after the scaling intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\. can we determine whether the intervention was purely scaling or if other transformations (like additional rotations) were also applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\), it is challenging to discern whether the transformation involved purely scaling by \\\\( s \\\\) or additional rotational transformations unless specific details about the nature or magnitude of these transformations are known. The complex interaction between scaling and rotation could result in equivalent endpoints from different sequences of operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
