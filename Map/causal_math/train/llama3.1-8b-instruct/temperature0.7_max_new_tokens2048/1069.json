  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position components in a temporal dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with A and B being complex numbers.\n\nIf the system is initially at a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\) without any intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T solely depend on the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's evolution is influenced not only by the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) but also by the constant term B and the coefficient A. The term B acts as a driving force adding a complex adjustment at each instant, modifying the trajectory over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
