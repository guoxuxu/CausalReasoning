  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( t \\) represents time. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\( F(z) \\) which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency components \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nIf \\( F^{-1}(z) \\) (the inverse Fourier transform) is applied at a specific frequency point \\( \\omega_1 \\) as an intervention, will the nature of the original \\( z_0(t) \\) solely determine the modified signal's characteristics at time \\( T \\), regardless of the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\( F^{-1}(z) \\) at \\( \\omega_1 \\) modifies the signal in a specific manner that depends not only on the original \\( z_0(t) \\) but on how the inverse transformation affects the components at \\( \\omega_1 \\). The outcome at time \\( T \\) is influenced by the characteristics of both \\( z_0(t) \\) and the nature of the inverse transformation applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
