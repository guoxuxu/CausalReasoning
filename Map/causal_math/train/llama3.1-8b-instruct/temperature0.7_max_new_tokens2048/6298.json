  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics of a particle moving in a potential field given by \\( V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. The motion is subject to an external force \\( F(t) \\), and the differential equation governing the motion is \\( m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx} + F(t) \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nGiven the position \\( x(T) \\) at time \\( T \\), can we determine the specific form of \\( F(t) \\) applied without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple forms of \\( F(t) \\) can result in the same position \\( x(T) \\) at time \\( T \\), especially without precise knowledge of initial conditions and the damping or other system characteristics like \\( k \\). Hence, \\( x(T) \\) alone does not uniquely determine \\( F(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
