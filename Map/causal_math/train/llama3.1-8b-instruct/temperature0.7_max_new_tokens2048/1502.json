  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate how the integral transformation \\\\( F[z(t)] = \\int_0^T e^{-Ct}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with C as another constant matrix, impacts this system over time T.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the result of \\\\( F[z(t)] \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied throughout the integration?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( e^{-Ct} \\\\) during the integration process, it's not possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F[z(t)] \\). The absence or presence of \\\\( C \\\\) radically changes the characteristics of the trajectory data integrated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
