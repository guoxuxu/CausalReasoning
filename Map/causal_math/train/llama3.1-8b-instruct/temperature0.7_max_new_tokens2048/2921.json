  "Problem": "Assume we are analyzing a thermal system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = \\\\Delta u + c u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature distribution in a medium, \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\(c\\\\) is a heat source term. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at t = 0, then the equation is evolved without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T be identical to if the untransformed \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was evolved to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the representation of the problem to the frequency domain and modifies how the differential equation behaves under this new representation. Even though the inverse transformation can reconstruct the temperature distribution in the spatial domain, the profiles are not identical due to the transformation affecting the propagation of frequency components differently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
