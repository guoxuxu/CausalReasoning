  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\) in the Fourier domain, can one infer whether the Fourier filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\), if we know there was possibly an intervention but not its specific nature?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential similarities in spectral characteristics induced by different possible interventions in the Fourier domain, it is impossible to definitively conclude the nature (type or absence) of the intervention strictly from observing the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\). Multiple causal paths might yield the same or similar final transformed states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
