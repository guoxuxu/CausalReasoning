  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is an initial vector. We study the implications of applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at some point in time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( i(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, purely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlap in the transformational effects and the properties of matrix exponentials, different combinations or orders of applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( i(z) \\\\) could yield the same final state. Identifying the specifics of the interventions used cannot be resolved uniquely by the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
