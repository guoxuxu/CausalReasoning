  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) is a function of space and time. An integral transformation particularly the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\) is considered to observe the behavior of the system in the frequency domain over time.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering operation characterized by a function \\\\( G(k) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t_1) \\\\), will the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be dependent solely on the operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the initial or the intermediate filter applied?",
  "Explanation": "The filtering operation acts as a transformation in the frequency domain, potentially altering the coefficients of modes comprising \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t_1) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) is influenced by both the initial conditions, the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), and the intervention represented by filter \\\\( G(k) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
