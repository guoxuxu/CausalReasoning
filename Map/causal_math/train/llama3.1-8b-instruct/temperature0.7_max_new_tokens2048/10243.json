  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We examine the response of the system under a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), which acts on \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift) is applied at time t_1, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T > t_1 still only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional phase shift modifies the complex function by a constant phase, influencing the Fourier transform output. This change results in a shift in the phase of the spectrum, thereby making \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the added \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
