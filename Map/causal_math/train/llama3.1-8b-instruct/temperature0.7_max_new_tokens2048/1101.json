  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolved directly from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially changes the nature of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from a point value to an integral value, affecting all subsequent evolution. Since the transformation integrates over time, initial conditions and system dynamics are fundamentally altered, leading to a different state at any time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
