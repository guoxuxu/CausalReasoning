  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} h(x) dx \\\\), known as the Laplace transform. We analyze the behavior of the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\\\) under this transformation, where r is a constant, and how modifications to the function and parameters affect inferences regarding cause and effect.\n\nCan we determine precisely whether the function was originally \\\\( e^{rx} \\\\) or changed to \\\\( \\\\beta e^{5x} \\\\) at some \\\\( x_1 \\\\), by looking solely at the final form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing the final transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) does not necessarily reveal whether and how the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was altered at some point, due to potential overlaps in the characteristics of the Laplace transform for different parameters. The transformation could mask the effect of interventions unless time or parameter-specific markers are identifiable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
