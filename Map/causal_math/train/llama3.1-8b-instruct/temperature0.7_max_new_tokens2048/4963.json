  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = \\\\pi/2 \\\\) an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\), will the Fourier transform at time T > \\\\pi/2 reflect this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the fundamental frequency of the function from 1 to -1 at \\\\( t = \\\\pi/2 \\\\), which means the Fourier transform will now show a peak at -1 instead of 1, reflecting the change in the system's behavior due to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
