  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf partway through the evolution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is suddenly doubled, will the trajectory after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be identical to what it would have been without this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the frequency at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the angular velocity of rotation. Therefore, the trajectory after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will deviate from its original path, inducing a faster rotation around the complex origin thereafter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
