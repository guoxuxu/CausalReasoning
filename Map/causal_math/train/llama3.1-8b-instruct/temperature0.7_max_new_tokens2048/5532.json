  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations were applied (either \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on knowing the outcome \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 could be influenced by either transformation alone or both in conjunction, and these transformations could theoretically yield the same final state from different initial conditions and parameters due to their linear nature. Determining the exact sequence or type of interventions requires additional information beyond the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
