  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the state is evolved using a linear time-invariant differential equation described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The study will explore the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( F(x)(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the precise form of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( F(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform integrates the function across all time, altering it significantly, and the inversion process requires knowledge that \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied. Without this knowledge, recovering the exact initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( F(x)(T) \\\\) is indeterminable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
