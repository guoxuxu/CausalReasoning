  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2 \\\\) and its Laplace Transform, which transforms the function into the s-domain as \\\\( F(s) \\\\). We explore whether the transformed system under differently parameterized transformations still retains causal relationships.\n\nIf an initial value \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and evolved under the Laplace domain without intervention, will the inverse Laplace transform at any point s = s_1 give the direct mathematical evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a bijective linear operator for the sorts of elementary functions described, and performing operations in the s-domain equivalent to those in the x-domain maintains the causal structure due to the linearity and reversibility of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
