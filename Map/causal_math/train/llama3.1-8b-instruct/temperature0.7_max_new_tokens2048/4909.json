  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to become \\\\( z(0)^n \\\\), and then the output is given by \\\\( z(T) = (e^{iT})^n \\\\) for some \\\\( T > 0 \\\\), will this output match the transformation \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) directly applied at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) and the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) commute since the operation of raising to the power of \\\\( n \\\\) commutes under exponential growth. Thus, \\\\( z(t)^n = (e^{it})^n = e^{int} \\\\) will directly match the calculated \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
