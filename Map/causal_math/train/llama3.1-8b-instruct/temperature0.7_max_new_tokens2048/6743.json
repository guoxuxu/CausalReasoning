  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transformation \\\\(L(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\) on this dynamic.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the parameter \\\\(k\\\\) to \\\\(k'\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), while keeping \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) constant, will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\(L(z(t))\\\\) from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards be unaffected by the change in \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter \\\\(k\\\\) alters the system's dynamics as prescribed in the governing equation. Since the Laplace transform reflects changes in the system's state evolution due to its dependency on the entire function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), the transform from \\\\(t_1\\\\) onward will capture the effects of changing \\\\(k\\\\) to \\\\(k'\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
