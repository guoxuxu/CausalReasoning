  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled with a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) representing impedance, and a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) which converts time-domain functions into the s-domain. The action is analyzing the behavior of the current function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) when subjected to an input voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\).\n\nIf a filter characterized by a transformation \\\\( F(s) = s / (s + a) \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the new current \\\\( I'(t) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend strictly on the initial voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and not on the type of filter applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\) modifies the circuit characteristics, changing the response of the system to the initial voltage. The current at any time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will not only depend on the original voltage but also on the properties of the filter applied. Hence, both the initial conditions and the nature of the filter influence the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
