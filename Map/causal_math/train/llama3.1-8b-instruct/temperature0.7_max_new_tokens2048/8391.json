  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). Analyzing the impact of the inverse transformation given by \\\\( g(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) where \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied where a new Laplace transform function \\\\( H(s) = s^2F(s) \\\\) is used at a certain point, will the resulting function \\\\( h(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{H(s)\\\\} \\\\) strictly represent the second derivative of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), independent of the original transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( H(s) = s^2F(s) \\\\) leads to \\\\( h(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{H(s)\\\\} = f''(t) \\\\), which strictly represents the second derivative of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), operating independently from the first derivative transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\). This is a typical result of applying the Laplace transform property regarding differentiation in the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
