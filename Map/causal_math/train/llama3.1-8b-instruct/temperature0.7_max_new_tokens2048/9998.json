  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the transformation through \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) may have altered the initial conditions in a way that cannot be uniquely retraced, especially if D and C are such that they don't commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
