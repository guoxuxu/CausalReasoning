  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\) with A and B as constant matrices. We further examine the transformation dictated by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied on z(t), producing \\\\(Z(s)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a matrix transformation \\\\(D\\\\) is applied to alter the differential equation to \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Dv\\\\) at time t1, will \\\\(Z(T) = U(T) + iV(T)\\\\) only depend on the original matrices A and B and not on D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation matrix D fundamentally alters the system's dynamics post t1, thereby affecting both the real and imaginary parts of the endpoint \\\\(Z(T)\\\\). Thus, the final forms of \\\\(U(T)\\\\) and \\\\(V(T)\\\\) depend critically on D, in addition to A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
