  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{tt} = -\\Delta u + \\lambda u \\\\), where \\\\( \\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a scalar parameter. We explore the effect of an initial condition manipulation described by \\\\( u(0,x) = \\phi(x) \\\\) and an impulse transformation \\\\( u_t(0,x) = \\psi(x) \\\\), where \\\\(\\phi(x)\\\\) and \\\\(\\psi(x)\\\\) are specific functions.\n\nIf an intervention changes \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) to a new value \\\\( \\lambda' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) at T > t_1 still be predictable solely based on \\\\( \\phi(x) \\\\) and \\\\( \\psi(x) \\\\) set at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) alters the differential equation's behavior, thus impacting the subsequent evolution of the system. The final state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) incorporates effects from both the original and altered parameters, making it impossible to predict solely based on the initial conditions without accounting for the change in \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
