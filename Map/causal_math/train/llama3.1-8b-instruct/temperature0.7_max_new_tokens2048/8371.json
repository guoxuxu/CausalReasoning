  "Problem": "Consider an iterative linear system transformation defined by the equation \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) applied periodically over discrete time steps t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain discrete time \\\\( t_k \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x_N \\\\) for N > t_k depend only on M and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces another component influencing the system's trajectory, making the final state \\\\( x_N \\\\) dependent on M, D, and F. The modifications due to \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) both contribute to defining the new states leading up to \\\\( x_N \\\\), altering it from what would have been seen with just M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
