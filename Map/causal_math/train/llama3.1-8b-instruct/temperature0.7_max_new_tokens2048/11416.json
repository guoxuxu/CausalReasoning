  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We evaluate its behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used, based solely on knowing the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations and their effects on magnitude and phase complexity make it challenging to pinpoint the exact sequence or choice of interventions. Both transformations modify the trajectory in a non-linear way, resulting in potential overlaps of the final observed state from different paths and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
