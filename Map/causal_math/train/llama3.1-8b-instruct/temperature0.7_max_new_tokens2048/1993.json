  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Sz \\\\), where S is a constant matrix. The study focuses on the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) implemented at various times t, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Sz \\\\) up to time T without further modification, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be equivalent to direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Sz \\\\) until T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), which can alter the trajectory of the system. The effect of D on the system's evolution means the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), will differ unless D commutes with S or is zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
