  "Problem": "Consider a system that can be modeled using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing real and imaginary parts, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and the system evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) purely by observing the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied at any time before \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the effects of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) on the initial and evolving states are unknown, which may significantly alter the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This makes it impractical to uniquely infer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without this critical information.",
