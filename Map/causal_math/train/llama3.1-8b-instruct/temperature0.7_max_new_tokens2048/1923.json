  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T].\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta)t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) being a constant shift in frequency, will the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) still be independent of \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a change in frequency creating a different function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. Since the exponential terms differ post-intervention, the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) ultimately changes, reflecting the frequency change denoted by \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\). This leads to a different integral outcome due to the altered harmonic relationship in the exponential terms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
