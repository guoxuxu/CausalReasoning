  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect the effects on the function when it is subjected to a Fourier transformation, given by \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 \\), a transformation defined by \\( h(t) = t \\cdot z(t) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) prior to the Fourier transformation, will the resulting \\( F(h)(\\xi) \\) peak still primarily reflect the original \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(t) \\) alters \\( z(t) \\) by multiplying it with time \\( t \\), which introduces additional frequency components due to the modulation. This results in the derivation of different spectral characteristics in \\( F(h)(\\xi) \\), hence the peak frequency may shift or broaden, not reflecting the original \\( \\omega \\) exclusively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
