  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. The transformation function considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-it_1}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced just by the original differential equations irrespective of the transformations applied at t = 0 and t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the initial transformation as well as the mid-trajectory intervention. Both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduce rotational adjustments in the trajectory, which interact with the way the differential equations evolve the system state. As such, the result at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a composite outcome influenced by all factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
