  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(k) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) given by the integral transformation \\\\( F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} f(x) dx \\\\). We aim to evaluate how the application of a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\), defined as \\\\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\\\), influences the Fourier transformed function.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the final Fourier transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) resulting from the series of transformations and differentiations, can one uniquely determine the sequence of transformations and differentiations applied to the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences of operations can lead to the same final Fourier transform outcome, especially when non-linear transformations like \\\\( g(x) = x^2f(x) \\\\) are involved. These introduce ambiguities in phase and other transform properties, thus preventing a unique mapping back to the sequence of transformations and differentiations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
