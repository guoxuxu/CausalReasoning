  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under a linear transformation described by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) applied on the vector representation \\\\( (x, y) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(u) du \\) is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nUpon observing the result of the integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can one unequivocally determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) jointly determine the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus affecting the resultant value of \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( A \\\\), multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z(0) \\\\) could lead to the same observed \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\), thereby rendering the determination of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) not unique.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
