  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Assume the dynamic of the function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), with M being a constant 2x2 real matrix.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly establish the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), assuming no information about intermediate transformations (like \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Since the dynamics governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) are linear and the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{MT} \\\\) is invertible for non-singular M, we can uniquely resolve back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by employing the inverse transformation, \\\\( e^{-MT} z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
