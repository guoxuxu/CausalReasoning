  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore how the response of the system changes under the effect of external operators such as differentiation or integration over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain whether the function underwent differentiation, integration, or neither, solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different types of mathematical operations like differentiation or integration, each affecting the function's trajectory differently. Without additional information about the operations applied, it cannot be determined uniquely what interventions occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
