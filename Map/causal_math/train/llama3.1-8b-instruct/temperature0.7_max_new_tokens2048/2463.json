  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) where M is a complex constant matrix. The behavior of the system under the influence of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{N \\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with N being another complex matrix, is examined.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{P(\\\\tau-t_1)} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) (where P is a constant matrix) is applied, does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation which depends on P as well as the previously applied transformation through N. Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a result of the interactions among M, N, and increasingly P, deviating from solely depending on M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
