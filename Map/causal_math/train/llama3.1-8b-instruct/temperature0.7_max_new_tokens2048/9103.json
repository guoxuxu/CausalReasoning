  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nIf at some point the function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is replaced by a modified function \\\\(g(x) = b f(x)\\\\) where \\\\(b\\\\) is another scalar, and then \\\\(z(w)\\\\) is calculated, will the final \\\\(z(w)\\\\) be independent of the initial scalar \\\\(a\\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of changing \\\\(f(x)\\\\) to \\\\(g(x) = b f(x)\\\\) results in a such that \\\\\\\\(z(w)\\\\\\\\) computed afterward reflects combined effect of both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\). Therefore, the resulting transform \\\\(z(w)\\\\) depends on both scalars, not just one.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
