  "Problem": "Consider a system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves in time according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then letting this transformed state evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\).\n\nUpon observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether it was derived from an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly or from a Fourier transformed initial state \\\\( F(x_0) \\\\), when no knowledge of the transformation application is given?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information on whether a Fourier transform was applied, it is impossible to distinguish if \\\\( x(T) \\\\) resulted from an original \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or a Fourier transformed \\\\( F(x_0) \\\\). The transformation effects intrinsically modify the state's evolutionary path, making it infeasible to reconstruct the initial condition just from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
