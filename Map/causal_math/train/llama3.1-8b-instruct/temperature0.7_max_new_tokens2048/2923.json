  "Problem": "Assume we are analyzing a thermal system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = \\\\Delta u + c u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature distribution in a medium, \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\(c\\\\) is a heat source term. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\nIf a corrective Fourier-related intervention \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u) = e^{ikx}u\\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final frequency domain profile \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) and not on the initial conditions or the type of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u)\\\\), acting as a phase shift in the frequency space, affects the evolution by altering the original frequency components. This results in a final profile that depends on the initial conditions, the type of interventions applied, and the details of the differential operator \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\). Each component contributes to shaping the trajectory and final outcome in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
