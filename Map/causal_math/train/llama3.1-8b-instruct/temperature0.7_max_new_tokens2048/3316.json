  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is an analytic solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Evaluate how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) influences the system's behavior.\n\nCan the specific interventions (like frequency filtering based on initial \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\)) applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be precisely identified from observing the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the details of past interventions directly from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex because different manipulations could yield similar results at \\\\( T \\\\). The lack of exclusivity in how interventions map to results makes it impossible to uniquely back-calculate which specific operations were applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) based solely on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
