  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process where the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx = Ax \\\\, dt + B \\\\, dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) refers to a Wiener process increment. An operator \\\\( T_t \\\\) defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is constant is considered as a transformation.\n\nIf an intervention characterized by another matrix exponential transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_k \\\\), will the resulting end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of multiple transformations during the process's evolution, specifically the introduction of \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) at time \\\\( t_k \\\\), makes the final state dependent on the interactions among \\\\( A, C, \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). The overlapping effects of these matrices through their respective exponentials can significantly alter the trajectory from that of the original system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
