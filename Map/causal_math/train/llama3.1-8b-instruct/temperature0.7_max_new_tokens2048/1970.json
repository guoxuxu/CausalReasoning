  "Problem": "Investigate the interaction of a discrete dynamic system characterized by the linear mapping equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), in which M is a constant matrix. Consider the transformation induced by the function \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix that acts at a specific moment.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( x_N \\\\) at \\( n = N \\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) was applied, and considering the evolving mechanism \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the unknown application of D potentially modifies the initial state. There could be multiple candidates for \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
