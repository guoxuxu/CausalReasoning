  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex vectors and A and B are constant complex matrices. We explore the outcome when applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Ct}w(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) for a fixed time T, where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a new function \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) (where D is a complex matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( T[z] \\\\) for T > t_1 still reflect the effects of matrix C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the function from that point; however, the transformation \\\\( T[w] \\\\) still fully integrates the function up to time T. This integration encompasses effects from matrices A, B, C, and the newly introduced D on the endpoint, including continued influence from the transformation involving C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
