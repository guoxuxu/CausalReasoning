  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} + i \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds \\\\), where A is a constant and i represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of z when affected by transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\), where B is another constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original function at t=0 without knowing if transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied, the transformation can alter both magnitude and phase of z such that reverse-engineering to the exact original state \\( z(0) \\) is unattainable without additional information about B or the application of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
