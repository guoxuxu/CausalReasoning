  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the vector field is governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L \\{ v(t) \\} = sV(s) - v(0) \\), with \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) where A is a constant matrix. We'll examine the effects of perturbing this system with another transform \\( f(v) = e^{Bt}v \\) where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( f(v) \\) is applied to a vector \\( v_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( v(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( v_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(v) \\) modifies the initial conditions of the trajectory, and since \\( e^{Bt} \\) can change the dynamics based on B's characteristics relative to A, the state at time T under the influence of \\( f \\) is different from that of the unperturbed system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
