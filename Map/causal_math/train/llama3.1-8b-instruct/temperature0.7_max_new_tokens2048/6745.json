  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \\\\), used as a transformation within the context of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). The system investigates how transformations affect the Laplace transform of the function over the variable s.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is transformed via \\\\( T \\\\) at s = 1, will the transformed function \\\\( h(s) = T[g](s) \\\\) at s = 1 remain affected if the function form or the value of s changes to s = 2 without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) is dependent on the value of s due to its definition through the exponential factor in the Laplace transform. Changing s from 1 to 2 alters the exponential decay rate, impacting the resulting transform distinctly even if g(z) remains the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
