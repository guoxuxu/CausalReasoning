  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then Fourier transformed without any further intervention, will the form of \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\) at a later time t = T be equivalent to that obtained by directly Fourier transforming \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) without applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) influences the initial function by damping it exponentially, which alters the spectral components of the function. As a result, the Fourier transform will also be modified, showing different characteristics compared to the direct transformation of the unaltered \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
