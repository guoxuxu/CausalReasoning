  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) is the wave function and H is the Hamiltonian operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iK} \\\\psi \\\\), with K being a constant operator, is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\), \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) could potentially be reached by several different pathways, involving different combinations and orders of applying \\\\( e^{iK} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iL} \\\\), and because these transformations only affect the phase rather than altering measurable probabilities directly, it is not possible to distinguish between different historical application sequences of K and L solely based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
