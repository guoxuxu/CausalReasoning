  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the heat diffusion over a plane is studied. The temperature distribution is represented by the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), which satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. The experiment manipulates this distribution via a sudden localized heating at point \\\\( x_0 \\\\), represented by the function \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely if the localized heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the cooling at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) both occurred, just by observing the temperature at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution can potentially result from various configurations of initial and intervening heating or cooling effects. Other factors such as alternative heat sources, variations in thermal diffusivities, or different initial conditions may result in a similar distribution, obscuring the clarity of causal inference from terminal observations alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
