  "Problem": "Considering a complex function and its transformation by a linear operator, let \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) be a time-dependent complex function. The linear operator \\( L \\) acts on \\( z \\) such that \\( L(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the initial function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) is transformed by \\( L \\) and then evolves under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the resultant function at time \\( T \\) be the same as if \\( z(t) \\) was simply evolved to \\( T \\) under its native dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The action of the linear operator \\( L \\) integrates and scales \\( z(t) \\) with the exponential factor \\( e^{At} \\), which modifies the growth or decay behavior of the original function \\( z(t) \\). This leads to a fundamentally different trajectory and final state at time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
