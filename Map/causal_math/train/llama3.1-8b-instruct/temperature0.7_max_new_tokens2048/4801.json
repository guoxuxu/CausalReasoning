  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = f(x_0, y_0) \\\\) at t = 0, and the output is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the mapping of \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at t = T under \\\\( g^T(z) \\\\) where \\\\( g^T \\\\) denotes the T-th iterate of \\\\( g \\\\), be predictable?",
  "Explanation": "The iterates of the complex transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) can lead to highly unpredictable and sensitive outcomes, depending on the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the parameter c. This often results in chaotic behavior typical in the study of complex dynamics such as that observed in fractals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
