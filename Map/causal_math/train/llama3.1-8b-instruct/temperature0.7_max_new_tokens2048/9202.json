  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where the function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), with C being a real constant. The evolution of the system is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the accumulated impact of the integration and the phase shifts introduced by \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obscure the ability to reverse engineer to the function's original state at t = 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
