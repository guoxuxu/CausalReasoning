  "Problem": "Investigate the system described by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant. We apply transformations using the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and study the effect at time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\) at time \\( T \\) from an evolved system under \\( e^{at} \\), can it be determined whether a transformation \\( F(s) \\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific function \\( F(s) \\) and without additional information on the evolution process, it is not possible to confirm whether a transformation was applied initially, as multiple transformations could lead to similar states at \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
