  "Problem": "Assume we have a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a fixed matrix. Consider analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the system's response function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), hoping to infer causal relations.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Laplace Transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = T, assuming no interventions and that the system is left to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace Transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and knowing the dynamics defined by D, the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) can be uniquely determined, assuming the system matrix D allows for inversion or is well-defined to reverse the Laplace Transform and recover \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
