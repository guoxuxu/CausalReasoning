  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nBy observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), you cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The non-linear nature of the differential equation and the potential modification by the integral operator prevent reverse deducing the original state uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
