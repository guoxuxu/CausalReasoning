  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with conductivity k. An initial heating pattern v(x) is applied as an initial condition and after a time period, a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x,t)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is a heating function, is introduced.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution u(x,T) at time T, can we precisely determine the initial temperature distribution v(x) without knowing whether any transformation g(u) was applied during the period?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation g(u) = u + h(x,t) was applied at any time, it's not possible to accurately deduce the initial temperature pattern v(x) from the final distribution u(x,T), as any additional heat input h(x,t) would alter the evolution unpredictably.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
