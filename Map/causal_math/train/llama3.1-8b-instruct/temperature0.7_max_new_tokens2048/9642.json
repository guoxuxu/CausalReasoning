  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. The causal implications are explored by applying a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) to the system.\n\nCan the original initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\) knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), but not the time path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and the Laplace transform of the output, it is possible to uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). This stems from the ability of the Laplace transform to encode initial conditions within its form, making the initial state recoverable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
