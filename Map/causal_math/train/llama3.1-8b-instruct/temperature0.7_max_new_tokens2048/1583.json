  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The system is subject to the operation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( g(z) = e^{zt} \\\\) is introduced, will the final Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial function shape without considering the effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{zt} \\\\) introduces a significant exponential factor influencing both the growth rate and the oscillation pattern of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This change alters the original function's behavior substantially, thus affecting the resultant transform. Consequently, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\) reflects the influence of both the initial function shape and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
