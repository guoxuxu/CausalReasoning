  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modulation by \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another real constant) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be independent of \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces an additional frequency component to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) reflected in its transform. The resulting Fourier transform will have contributions from both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), manifesting as additional frequency components or shifts, thus making it dependent on \\\\( C \\\\) as well as \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
