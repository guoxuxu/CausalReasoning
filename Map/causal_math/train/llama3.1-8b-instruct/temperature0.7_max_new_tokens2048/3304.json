  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving an integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. In this context, assume that \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), with A being a real constant. Further assume that the Laplace transform is uniquely invertible.\n\nBased on the altered transform result after changing s, can we accurately reconstruct the original value of A?",
  "Explanation": "With an altered s without knowledge of its prior value, the transformation relationship becomes obscured. The result might not uniquely identify A due to the fundamental alteration in the relationship introduced by changing s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
