  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a phase shift transformation \\\\( z'(t) = z(t)e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\) at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant phase shift, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be different from \\\\( z(T)e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\phi} \\\\) is a linear operator that commutes with the time evolution operator \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Therefore, the transformation merely adjusts the initial phase, and the final conditions at any time T will still align with applying the phase shift directly to \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
