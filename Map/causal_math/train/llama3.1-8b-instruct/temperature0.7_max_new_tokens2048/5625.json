  "Problem": "Analyze a controlled system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{t} + cu_{x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. A transformation is considered, defined by \\\\( g(u) = U(x,t) \\\\) where U is an integrating factor related to u, potentially altering the system dynamics.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve according to the given PDE without further intervention, does \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) at t = T remain unaltered as compared to simply evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) to t = T under the untransformed equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) alters the dynamics since \\\\( U(x,t) \\\\) introduces new factors into the PDE. Depending on the nature of U relative to u, the solution at t = T would reflect these changes, leading to an altered state from what would have been achieved with the original untransformed PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
