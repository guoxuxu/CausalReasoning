  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nBy examining the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt} \\\\) may have radically changed the initial state. The effect of N on the evolution path is critical, and without this information, the inverse transformation cannot be precisely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
