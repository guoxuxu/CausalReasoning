  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system's evolution is governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a positive real constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the evolution rule to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega' z \\\\) at some time t > 0, where \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t depend on the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency of the rotation but the phase and magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at the moment of intervention depend on how \\\\( z \\\\) evolved up to that time under the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
