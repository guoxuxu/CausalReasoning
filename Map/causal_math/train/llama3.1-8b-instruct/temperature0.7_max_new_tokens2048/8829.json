  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a Laplace transform used on a physical system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, \\\\( x \\\\) is the position, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( L(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 undergoes the heat equation evolution without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at any later time t simply represent the natural evolution of \\\\( L(u_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the temperature distribution over time involves an integral transformation influencing the entire function space of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\). The initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) contributes to, but does not fully determine, the transformed function due to the ongoing adjustment of the temperature via the heat distribution equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
