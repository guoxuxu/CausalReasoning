  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) \\\\), which changes the domain from time-space to frequency-time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 remain dependent solely on the linear operator L and not on the effects of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the inverse Fourier transform transforms the function back to the spatial domain, wherein it continues to evolve solely under the influence of L. Since the Fourier transform and its inverse are linear and mutually inverse operations, they essentially reset the function's representation by t_1, leaving only L to influence the subsequent evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
