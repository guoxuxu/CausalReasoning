  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. This scenario examines the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\), with \\\\( P \\\\) being another constant complex matrix, on the system's evolution over time.\n\nCan you deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 solely from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Unless it is known whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\) was applied, the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be unequivocally determined based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The potential alteration by \\\\( P \\\\) affects the backward calculation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
