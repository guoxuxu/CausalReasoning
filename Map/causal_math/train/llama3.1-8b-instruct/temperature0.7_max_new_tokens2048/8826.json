  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\pi / \\\\omega_0, without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's unclear whether \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{kz_0} \\\\) was the starting point. Both scenarios can lead to different trajectories, making the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) indeterminable from just the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
