  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nKnowing only the transformed result \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - (w + q)) \\\\), can we accurately trace back and distinguish whether the original function was transformed or phase-shifted?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform result of a shifted delta function does not specify whether the shift was due to an original different frequency in \\\\( z(x) \\\\) or a subsequent phase-shift operation. Both scenarios yield indistinguishable transformations in this setup, demonstrating an inability to differentiate past operations based solely on the final transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
