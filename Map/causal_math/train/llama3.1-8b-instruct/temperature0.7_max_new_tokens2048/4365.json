  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in integral calculus defined as \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) where g is a continuously differentiable function. We analyze the impact of changing variables from x to u in the definite integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( du = g'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf a variable transformation \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) is applied to the integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), and then the transformed integral is solved directly, will the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(g^{-1}(u)) \\\\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(u))} \\\\, du \\\\) be the same as the original integral?",
  "Explanation": "The change of variables in an integral, if done correctly by replacing \\\\( dx \\\\) with \\\\( du/g'(x) \\\\) and transforming the limits accordingly, will yield the same result as the original integral. The transformation preserves the integral’s value, assuming correct adjustments for bounds and differential elements.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
