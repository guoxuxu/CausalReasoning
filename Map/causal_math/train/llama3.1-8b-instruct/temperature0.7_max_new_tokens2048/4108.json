  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We examine the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by observing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The various transformations applied at different times can lead to similar or even identical states at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially in non-linear or complex systems where interactions are non-commutative. Determining the precise nature of interventions used solely based on the endpoint is fundamentally indeterminate due to the wide range of possibilities in the state evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
