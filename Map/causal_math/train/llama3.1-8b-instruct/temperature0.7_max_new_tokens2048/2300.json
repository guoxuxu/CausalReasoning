  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the final convoluted function, can we determine the exact sequence and type of interventions (convolutions with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\)) used, solely by examining the output?",
  "Explanation": "The output resulting from consecutive convolutions with Gaussian kernels cannot uniquely determine the sequence of convolutions due to the cumulative and similar effects of Gaussian convolutions on the function. Different sequences of applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could yield statistically close or identical results, hence making it infeasible to precisely backtrack the convolution sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
