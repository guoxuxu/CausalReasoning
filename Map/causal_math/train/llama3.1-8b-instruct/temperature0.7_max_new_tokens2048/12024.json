  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation represented by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iws} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then the resulting function is left to evolve under the same \\\\( f(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without additional transformations, does this reproduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) fundamentally changes the function by integrating it with a complex exponential factor. This operation results in a different function representation, which does not transform back into \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely by further evolution under \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
