  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a system's state over time. The Laplace Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the effect of applying an input function \\\\( u(t) = e^{st} \\\\) to this system, particularly considering how intervention could impact temporal dynamics.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( u(t) \\\\), \\\\( v(t) \\\\), or both) by examining \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) encodes information about both the system's natural response and the effects of any interventions in a combined manner. Due to the nature of transformation and potential overlap in effects, identifying specific contributions from \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
