  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a fixed complex vector, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number. The function governs the time evolution in a complex function space and represents a circular motion in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the given function without any intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some time T be uniquely determined by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\), not depending on \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) explicitly depends on the values of \\\\( T \\\\) as it appears in the exponential term, indicating a direct dependency on the time variable for determining the state in the complex function space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
