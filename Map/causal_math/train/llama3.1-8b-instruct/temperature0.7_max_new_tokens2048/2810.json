  "Problem": "A function optimization process utilizes a Gaussian integral transformation with \\\\( G(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\). This function is utilized to optimize another function \\\\( H(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 \\\\) over its domain.\n\nCan we infer the form of \\\\( H(x) \\\\) by analyzing the output of the transformed function without knowing the applied transformation \\\\( G(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\( G(x) \\\\) applied, it is not feasible to accurately determine the original form of \\\\( H(x) \\\\) simply from the output. The transformation could significantly modify the appearance and properties of the resulting function, obscuring information about the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
