  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We study the implications of a Laplace transformation given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) on this function over the complex variable z.\n\nIf we modify the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\) by changing A to B and apply the Laplace transformation at a later point, will the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\) depend only on the new matrix B without any influence of A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention where A is replaced by B means the new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\) is distinct from the original and varies only due to B when transformed. The effect of A is completely overridden by B in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modification of A → Change in function f; Change in function f → Application of Laplace transformation; Modification of A → Application of Laplace transformation; Application of Laplace transformation → Outcome L(g)(s); Change in function f → Outcome L(g)(s); B → Outcome L(g)(s)"
