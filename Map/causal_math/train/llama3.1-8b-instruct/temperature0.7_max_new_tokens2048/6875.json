  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and K is a complex constant matrix. Let the transformation function be \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another complex constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\) and not on A or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) impacts the system, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a function of the initial state modification by A, subsequent evolution dynamics, and the intervention by C. This results in a dependency on A, C, and the original dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
