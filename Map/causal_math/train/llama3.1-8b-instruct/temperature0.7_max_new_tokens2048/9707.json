  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention changes the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform still be representable as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency change intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards. The final Laplace transform will be affected by both segments of the function pre- and post-intervention, leading to a form that cannot purely be represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
