  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf during the evaluation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) a new constant \\\\( R \\\\) is introduced changing the equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P+R)z + Q \\\\), will the subsequent values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original constants \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\), and not on the intervention by \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( R \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) significantly alters the differential equation, causing a change in the system's dynamics subsequently. This means the future values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will also depend on \\\\( R \\\\), not just \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
