  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). We investigate how modifying the original function impacts its Laplace transform, and vice versa, particularly focusing on an exponential function applied as \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( h(t) = e^{-bt}f(t) \\\\) (with a new constant \\\\( b \\\\)), will the new transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be independent of the original transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) applied in \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation creates \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{-bt}f(t))(s) = F(s+b) \\\\). Since it depends on the transformed form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) rather than the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\), any earlier transformations (including the exponential parameter \\\\( a \\\\)) affecting the initial function will influence the resulting transform, leading to dependency on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
