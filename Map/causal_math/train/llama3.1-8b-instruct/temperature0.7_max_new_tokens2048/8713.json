  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) is transformed to the matrix \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), will the eigenvalues remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\) is a similarity transformation, which preserves the eigenvalues of the matrix. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \\\\( A \\\\) will be the same as those of \\\\( T(A) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation of matrix A → Change in eigenvectors; Invertibility of matrix B → Existence of B^-1; Invertibility of matrix B → Existence of B; Change in eigenvectors → Change in eigenvalues; Invertibility of matrix B → B^-1AB has the same eigenvalues as A; Transformation of matrix A → B^-1AB has the same eigenvalues as A; A has real symmetric matrix → A has real eigenvalues; A has real symmetric matrix → A has orthogonal eigenvectors; A has orthogonal eigenvectors → Eigenvectors can be used to diagonalize A; Eigenvectors can be used to diagonalize A → Transformation of matrix A has the same eigenvectors as A; Transformation of matrix A → T(A) has the same eigenvalues as A"
