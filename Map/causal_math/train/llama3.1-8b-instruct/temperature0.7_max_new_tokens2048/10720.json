  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function operates in a space undergoing changes described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), with A being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it definitive to identify which interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of transformations (and neither), due to the properties of complex exponential growth and potential compensative effects between \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). Thus, identifying the exact interventions applied solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
