  "Problem": "Let the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Consider an intervention where a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i \\theta t}z + c \\\\), with constants \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), is applied.\n\nIf at a certain time t1, a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\phi t}z + b \\\\) (where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 relate solely to the values influenced by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional influencing variables into the dynamical system's trajectory. The final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) would now be resultant from all three modifying terms, making it dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\theta \\\\), and \\\\( \\phi \\\\), along with the additive constants \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). This leads to a composite effect that blends all disparate factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
