  "Problem": "Imagine a system where the temperature distribution on a plate is modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), and as an experiment, a function \\\\( h(u) = e^{-kt}u \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at different times to alter the temperature pattern.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a separate function \\\\( j(u) = u + et \\\\) (where \\\\( e \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the properties of the Laplace equation and not on the interventions \\\\( h(u) \\\\) or \\\\( j(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( j(u) \\\\) introduces an additive alteration to the temperature, modifying the steady-state differently from what would have been achieved by purely evolving under the Laplace equation. Thus, the final temperature distribution depends critically on both interventions and the properties of the equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
