  "Problem": "Investigate the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( j(x) = x + d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a complex number) is applied, will the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend exclusively on the value of \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\) or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( j(x) \\\\) as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further modifies the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent not just on the constant \\\\( k \\\\) but also significantly on \\\\( c \\\\) from the initial transformation and \\\\( d \\\\) from the intervention. Each element contributes uniquely to the resulting complex pathway.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
