  "Problem": "Consider a heat transfer system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = a^2u_{xx}\\\\) (typical heat equation) in a rod, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant diffusivity property of the rod. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(x,t)) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and then solving the equation in the transform domain.\n\nIf we apply the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x) = u(x, 0)\\\\) and solve the transformed equation without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) at t = T match the solution obtained by directly solving the PDE for \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Solving the heat equation via its Fourier transform and then applying the inverse transform computes the same solution as solving the original PDE directly due to the linearity and transformational properties of the Fourier transform. The transforms do not alter the fundamental properties of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
