  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time under the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) for a matrix C.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial function form \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the impact of the integration transformation obscures the original state because the influence of \\\\( e^{C\\\\tau} \\\\) on z during the interval from 0 to T modifies the path and endpoints in a non-reversible manner, especially when C does not commute with A or B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
