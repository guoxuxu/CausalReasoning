  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is driven by a voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\). The relationship is governed by a linear differential equation involving a convolution with the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) of the circuit. We analyze how the response changes if we modify the signal using a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{V(t)\\\\} = \\\\tilde{V}(s) \\\\), apply a filter defined by a function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then take the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{ F(s)\\\\tilde{V}(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the form of the original voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\) used at t = 0 directly from the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) observed at time T, without knowing whether filtering was applied through \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original voltage source. The filtering could have altered the frequency components of \\\\( V(t) \\\\), and hence the observed \\\\( I(t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple different possible input configurations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
