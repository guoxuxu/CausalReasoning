  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be deduced solely from knowing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), where T > 0, without any additional system information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) represents an integral of the system's state influenced by the exponential function, it encompasses a range of states from \\\\( 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\ ) rather than a specific state at a specific time. This integration masks the direct influence of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by including all prior states, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
