  "Problem": "Assess the causal relationship in a vector field defined by \\\\( z(x, t) = Ax + tBx \\\\) where A and B are fixed matrices and x is an input vector. An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{sC}z(x, s) ds \\\\) is applied to z(x, t), involving a matrix C.\n\nWill the properties of the matrix A solely determine the output \\\\( T(z) \\\\) after applying the transformation over the interval [0, T], assuming only the initial setup without further interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T(z) \\\\), is affected not just by A but also by B and C through the dependencies in the integral transformation. The addition of tBx and modulation by e^{sC} ensures that matrices B and C also significantly influence the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
