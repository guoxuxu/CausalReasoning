  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a system's state over time. The Laplace Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the effect of applying an input function \\\\( u(t) = e^{st} \\\\) to this system, particularly considering how intervention could impact temporal dynamics.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( v(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) (where k is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the original dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions (\\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) affect the state of the system and hence influence the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The transformations superpose in the complex function space, contributing distinct terms to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) that reflect the combined effects of the dynamics and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
