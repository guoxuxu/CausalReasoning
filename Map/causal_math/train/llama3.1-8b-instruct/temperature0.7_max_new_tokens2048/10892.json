  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) applied on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Further, investigate the causal relationship when we apply an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\{ G(\\\\omega) \\\\} = g(t) \\\\) on a frequency domain representation \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final form of the function \\\\( f'(t) \\\\) after modifications by \\\\( M(s) \\\\), can we determine the specific nature of \\\\( M(s) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( f'(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( M(s) \\\\) from \\\\( f'(t) \\\\) would require deconvolution with the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\), which can be highly sensitive to errors and assumptions about \\\\( f(t) \\\\). In practical scenarios, without precise knowledge of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or additional constraints on \\\\( M(s) \\\\), it's challenging to recover \\\\( M(s) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( f'(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
