  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We study the effect of the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse transformation using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) rather than \\\\( a \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is first applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and then the inverse Laplace transform is applied using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\), will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the time domain exactly represent the initial function governed by \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) in the inverse transform alters the properties of the function in the time domain, resulting in a function that represents \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\) instead of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). Therefore, the time domain function will not accurately represent the initial condition dictated by \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
