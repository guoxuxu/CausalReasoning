  "Problem": "Analyze a climate model where temperature (T) at time t is given by \\\\( T(t) = T_0 e^{kt} \\\\), where T_0 is initial temperature and k is a growth rate parameter. A study is performed to understand the impact of a carbon emission reduction strategy represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-rt}T(t) \\\\), where r is the rate of emission reduction.\n\nIf the carbon emission reduction strategy \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is not applied and the system is allowed to evolve from \\\\( T_0 \\\\) without intervention, will the temperature at time t be the same as if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 and the model allowed to evolve under its natural parameters?",
  "Explanation": "Without the intervention of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the temperature would evolve solely based on the natural growth factor \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), resulting in higher temperatures than with the reduction strategy. The intervention modifies the exponential growth by a decreasing exponential factor due to emission reduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
