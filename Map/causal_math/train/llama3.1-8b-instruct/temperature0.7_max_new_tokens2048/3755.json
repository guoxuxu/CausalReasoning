  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an additional exponential decay \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform, will the result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The composition of \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) prior to the Laplace Transform changes the resulting function to \\\\( Z(s) = x\\frac{1}{s+\\alpha-i\\omega} \\\\). This reveals that both \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) influence the outcome, showing dependency on the decay rate \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) as well as the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
