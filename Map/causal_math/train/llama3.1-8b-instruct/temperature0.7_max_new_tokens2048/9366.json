  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The function undergoes a Laplace transform and subsequent inverse Laplace transform, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) after observing its Laplace transformed version \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without knowing the value of A?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the Laplace transform is reversible, the value of \\\\( A \\\\) in the exponent is essential to uniquely determine the original function. Different values of \\\\( A \\\\) could potentially produce different functions that may have similar or indistinct transformed representations under certain conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
