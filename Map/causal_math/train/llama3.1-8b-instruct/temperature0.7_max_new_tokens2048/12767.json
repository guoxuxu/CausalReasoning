  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\) represented by matrix \\( M \\), and its impact on a complex function \\( z(t) \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}v \\), where \\( v \\) is a constant vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) and \\( \\omega \\) a real number. We explore how the application of Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) and its subsequent inverse alter the original function.\n\nGiven the function \\( z(T) \\) at a specific time T, is it possible to determine whether any transformations by \\( T \\) or the application of Laplace transform and its inverse were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant \\( z(T) \\) could be due to the effects of \\( M \\), or due to manipulations arising from Laplace transform operations. Without precise insights into \\( M \\) or clear knowledge about when and how the Laplace transforms were applied, multiple interpretations are possible, thus making it difficult to ascertain the sequence or type of intervention applied uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
