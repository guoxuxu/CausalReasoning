  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear operator describing the system's inductance matrix. Analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\(\\phi(V) = e^{Mt}V\\), where \\(M\\) is another inductance matrix, on the voltage \\(V\\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf \\(\\phi(V)\\) is applied to \\(V_0\\) at \\(t=0\\) and then the system evolves under \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\) without further intervention, will \\(V(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) be identical to the direct evolution of \\(V_0\\) under \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\) to \\(t = T\\) without applying \\(\\phi(V)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\(\\phi(V) = e^{Mt}V_0\\) at \\(t=0\\) changes the initial state, which will affect how the system evolves according to \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\). The function \\(e^{Mt}\\) can fundamentally alter the dynamics of the system depending on how \\(M\\) and \\(L\\) are related, leading to a different \\(V(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) than if \\(V_0\\) were evolved directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
