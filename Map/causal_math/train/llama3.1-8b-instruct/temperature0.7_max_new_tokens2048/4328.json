  "Problem": "Consider a circuit system described by the integral \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-sA} x(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix that represents system parameters and \\( x(t) \\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the input signal using a transformation defined by \\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing only \\( y(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied to \\( x(t) \\) during its evolution, specifically identifying whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both were used?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( y(T) \\) could potentially arise from various combinations of interventions due to the integrative nature of the system and the non-trivial effects of matrix exponentials \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) on the input. Distinguishing between single or multiple transformations based solely on the final state \\( y(T) \\) is challenged by the overlapping potential effects of different intervention setups.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → y(t); A → y(t); B → y(t); x(t) → f(x); B → f(x); x(t) → g(x); g(x) is not explicitly defined, so there is no direct causal link, however, it's implied that g(x) is a function of x(t), so x(t) → g(x)"
