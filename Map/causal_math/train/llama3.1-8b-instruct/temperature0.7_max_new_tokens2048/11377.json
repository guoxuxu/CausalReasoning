  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed into the s-domain using the Laplace transform, with no further intervention, does the resulting function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), adequately capture the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over all time t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, being a linear integral transformation, correctly maps the time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the complex frequency-domain function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Assuming all initial conditions are captured and the function behaves well enough for the transform to converge, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) should adequately represent the system behavior in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
