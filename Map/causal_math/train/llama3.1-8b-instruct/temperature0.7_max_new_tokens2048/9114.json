  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) ds\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is an input function altering the state. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\), where C is a constant matrix transformation applied to the input.\n\nHaving observed the system outcome \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original input function \\\\(u(s)\\\\) over [0, T] without knowing whether transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\(u(s)\\\\) from \\\\(y(t)\\\\) without knowing about the application of \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is not feasible, as the transformation can significantly alter the input, leading to ambiguity in retrieving the exact form of \\\\(u(s)\\\\) based solely on the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
