  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) introduce additional dynamics to the system. This makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interplay between all involved matrices A, B, C, and D, affecting the trajectory in complex ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
