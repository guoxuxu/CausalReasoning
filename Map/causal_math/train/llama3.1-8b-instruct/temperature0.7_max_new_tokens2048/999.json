  "Problem": "Consider the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in a flat, thin rod over time \\\\(t\\\\), governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the rod material. We investigate the impact of a change in boundary conditions defined by the step-function \\\\(\\\\phi(x) = T \\\\) (constant temperature) applied at one end of the rod.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new boundary condition \\\\(\\\\psi(x) = S\\\\) (another constant temperature) is applied at both ends of the rod, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the initial boundary condition \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new boundary condition \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\) will have a significant effect on the evolution of the temperature distribution after \\\\(t_1\\\\). The state of the system at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will depend heavily on both boundary conditions due to the compound effect and alteration of thermal gradients by \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
