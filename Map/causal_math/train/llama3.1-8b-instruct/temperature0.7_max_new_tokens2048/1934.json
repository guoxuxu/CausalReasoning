  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system where the stock price follows a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is the drift rate, \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) the volatility, and \\\\( dW \\\\) a Brownian motion increment. We apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) to transform the probability density function of the stock price.\n\nCan we deduce the original probability density function at t = 0 directly from the characteristic function at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge that a Fourier transform was applied, reconstructing the original probability density from its characteristic function involves assumptions about initial transformations and conditions. Uncertainty about whether the transform was applied complicates direct inversion to retrieve the original form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Brownian motion increment (dW) → Stock price (S); Drift rate (μ) → Stock price (S); Volatility (σ) → Stock price (S); Stock price (S) → Fourier transform (F); Fourier transform (F) → Characteristic function; Characteristic function → Stock price (S) at t=0; Stock price (S) at t=0 → Original probability density function; Characteristic function → Original probability density function"
