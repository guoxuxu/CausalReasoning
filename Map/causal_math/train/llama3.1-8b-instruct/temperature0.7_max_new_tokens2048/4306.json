  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. We analyze the system under a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAfter obtaining the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if no information on modifications or initial conditions is given?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a bijective operation for classes of functions typically studied in engineering and physics, which means each frequency-domain representation corresponds uniquely to one time-domain function. Thus, if you have \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\), you can uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
