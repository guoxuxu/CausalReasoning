  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time and represent the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The function is subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), and the transformed function is \\\\(Z(s)\\\\). We also consider the effect of multiplying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by a factor of \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant, before transforming.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing whether it was multiplied by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), it's unclear whether to adjust for the shift in \\\\(s\\\\). Consequently, inferring \\\\(z(t)\\\\) just from \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) is ambiguous, as the original function might have been \\\\(z(t)e^{at}\\\\) or simply \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
