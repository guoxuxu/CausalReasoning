  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\( S(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of modifying this system using another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) over time t, where M is a transformation matrix that describes an intervention.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) knowing that no transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "If no intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\) has taken place, the trajectory is purely the result of the transformation \\\\( Dx \\\\). Knowing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the properties of matrix D, allows us to reliably compute the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
