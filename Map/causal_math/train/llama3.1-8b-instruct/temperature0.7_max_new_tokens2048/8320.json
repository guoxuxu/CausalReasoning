  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\) with constants \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). Analysis investigates how operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can deduce properties or behaviors of functions over time and under transformations.\n\nCan we determine if either parameter \\\\( a \\\\) or degree \\\\( n \\\\) was specifically targeted by an intervention just by examining the updated form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), without knowing the specific form of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The changes in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) may reflect adjustments in \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\), or both, since both alterations would revise the Laplace transform's form and convergence properties. Identifying which parameter was altered specifically requires additional information beyond the transform's updated presentation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
