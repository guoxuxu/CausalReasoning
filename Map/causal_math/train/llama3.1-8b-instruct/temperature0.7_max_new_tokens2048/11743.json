  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations evolving over time given by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The impact of a Laplace Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))(s) \\\\), is investigated, where s represents a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(s, T) \\\\), is it possible to identify unequivocally whether the modification \\\\( M \\\\) or another intervention was applied just by analyzing the Laplace transformed function?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(s, T) \\\\) exhibits the combined effects of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), the specific type or presence of interventions like \\\\( M \\\\) are not always decipherable solely from \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(s, T) \\\\). The effects of different interventions can overlap, and without additional information, the causal inference is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
