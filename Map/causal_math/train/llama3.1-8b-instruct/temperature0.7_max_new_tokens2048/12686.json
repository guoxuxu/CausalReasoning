  "Problem": "We consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the impact of a transformation \\( h(z) = Mz \\) applied at time t, where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( q(z) = Nz \\) (where N is another transformation matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\( t_1 \\) with the function \\( q(z) \\) introduces an additional modification via N, altering the trajectory further based on \\( N \\), \\( M \\), and \\( D \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) results from the compounded effects of these transformations, thus not relying solely on \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
