  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are complex variables and the function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\). Here, A and B are constant matrices. We assess how the sequence of partial differentiation with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and their integrations influence the outcome.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(x, y) = e^{Cx + Dy} \\\\) (where C and D are constant matrices) is applied post initial derivatives, and prior to re-integration, will the result depend solely on the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation introduces new matrices, C and D, altering the original function significantly. The final output will now depend on all four matrices A, B, C, and D. The interaction between these matrices adds layers of complexity that change the final outcome distinctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
