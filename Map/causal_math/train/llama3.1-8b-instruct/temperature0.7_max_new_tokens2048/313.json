  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) modifies the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\). The properties of the equation and the effect of the complex constant matrix \\\\( M \\\\) result in a different trajectory, leading to a different state at time T.",
