  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its impact on an integral transform described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore how the Laplace Transform of this function changes under different scenarios.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be deduced by observing the poles of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after transformation without information about the initial value?",
  "Explanation": "The poles of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) are directly influenced by the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) due to the relation \\\\( s = -i\\\\omega \\\\). Observing the location of the poles can thus reveal the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), even without knowing the exponential term's initial phase or magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
