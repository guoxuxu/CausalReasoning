  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We are evaluating whether the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) applied to this function affects its causal inference properties.\n\nAfter observing the resultant Laplace transform from a modified system where \\\\( a \\\\) was changed partway through to \\\\( b \\\\), can we determine exactly when the change occurred and what the exact values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) were?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform integrates the combined effect over all time, significantly condensing information about distinct phases and their transition. Without additional temporal markers or constraints, reconstructing the precise timing of the shift and quantifying \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) exactly from the Laplace transform alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "change in a → change in z(t); change in z(t) → Laplace transformation; Laplace transformation → change in a; Laplace transformation → change in b; change in b → change in z(t); change in z(t) → modified system; modified system → observation; observation → determination of when change occurred; observation → determination of a and b values"
