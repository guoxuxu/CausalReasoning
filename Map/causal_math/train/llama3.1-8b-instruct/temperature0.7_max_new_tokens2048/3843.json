  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where C is a complex constant, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the consequences of an integral transformation on this system, denoted by \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda (t-\\\\tau)} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a decay factor.\n\nIf during the system’s evolution at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), we apply another transformation \\\\(T_{\\\\mu}[z](t)\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is another decay constant), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not any of the transformations ((\\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the second decay factor \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) at a specific time modifies the trajectory by applying a different weighting to the integral. Thus, the resultant state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on the complex interactions of both decay factors along with the original dynamics imposed by \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
