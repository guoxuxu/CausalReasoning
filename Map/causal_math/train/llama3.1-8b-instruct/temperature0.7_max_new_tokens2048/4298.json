  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the system's behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\), where M is another constant matrix and S is a matrix that diagonalizes D, i.e., \\\\( SDS^{-1} = \\\\Lambda \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\Lambda \\\\) being a diagonal matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) of the system, can we exactly infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "When the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) could have been applied, the influence of \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Mt}S \\\\) complicates reversal to the original state due to changes it imposes that are dependent not only on D but also on M. Without concrete knowledge of whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied, and details about M, it is impossible to confidently backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
