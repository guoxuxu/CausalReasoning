  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(x, t) = e^{tx}i\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real parameter, evolving over time according to the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the complex function is applied to \\\\(x\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(x\\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\) without applying \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying \\\\(e^{tx}i\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), the initial condition of \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) is fundamentally altered to \\\\(z(x, 0) = e^{0x}i = i\\\\). The future state \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) evolves from this modified initial condition, influenced by exponential growth driven by \\\\(a\\\\), thus resulting in a state that deviates from the natural evolution of \\\\(x\\\\) without initial transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
