  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the set of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The impact of applying the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T]. A, B, C, and D are constant matrices.\n\nIf another integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T=outcomely depend solely on the differential equations without being influenced by the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a new transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) will further modify the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) a function of not merely A, B, C, and D, but also how the transformations overlap and interact with the evolving system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
