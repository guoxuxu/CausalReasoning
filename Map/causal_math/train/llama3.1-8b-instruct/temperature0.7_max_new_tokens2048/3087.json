  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + au_x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(b\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) where \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), does the final form of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) depend exclusively on the original \\\\(a\\\\) rather than the modified \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(b\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new dynamic, affecting the evolution of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\). Thus, the final state at \\\\(T\\\\) will reflect the influence of both the original and modified constants, evidenced in a piecewise application of different exponential decay factors in the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
