  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent field described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax - By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's responses to transformations given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex scalar.\n\nCan we infer the original complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the exponential growth factor added by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could significantly modify the trajectory, obfuscating the original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
