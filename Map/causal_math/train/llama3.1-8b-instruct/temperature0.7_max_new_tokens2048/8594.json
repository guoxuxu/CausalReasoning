  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine that the original time-domain function was \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming standard conditions (e.g., no non-standard modifications in transform rules), the specific transform result \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-2)^2} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to \\\\( te^{2t} \\\\), allowing us to infer the original function correctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
