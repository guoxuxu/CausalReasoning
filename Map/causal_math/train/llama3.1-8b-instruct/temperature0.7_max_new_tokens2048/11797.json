  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) evolves according to the linear time-invariant system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) an input vector. We are interested in examining the effects of implementing an input transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represents a new transformed input.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(D v(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the input transformation, it is impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer \\\\(u(t)\\\\) from \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at T. The transformation by D could have altered the input in a non-identifiable way, especially if B and D are not easily invertible or distinguishable in their effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
