  "Problem": "Assuming a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. A Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it to a new domain.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can you accurately reconstruct the original time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowledge of whether any transformations were initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is inherently complicated by potential ambiguities in the Laplace inversion process, especially if the effect (being in the s-domain) causes alterations that are not reversible simply by knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
