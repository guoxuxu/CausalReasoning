  "Problem": "The system under study is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. The impact of an integral transformation represented by the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a kernel function, is analyzed.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\) alters the initial condition by introducing a distributed version based on the kernel function. As a result, this transforms initially localized effects or features of \\\\(u_0\\\\), leading to potentially different outcomes under the evolution of the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
