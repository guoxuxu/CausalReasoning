  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\) where \\( f(t) \\) is a time-dependent function and \\( s \\) is a complex variable. We analyze the causal influence of multiplying \\( f(t) \\) by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( F''(s) \\), can you determine whether the function \\( f(t) \\) was subject to multiplication by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) or \\( e^{-i\\theta t} \\) (or both) based on \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( F''(s) \\) of the intervened function may incorporate effects from both exponentials, and determining the sequence or specific interventions from \\( F''(s) \\) alone is ambiguous because the interactions between the transformations are not linear. This often results in composite effects that cannot be easily decomposed without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
