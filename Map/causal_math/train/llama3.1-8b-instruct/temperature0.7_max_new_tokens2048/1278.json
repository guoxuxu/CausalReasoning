  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C as 0, can we conclude with certainty that the contour does not enclose any singularity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is entire (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane) and has no singularities, any integral around a closed contour yielding zero implies that no branch points or additional structures influencing the integral were enclosed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
