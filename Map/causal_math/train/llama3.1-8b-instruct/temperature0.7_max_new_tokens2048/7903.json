  "Problem": "Assume we have a function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\). Also, suppose an integral transformation of this function using a contour in the complex plane specified as \\\\(T[f(z)] = \\\\int_C f(z) dz\\\\) where C is a semicircular contour from -R to R in the upper half-plane.\n\nIf we intentionally modify \\\\(f(z)\\\\) to \\\\(f(z) = e^{-z^2}\\\\) at a certain point in time during integration and continue the process over the same contour C, will the outcome of \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\) vary from the original scenario where \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) by changing its exponent from positive to negative (from \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) to \\\\(e^{-z^2}\\\\)) fundamentally alters the behavior of the function. This significant change not only impacts the convergence properties of the integral but also leads to a drastically different result in the integral transformation, reflecting a clear causal effect due to intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
