  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\(dz = Pz \\, dt\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. Investigate the implications of applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\) over time \\(t\\), with \\(Q\\) also being a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine accurately the interventions applied (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both) based solely on the knowledge of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions such as \\( g(z) \\) or \\( h(z) \\) solely from \\( z(T) \\) is problematic due to potential overlaps and non-uniqueness in matrix exponential effects. Identical or proximately similar endpoint states \\( z(T) \\) could result from disparate interventions, particularly with non-commutative properties of the matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
