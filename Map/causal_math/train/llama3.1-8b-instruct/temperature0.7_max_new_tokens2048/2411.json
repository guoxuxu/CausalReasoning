  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another rotation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the ending trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original dynamics and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another influencing factor, so the final trajectory \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), as well as the original dynamics. The combined effects of the rotations influence the ultimate position and orientation in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
