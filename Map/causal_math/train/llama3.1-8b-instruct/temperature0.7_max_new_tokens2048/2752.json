  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We apply a Laplace transform on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and explore how the transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), behaves under different initial conditions and interventions with additional transformations.\n\nCan we determine exactly the parameters of the interventions (values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) solely based on the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) resulting as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-c} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the initial forms or specific modifications, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) could yield the same functional transformation. Thus, other than the combined effect, individual parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are indistinct.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
