  "Problem": "Consider a system dynamics where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle in a one-dimensional space is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t) + F(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) a positive constant representing damping and \\\\( F(t) \\\\) an external force function. The study involves the introduction of a sudden force impulse \\\\( F(t) = I \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\), where \\\\( I \\\\) is the impulse magnitude and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nGiven the position of the particle at time \\\\( T \\\\) (after both impulses have acted), can we determine which impulse had a greater effect on the final position based solely on the observation at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the relative impact of each impulse based solely on the final position at \\\\( T \\\\) is complicated since the effects are cumulative and potentially nonlinear due to the dynamics introduced by each impulse. Without additional information on their timings and magnitudes, it's impossible to assess their individual contributions just from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
