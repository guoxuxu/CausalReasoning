  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across an element is described by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( V \\\\) as a constant voltage amplitude and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the angular frequency. The response of the circuit (current, \\\\( I(t) \\\\)) is given by a convolution involving the circuit's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the voltage function \\\\( V(t) \\\\) directly change the resulting current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) if no other component in the circuit is altered?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the convolution of \\\\( V(t) = Ve^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), any change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) alters the frequency components in \\\\( V(t) \\\\), which directly impacts the resulting current due to frequency-dependent behavior of the circuit's impedance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
