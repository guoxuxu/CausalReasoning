  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) \\) at \\( s = s_0 \\), is it possible to reconstruct the exact state \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without prior knowledge of whether the system was subjected to the Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "If \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) \\) is observed, using the inverse Laplace transform, one can determine \\( x(t) \\) quite accurately, irrespective of our knowledge about the usage of the Laplace transformation in the process, assuming the transformation was linear and reversible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
