  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) inside a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + g(x) \\\\) is applied globally within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is a known function, analyze the various causal influences.\n\nCan we infer the initial configuration of \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) from its subsequent state at time t without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) being applied, and since \\\\( g(x) \\\\) would not necessarily be zero, there is no deterministic way to retrieve the original \\\\( u \\\\) exactly from the modified state, as the addition of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) influences the system without leaving identifiable traces in the direction of solving Laplace's equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
