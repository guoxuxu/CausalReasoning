  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), representing a complex variable where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real numbers. We now explore the implications of the Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is allowed to evolve naturally following its own rules without any transformations applied at the onset, and then the Laplace transform is computed, will \\\\(F(s)\\\\) reflect solely the base properties of the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, being a linear operator, directly translates the properties of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) into the s-domain. Thus, without any intervention, \\\\(F(s)\\\\) precisely represents the inherent characteristics of the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
