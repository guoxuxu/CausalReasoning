  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation under the action of a linear operator defined by \\\\( L[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw \\), where the operation is along a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf at a certain point along the path, the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( g(z) = cz^2 \\\\) by multiplying with a complex number c, will the endpoint value \\\\( L[g](z) \\\\) depend only on the original transformation \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the intervention with c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with multiplying by c changes the function itself, thus directly impacting the integral computed by \\\\( L \\\\). Since \\\\( L \\\\) calculates the integral over the modified function \\\\( cz^2 \\\\) from 0 to z, the final value \\\\( L[g](z) \\\\) will be different and dependent on the value of c, reflecting the influence of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
