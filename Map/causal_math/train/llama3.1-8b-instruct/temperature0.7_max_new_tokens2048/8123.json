  "Problem": "Assume that we have a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a linear operator represented by a matrix. We consider the modification caused by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = N^t z \\\\), where N is also a matrix representation of a linear operator.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new function \\\\( i(z) = P^t z \\\\) (where P is another matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the system state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( i(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system, thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on M as well as the transformations N and P. The effects are cumulative and dependent on the interaction between these matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
