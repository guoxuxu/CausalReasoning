  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( T \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or knowledge about the original trajectory, it is impossible to definitely ascertain whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, as multiple transformations could result in similar trajectories depending on their parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
