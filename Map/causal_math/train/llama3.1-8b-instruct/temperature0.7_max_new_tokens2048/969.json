  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then observed evolving naturally under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), does applying \\\\( T \\\\) affect the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system, which in turn affects the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Since the complex logarithm depends directly on the argument of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by means of \\\\( T \\\\) alters the resulting path of \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
