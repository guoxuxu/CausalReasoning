  "Problem": "We consider the effects of the Laplace Transform on a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix, and study how this affects the system's response. We implement the transform \\\\(g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) and analyze its impact on the solution over the complex variable s.\n\nAfter observing the transformed output \\\\(g(z(t))(s)\\\\) at a particular s, can we reconstruct the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the Laplace Transform, the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) cannot be precisely reconstructed. Since the transformation to the s-domain alters the information content by integrating exponential components, retrieval of the precise initial condition from the transformed data alone is generally indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
