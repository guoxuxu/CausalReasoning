  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) represents the Laplacian operator. We are interested in the effect of applyingt the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\), which transforms the function into the Fourier space, on the causal inference in the system.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve as per the transformed PDE in Fourier space, will the function in the physical space, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to its evolution via the original PDE without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is an invertible linear operation that simply changes the basis without affecting the system's inherent dynamics governed by the PDE. Thus, the evolution in the Fourier space precisely represents the physical phenomena in the original space over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
