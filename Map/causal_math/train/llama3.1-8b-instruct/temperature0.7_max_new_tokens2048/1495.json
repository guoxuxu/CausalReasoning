  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) represents a transformation over time t, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( Q \\\\), since the evolution of the system has been influenced by both initial and subsequent transformations. The overall state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on the combined effects of these transformations, involving composite matrix exponentials.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
