  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real number and represents angular frequency. The function is initially subjected to the linear operator \\\\( L \\{ z(t) \\} = \\\\int_{0}^{∞} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{iω't + φ} \\\\) at a particular time t=0, will the Laplace transform solely reflect the initial frequency \\\\( ω \\\\) without influence from the new frequency \\\\( ω' \\\\) or phase shift \\\\( φ \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{iω't + φ} \\\\), and the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( L \\{ z'(t) \\} = e^{φ} / (s - iω') \\\\). Therefore, the resulting expression will reflect the intervened frequency \\\\( ω' \\\\) and include the phase shift \\\\( φ \\\\), affecting the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
