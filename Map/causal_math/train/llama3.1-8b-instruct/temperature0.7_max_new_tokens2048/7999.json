  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant denoting angular frequency. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iws}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), altering the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be determined uniquely by \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without considering \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the addition of \\\\( c \\\\) fundamentally changes the trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a function not only of \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) but also of \\\\( c \\\\). This alters both the amplitude and phase, impacting the superposition and resulting state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
