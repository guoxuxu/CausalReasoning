  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a time-dependent variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) denoted as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Now assume the introduction of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), which alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = x(t)f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we recover the exact form of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at any time t, without knowing a priori that the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Not knowing that \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was applied obscures the true nature of the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Without this knowledge, it’s impossible to determine whether the shift in the Laplace domain is intrinsic to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or a result of the multiplication by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), thereby precluding precise recovery of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
