  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 v = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). Assess the effect of the boundary condition alteration defined through \\\\( v' = v + h \\\\) on the boundary \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a known function defined on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point along the boundary \\\\(\\\\Gamma_1 \\\\subset \\\\Gamma\\\\), an additional alteration \\\\(v'' = v' + g\\\\) is imposed where \\\\(g\\\\) is another boundary function, is the final solution in \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) dependent only on the last set boundary condition \\\\(v''\\\\) disregarding previous conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(v''(x)\\\\) within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) will conform to the latest boundary conditions. Due to the nature of Laplace's equation and boundary conditions fundamentally dictating the solution, the most recent boundary influences override earlier ones in entirety.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
