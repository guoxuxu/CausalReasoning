  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex variable \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Möbius transformation changes the initial conditions of the system. The new trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) will follow a different path under the dynamics specified by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), leading to a different end state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
