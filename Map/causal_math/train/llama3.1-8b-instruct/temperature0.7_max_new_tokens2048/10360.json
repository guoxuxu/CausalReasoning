  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\). A transformation is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations or sequences of transformations involving \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), as well as the unmodified trajectory. Overlapping effects of the transformations and the underlying system dynamics obscure the specific contributions of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), precluding exact identification of the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
