  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A+B)s}z(s) ds \\\\) on z over the time interval [0, T].\n\nGiven the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory of z from its initial conditions through a convolution of effects involving matrices A and B, it is not possible to clearly deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without specific information about the application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
