  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, and the effect of a Fourier transform on functions within this space. Specifically, examine the case where \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), and the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( f \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nIf a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) to get \\\\( Lf \\\\), and then Fourier transformed, will the result \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\) be the same as directly applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then multiplying by \\\\( -ik \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\) leads directly to the property that the Fourier transform of the derivative (via integration by parts assuming \\\\( f \\\\) vanishes at infinity) is \\\\( ik \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\). Since \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), its Fourier transform becomes \\\\( -ik \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\), which is precisely applying the Fourier transform first and then multiplying by \\\\( -ik \\\\).",
