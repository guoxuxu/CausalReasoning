  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by adding a constant real value \\\\( a \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve naturally, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be equivalent to adding \\\\( a \\\\delta(\\omega) \\\\) to the original \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) translates to adding a \\\\( a \\\\cdot \\delta(\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, due to the Fourier transform properties. This perturbation translates linearly through the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "adding a constant to z(t) → z(t) changes; z(t) changes → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → \\hat{z}(\\omega); adding a constant to z(t) at t = 0 → change in \\hat{z}(\\omega); change in \\hat{z}(\\omega) → \\hat{z}(\\omega) changes; \\hat{z}(\\omega) changes → \\hat{z}(\\omega) + a\\delta(\\omega)"
