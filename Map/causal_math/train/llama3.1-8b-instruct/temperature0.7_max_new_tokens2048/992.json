  "Problem": "Examine the implications of the integral transformation \\\\( I[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\,dt \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, when a multiplier transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^m \\\\) is also applied either before or after \\\\( I[f] \\\\), with \\\\( m \\\\) also being a positive integer.\n\nCan we explicitly determine the sequence and types of multipliers applied (\\\\( t^m \\\\) and/or \\\\( t^p \\\\), and their order) after observing the final result of the processing and knowing the initial function was \\\\( t^n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed result could stem from various sequences of applying \\\\( t^m \\\\), \\\\( t^p \\\\), and the integral operation, without a unique inversion. Different combinations of multipliers and their order can yield equivalent end results, making specific sequence and type determination ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
