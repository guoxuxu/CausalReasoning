  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing an oscillatory system. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is calculated for a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) without any additional functional transformation, does this process alter the resulting frequency domain representation compared to if the system was directly evolved under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), precisely reflecting the frequency of oscillation dictated by the differential equation. Thus, there is no alteration in the frequency domain characteristics directly due to the transformation by \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The constant ω causes the oscillation of the system, which in turn affects the resulting frequency domain representation of the function F(z)."
