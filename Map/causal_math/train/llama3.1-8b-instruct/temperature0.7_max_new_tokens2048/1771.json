  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We assess how the behavior of the system changes if a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), with M a constant matrix, is applied at different moments.\n\nIf an intervention employing another function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is effected at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend uniquely on D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "Both the interventions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) influence the evolution of the system, impacting the state at time T through distinct transformations. Therefore, the state at T is dependent on M, N, and D, as the final state reflects cumulative effects of these matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
