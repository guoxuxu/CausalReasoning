  "Problem": "Consider an engineering structure subject to a loading and unloading sequence. Its response is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k u = f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is the displacement, \\\\( c \\\\) is the damping coefficient, \\\\( k \\\\) is the stiffness, and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the external force applied to the system. We analyze the model's behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) u \\\\) over time, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the displacement \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we unravel whether the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\) influenced the initial conditions at t = 0, without additional information about the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The complex nature of the dynamical system's response, coupled with damping and stiffness terms, means that even knowing \\\\( u(T) \\\\), we cannot definitively state whether the initial condition was altered by the transformation \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) u \\\\). Multiple potential inputs or transformations could yield the same output due to the system's sensitivity to initial conditions and parameter settings.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
