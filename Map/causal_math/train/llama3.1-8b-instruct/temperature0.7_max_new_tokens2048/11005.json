  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\), which evolves differently under the given differential equation compared to the unmodified \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The factor \\\\( e^{kT} \\\\) introduces an exponential growth or decay and phase shift dependent on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(k\\\\), respectively, leading to a different outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
