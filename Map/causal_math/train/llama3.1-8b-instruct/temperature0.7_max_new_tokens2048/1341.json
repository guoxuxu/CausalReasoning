  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\) is initially applied and then the Fourier Transform is taken without further intervention, does the resulting \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{g(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) equal the first derivative \\\\( -i\\\\frac{d}{dk}\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\), assuming f(x) is sufficiently smooth and well-behaved?",
  "Explanation": "By the differentiation property of the Fourier transform, multiplying the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by \\\\( x \\\\) in the time domain corresponds to taking the derivative \\\\( -i\\\\frac{d}{dk} \\\\) in the frequency domain. Thus, the transform of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) corresponds to \\\\( -i\\\\frac{d}{dk}\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
