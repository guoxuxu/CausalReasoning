  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = K(t)x \\\\) over time t, where K(t) is a time-dependent matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without any further inputs or disturbances, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the case where \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was simply evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at the initial stage modifies the starting conditions, thus altering the system trajectory. The effect of K(t) at initial time influences how the state evolves under D, leading to a different state at time T compared to the unaltered scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
