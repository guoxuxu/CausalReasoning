  "Problem": "Imagine a system involving heat transfer on a rod modelled by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\), where \\( u \\) represents the temperature, \\( t \\) is the time, and \\( x \\) the position along the rod. The transformation \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + h(t)e^{ax} \\) is considered, where \\( h(t) \\) is a specific heat source function and \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a further transformation \\( v(x, t) \\gets v(x, t) + s(t)e^{bx} \\) (where \\( s(t) \\) is another heat source function and \\( b \\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the system's state at \\( t = T \\) (for \\( T > t_1 \\)) depend solely on \\( k \\) and not on \\( a \\) or \\( b \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's final state at \\( T \\) involves influences from the original heat conduction constant \\( k \\), and also from the parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) introduced through transformations. The state \\( v(x, T) \\) will reflect the cumulative effects of initial conditions modified by \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) and further altered by \\( s(t)e^{bx} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
