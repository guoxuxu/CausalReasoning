  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a linear time-invariant differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) operating on a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and consider the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\). Assume \\\\( L[u(t)] = -u''(t) + 3u'(t) - 2u(t) \\\\), and study the Laplace transform effects.\n\nKnowing the transformed result \\\\( T[u'(t)] \\\\) after intervention, can we determine the specific form of the intervention \\\\( v(t) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed result \\\\( T[u'(t)] \\\\) integrates all modifications into a solitary expression, losing information about the specificities of individual components like \\\\( v(t) \\\\), especially if \\\\( v(t) \\\\)'s influence manifests similarly to any natural part of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) under the transformation. Identifying \\\\( v(t) \\\\) uniquely is, therefore, not feasible solely based on \\\\( T[u'(t)] \\\\) without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
