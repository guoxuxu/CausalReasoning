  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\xi x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for a later time T follow the same evolution as predicted by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the heat equation leads to a simpler expression in the frequency domain where the system evolves as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k \\\\xi^2 \\\\hat{u} \\\\). The evolution in the frequency domain is consistent with the heat equation, merely transformed into this new representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
