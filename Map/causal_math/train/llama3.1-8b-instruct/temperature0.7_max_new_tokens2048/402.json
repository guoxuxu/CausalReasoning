  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's behavior is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Kx}u \\\\), where K is a constant matrix and x represents spatial coordinates.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0 be inferred precisely after observing \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at x = X and t = T without knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied, any transformation linked to \\\\( e^{Kx} \\\\) complicates tracing back the original form of \\\\( u_0 \\\\). The additional modification by K distorts the direct lineage from the observed state back to the initial condition, hence the original function cannot be determined unambiguously.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
