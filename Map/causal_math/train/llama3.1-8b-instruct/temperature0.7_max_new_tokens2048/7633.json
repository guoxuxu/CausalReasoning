  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) initially and after an intervention defined by multiplying by a modifier function \\\\(m(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) is obtained by applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear and invertible operation, preserving the dynamics under linear differential operators. Thus, transforming the initial condition and evolving or evolving the initial condition and then transforming will yield consistent results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
