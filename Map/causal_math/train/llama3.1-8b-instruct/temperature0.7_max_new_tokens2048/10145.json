  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) follow the differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the trajectory of z over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system defined by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), changing the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) due to the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). This transformation can affect the system differently based on how C interacts with A and B, leading to a distinct state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
