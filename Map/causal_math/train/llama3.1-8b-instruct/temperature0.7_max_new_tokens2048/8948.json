  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a complex constant vector. This scenario investigates the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{iBt}w \\\\) where B is also a real constant, and how it modifies the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\), \\\\( k(w) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from different combinations of interventions due to the additive nature of the phases induced by B and C conjunction with A. Since multiple scenarios of B and C could yield the same endpoint phase and magnitude, it's impossible to uniquely deduce which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
