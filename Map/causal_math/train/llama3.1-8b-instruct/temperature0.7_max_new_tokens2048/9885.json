  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) is applied to a variable \\\\( w_0 \\\\) in the contour \\\\( C \\\\) and then \\\\( C \\\\) is evolved under \\\\( z(w) \\\\) without further intervention, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\) changes the nature of the contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane, which alters the values of \\\\( w \\\\) along \\\\( C \\\\). Since \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\) depends explicitly on \\\\( w \\\\), the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) will indeed be different as the function values \\\\( z(w) \\\\) are transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
