  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) and knowing the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we uniquely determine the phase shifts \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) that were applied at t = 0 and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) respectively?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed result \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) could correspond to different combinations of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the function and the complex interaction between multiple phase shifts. Multiple scenarios may yield the same observation at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
