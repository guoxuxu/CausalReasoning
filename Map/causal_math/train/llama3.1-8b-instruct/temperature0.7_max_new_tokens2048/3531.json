  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the role of the integral transform \\\\( H(u) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sL}u(s) ds \\\\) applied to the function u over time t.\n\nIf a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) as an intervention, modifying the system to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Mu\\\\) for t > t_1, will the behavior of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) now solely be dictated by M, completely independent of whether \\\\( H(u) \\\\) was initially calculated?",
  "Explanation": "The initial computation of \\\\( H(u) \\\\) could have modified the system state before \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and a combination of the influences of L and M post-intervention still shapes the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\). Both the initial condition affected by \\\\( H(u) \\\\) and the subsequent application of M contribute to the ultimate configuration at \\\\( T \\\\), indicating dependency on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
