  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) within the context of complex functions, where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. The operation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, defines an integral transformation on z(t).\n\nIf an intervention occurs where a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another matrix) is applied at some intermediate time t = t_1, does the resulting \\\\( H(z) \\\\) for T > t_1 reflect only the influence of matrix A and not C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from t_1, contributing the effects of both C and A to the evolution of the function. This changed trajectory influences the outcome of \\\\( H(z) \\\\), reflecting impacts from A and C.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix C influences H(z) only if T > t1, as the integral transformation H(z) reflects the influence of all matrices A, B, and C up to time t1."
