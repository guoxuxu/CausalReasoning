  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function at time T, is it possible to exactly reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time 0 without additional information about the kernel used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the phase and frequency characteristics of the original signal in a way that may not be invertible, especially without precise information about the kernel \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\). The loss of certain frequency components due to the convolution with a Gaussian kernel makes it impossible to uniquely identify the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
