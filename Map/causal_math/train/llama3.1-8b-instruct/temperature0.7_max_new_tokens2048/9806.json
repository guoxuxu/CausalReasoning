  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex-valued differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau}z d\\\\tau \\\\) over time t, where B is a real constant matrix that generally does not commute with A.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), can we infer the exact original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the state at t = T without information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) means that the original condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might have been modified initially by the transformation, which potentially cannot be undone or inferred accurately due to the non-commutativity of exponentials of B and A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
