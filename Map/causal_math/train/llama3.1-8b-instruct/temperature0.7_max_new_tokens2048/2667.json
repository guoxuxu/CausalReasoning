  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\), where k is a positive constant. The system undergoes an analysis involving a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies the system to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -(k+m)z \\\\) (where m is an additional decay rate), will the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the decay rate of the system, which significantly alters the spectral characteristics of the system at time T. The frequency response calculated through the Fourier transform is directly dependent on the total decay rate \\\\( k+m \\\\), hence it varies with m.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
