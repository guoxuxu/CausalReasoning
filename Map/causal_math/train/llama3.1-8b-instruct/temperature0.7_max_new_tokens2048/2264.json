  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nKnowing only the resulting function at time T, can we determine whether transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( g \\\\) or both were applied during the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at time T is influenced by both transformations in ways that are not easy to disentangle due to their respective integral impacts on the original function. Thus, the exact influence of each transformation, whether individually or in combination, cannot be ascertained without additional context or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
