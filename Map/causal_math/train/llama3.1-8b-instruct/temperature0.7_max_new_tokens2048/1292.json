  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. This function is used in transformations of signals in a system described by the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} h(t)z(t) dt \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being the system's impulse response.\n\nGiven the final output of the system at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to exactly determine the interventions used (\\\\( p(t) \\\\) applied or not) merely by analyzing the output characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution and possible similar effects of various intervention strategies (like different forms of \\\\( p(t) \\\\)), it is generally not possible to uniquely backtrack and determine the exact nature or presence of interventions based solely on output observation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
