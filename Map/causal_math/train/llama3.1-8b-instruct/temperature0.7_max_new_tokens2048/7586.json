  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable z, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The question examines the sensitivity of the integral transformation under varying parameters.\n\nGiven the function output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at a new parameter value \\\\( s+\\\\delta \\\\), can we deduce the function output at the original parameter s, without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the shift in parameter or its magnitude, it is impossible to uniquely trace back to the function output at the original parameter s. The effects of varying s on the integral are irreversible solely from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
