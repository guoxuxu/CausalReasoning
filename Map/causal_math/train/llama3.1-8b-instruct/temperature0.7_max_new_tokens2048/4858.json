  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by a partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Pz = 0 \\), where \\( P \\) is a differential operator. Consider applying an integral transform \\( H \\) as defined by \\( z(t) \\mapsto \\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\) for complex \\( s \\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing its transform \\( z(s) \\) for all \\( s \\) in the complex plane without knowing whether the differential equation was accurately followed throughout the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge of the adherence to the differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Pz = 0 \\) during the evolution, errors or deviations could result in a transformed function \\( z(s) \\) that does not accurately reflect the original state \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
