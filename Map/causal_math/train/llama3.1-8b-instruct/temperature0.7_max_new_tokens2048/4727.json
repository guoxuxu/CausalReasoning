  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We are examining how the Laplace transform, which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} \\\\) with complex s, affects our causal understanding of this system.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention transforms the system to \\\\( z(t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\\\) followed by natural progression, will the real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be different from \\\\( \\\\cos(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z(t_1) \\\\) to a decay factor which changes the natural progression. After the intervention, the function continues to evolve not as \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) but with a modified initial condition, therefore the real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not follow the initial cosine trajectory and will differ from \\\\( \\\\cos(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
