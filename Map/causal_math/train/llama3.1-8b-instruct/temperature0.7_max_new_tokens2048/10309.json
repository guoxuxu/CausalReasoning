  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, represented by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nAssuming the initial condition of \\\\( w \\\\) is set to a specific value \\\\( w_0 \\\\) and evolves purely under the transformation \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a given \\\\( s \\\\) represent the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is defined as an integral transform of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) with a kernel resembling the Fourier transform's kernel, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) indeed represents the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(w) \\\\). The transformation effectively computes how \\\\( z(w) \\\\) behaves in the frequency domain characterized by \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
