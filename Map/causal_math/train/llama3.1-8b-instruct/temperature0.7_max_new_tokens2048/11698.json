  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nBased on the output of the integral transformation \\\\( G(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to deduce whether the initial complex number faced any rotational transformation by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) compiles all evolutionary changes over the entire range and effectively aggregates the impact of the rotational transformations throughout the period. Without additional phase tracking or information about initial phase conditions, one cannot distinguish if the original complex number was subjected to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) just by observing \\\\( G(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
