  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) on the function u(t).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at s = a, is it possible to determine explicitly which operator, L or L', acted on the system at a specific past time interval?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function in the s-domain, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\), encapsulates the cumulative effects over all time intervals influenced by both operators L and L'. Due to this cumulative nature and integral transform’s non-invertibility specific to boundary conditions and exact operating intervals, it does not allow backtracking to specific operators at certain times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
