  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex parameter \\\\( w_0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform equation, will the outcome \\\\( F(z(w_0)) \\\\) at any later stage solely be a rotated version of \\\\( F(w_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the rotated parameter \\\\( w_0 \\\\) will be a rotated version of \\\\( F(w_0) \\\\) due to the linear and shift-invariant properties of the Fourier transform under rotational transformations in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
