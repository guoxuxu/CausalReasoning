  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We are also interested in the effect of a transformation represented by the operator \\\\( P(t) = e^{Mt} \\\\), with M being another constant operator. This transformation is applied to the initial condition prior to evolution under the system's dynamics.\n\nIf a new operator \\\\( Q(t) = e^{Nt} \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, be independent of M, depending only on L and N?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention with \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) will still involve the effects of M initiated at t=0, combined with the impacts of N post t_1. Consequently, the state at time T depends on M, L, and N, reflecting compositional influences from these operators.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
