  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nWith knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) solely based on the end state value?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the endpoint state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated due to potential overlaps in the effects caused by transformations \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Gt} \\\\). The state at T could potentially originate from various combinations or sequences of these transformations, especially if the matrices F and G do not commute, thus obfuscating clear causal tracing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
