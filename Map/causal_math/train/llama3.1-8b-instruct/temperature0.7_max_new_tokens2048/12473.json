  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) representing a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\), and how it maps the function into a complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\) at some time, can we infer the original signal \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The original signal’s frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is essential for reconstructing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace transform. Without knowing \\\\( \\omega \\\\), multiple frequencies could yield similar transforms, obscuring the exact original sinusoidal signal.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
