  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applies a phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) leading to \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)}\\\\) prior to the Fourier transform, will the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the transformed domain still be unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a phase shift, while altering the time domain presentation of the signal, does not affect the frequency component under the Fourier transform. The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains preserved, with the transform only modifying the complex phase in the frequency domain, not the location or the presence of the frequency component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
