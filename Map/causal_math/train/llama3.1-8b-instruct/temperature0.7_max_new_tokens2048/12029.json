  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform output as a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), can we conclude that the original function was \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the Fourier Transform explicitly indicates that the input was an oscillatory function at that specific frequency, directly pointing to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) as the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier Transform → delta function at ω; z(t) = e^(iωt) → Fourier Transform; ω → z(t) = e^(iωt)"
