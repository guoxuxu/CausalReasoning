  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) \\\\), which changes the domain from time-space to frequency-time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether initial Fourier transform, inverse Fourier transform at t_1, or both), solely by knowing the state at time T in the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can be achieved through various configurations and interventions (including multiple applications of Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms at different times). The linearity and reversibility of these transformations mean that multiple paths could lead to the same final state, making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific series and types of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
