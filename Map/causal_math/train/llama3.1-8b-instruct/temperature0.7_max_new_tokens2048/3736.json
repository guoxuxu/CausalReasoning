  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = My + Nu \\), with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) as the control input. An operator \\( T(y) = e^{Ky} \\) is introduced, where \\( K \\) is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven \\( y(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions (specifically the control inputs and transformations like \\( T(y) \\)) were applied throughout \\( [0, T] \\), based solely on the endpoint \\( y(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of the control inputs \\( u(t) \\) and the transformation \\( T(y) \\), multiple combinations of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( K \\) could lead to the same endpoint \\( y(T) \\), making it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
