  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(X) \\\\), we cannot know if the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) was involved, which could significantly alter the mean and variance paths of the stochastic process. This uncertainty prevents accurate back-calculation of \\\\( X_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
