  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\). We analyze the behavior of its integral transformation using the Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the exact original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) purely from its Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) at a fixed value of s, specifically s = 2?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform is a transformation that compresses function information into a different domain, recovering the exact original function from a single value of its transform (at s = 2) is generally not possible. Additional constraints or information would be needed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
