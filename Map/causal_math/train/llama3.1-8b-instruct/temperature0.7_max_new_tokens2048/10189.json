  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nIf the population \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is set at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\) without any intervention, will the population at time t = T be equal to \\\\( y_0 e^{rT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of intervention, the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\) with the initial condition \\\\( y(0) = y_0 \\\\) yields \\\\( y(t) = y_0 e^{rT} \\\\). Hence, the population grows exponentially without deviations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
