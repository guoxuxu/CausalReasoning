  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze the effect of an initial condition transformed by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the precise interventions used (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) by observing only the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could be achievable through various combinations and timings of applications of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x) \\\\). The non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials and their influence on the trajectory create ambiguity in reverse-engineering the interventions solely from the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
