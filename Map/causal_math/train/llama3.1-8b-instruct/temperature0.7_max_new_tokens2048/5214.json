  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a step function. We apply the Laplace transform to this signal and analyze various influence scenarios within the Laplace transform space.\n\nUpon observing the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\\\), can we conclusively determine that the original function was \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\) without any prior information about the presence of \\\\(u(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is integral to determining the structure of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) but the transform alone \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\\\) could similarly result from other functions like \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) for \\\\(t > 0\\\\) without explicitly involving the step function. Additional context about the function is necessary.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
