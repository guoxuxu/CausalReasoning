  "Problem": "Examine the effects of a complex function transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\(t\\\\) is time. This scenario includes the subsequent application of Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on a complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nBased on the output from a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(z'(t))\\\\}\\\\) post-intervention, can we reliably infer which interventions occurred, specifically whether \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) or \\\\(z'(t) = e^{-t}\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform after interventions could result from various combinations and interactions between the initial condition and subsequent interventions, such as different constants or types of transformations applied at different times. Therefore, without explicit temporal data or additional constraints on the system, specific interventions cannot be reliably inferred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → output; z(t) = e^{it} → Laplace transform; z'(t) = e^{-t} → Laplace transform; t → z(t); z(t) → Laplace transform{f(z(t))}; t → z'(t); z'(t) → Laplace transform{f(z'(t))"
