  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dz}{dt} + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this function over time.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\), where \\\\( Dz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + rz \\\\) (\\\\( r \\\\) being a constant), is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( L \\\\) and not \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( r \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( D \\\\) modifies the dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and therefore alters the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The alteration introduced by \\\\( D \\\\) and the parameter \\\\( r \\\\) will influence the transformed function indicating dependence on both \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
