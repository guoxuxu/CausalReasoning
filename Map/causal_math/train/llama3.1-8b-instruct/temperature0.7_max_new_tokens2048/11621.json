  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number and f(z) is a complex function of the variable z. We analyze how this transformation and an additional operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D}(g(z)) = \\\\frac{d}{dz}g(z) \\\\) affect the evolved function over time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z)) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{zt} \\\\) without further transformation, will the result at s = z be the same as if \\\\( f(t) = e^{zt} \\\\) was integrated directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t) = e^{zt}) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-z} \\\\). Without further transformations, evaluating at s = z should theoretically give an infinite result, aligning with the direct integration of an exponential function which also tends towards infinity or undefined at its pole.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
