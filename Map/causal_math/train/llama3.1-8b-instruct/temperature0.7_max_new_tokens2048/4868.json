  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform output, can we determine specifically which rotations (either \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i\\\\phi} \\\\), or both) were applied to the initial complex number?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant Fourier transform output could potentially be a consequence of different combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) owing to the rotational symmetry. Different sets of rotations might result in the same final transformed output, rendering it ambiguous to infer the exact sequence or type of rotations applied without more detailed information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
