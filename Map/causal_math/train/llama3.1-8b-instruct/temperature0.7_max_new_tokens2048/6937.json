  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially without further transformation, does this affect the time-domain representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is altered fundamentally?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is a linear and reversible operation affecting only the frequency domain representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The time-domain behavior of the system, described by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), remains dictated by the differential equations without alteration by the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
