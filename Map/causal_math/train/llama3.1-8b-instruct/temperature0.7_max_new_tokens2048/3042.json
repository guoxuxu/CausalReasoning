  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nFrom measurement of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially, can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with certainty?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is unknown, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could either be \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{kT}e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\) and without further information, the phase factor introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) obscures the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is therefore not possible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
