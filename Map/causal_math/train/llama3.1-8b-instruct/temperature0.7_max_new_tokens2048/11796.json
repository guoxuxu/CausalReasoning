  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) evolves according to the linear time-invariant system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) an input vector. We are interested in examining the effects of implementing an input transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represents a new transformed input.\n\nIf the input transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\) is applied at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if the original input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) without transformation was applied directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\) modifies the input signal, thereby altering the system's response according to the system dynamics. The new input affects how the state trajectory evolves from its initial condition, producing a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
