  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number and \\( t \\) is time. This function represents a point moving in a circle on the complex plane. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\), on this function over the frequency domain \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) in the form of a delta function at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\), can we reconstruct \\( z(t) \\) as \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without knowing the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "Because the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is unique and invertible, observing a delta function at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\) allows us to uniquely identify the original function as \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). This invasion-back property of Fourier transforms ensures the ability to reconstruct the time-domain function from its frequency domain image.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
