  "Problem": "Consider a spatial domain in which the temperature distribution is represented by the complex function \\\\(T(z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is time. The initial temperature distribution is given by \\\\(T(z,0) = z^2\\\\). The transformation under consideration is a Laplace transformation applied over time and its inverse applied at a later time \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nKnowing the resultant state \\\\(T(z,T)\\\\), can we determine the specific transformations used (original application of Laplace and inverse Laplace, and the additional transformation at \\\\(t_1\\\\)) strictly from observing \\\\(T(z,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\(T(z,T)\\\\) at any given \\\\(T\\\\) could potentially result from various transformations and manipulations applied during the interval. The problem of discerning precisely what transformations were invoked is worsened by potential non-linear effects and the overlapping of modifications induced by each transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
