  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = pz + q\\\\), where p and q are complex constants. Examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s)ds\\\\) applied over time t, with s being a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at some later time T be the same as if \\\\(z(t)\\\\) was directly evolved to time T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = pz + q\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) fundamentally alters the initial conditions of the system through integration, potentially modifying the system's trajectory over time. The evolution of this altered initial state under the original differential equation will not result in the same state at time T compared to evolution from the unmodified initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the integral transformation T(z) to z(t) and then evolving it under the differential equation dz/dt = pz + q will yield the same result as directly evolving z(t) to time T under the differential equation if and only if s is a solution to the equation (p - s) * e^(s*t) - 1 = 0."
