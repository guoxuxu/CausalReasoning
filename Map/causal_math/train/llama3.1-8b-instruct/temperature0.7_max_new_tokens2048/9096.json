  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\) with A and B as constant matrices. We further examine the transformation dictated by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied on z(t), producing \\\\(Z(s)\\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\(Z(T) = U(T) + iV(T)\\\\), can we determine which transformation matrix was applied at t1 (whether it was A, B, or D), assuming that one was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of \\\\(Z(T)\\\\) provides limited information on interventions due to potential equivalences in state trajectories arising from different transformation matrices. Without additional constraints or data, discerning which specific matrix influenced the trajectory is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
