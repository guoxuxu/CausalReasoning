  "Problem": "Investigate a system where current flows through an electrical circuit influenced by a complex function transform. The current \\( I(t) \\) is governed by \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\) where \\( R \\) is resistance and \\( V_0 \\) a voltage source. We explore the behavior under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) and its inverse.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) is applied initially and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( I(t) \\) at any subsequent time \\( t \\) be the same if the transform was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a reversible linear operation affecting only the expression but not the actual physical system behavior. Application and reversal of the Laplace Transform to \\( I(t) \\) do not alter the underlying dynamics described by \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
