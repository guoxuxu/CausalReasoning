  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a Hermitian matrix and i is the imaginary unit, defining oscillatory dynamics. We explore the consequences of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another skew-Hermitian matrix, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the system’s trajectory, affecting both phase and amplitude. The state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the historical effects of B, ongoing effects of A, and the intervention by C. This intervention alters the pathway and results in a state that reflects the mixture of these influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
