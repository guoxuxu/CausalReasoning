  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the action of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to deduce the precise initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), determining the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or presence of transformation is impossible due to ambiguity in scaling effects; both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are altered by \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
