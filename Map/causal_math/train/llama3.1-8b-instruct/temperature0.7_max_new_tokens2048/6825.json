  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. To analyze this scenario, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any alterations to the function or parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under its original differential equation, will the transformation impact the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is an integral transform that does not affect the function's on-going evolution, it does not alter the time-dependent behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation merely provides a representation at the time of application and does not interact with the differential trajectory of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
