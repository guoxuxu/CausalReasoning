  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) through different linear transformations \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane, and we consider the effect of transformations on this motion.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and the system is then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t = T be a simple rotation by \\\\( \\omega T \\\\) radians?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies both the magnitude and position of the initial complex value, affecting the trajectory. Hence, the resultant path will not only involve rotation but also scaling and translation, altering the simple rotational dynamics described by \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
