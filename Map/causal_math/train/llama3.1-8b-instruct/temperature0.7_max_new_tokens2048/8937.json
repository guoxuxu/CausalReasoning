  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0 \\\\) where a is a constant. Let's explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t)) \\\\) on this equation over time.\n\nIf initially \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, 0) \\\\), and then evolves according to the transformed partial differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) reflect the same solution at time T as if the original \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved to time T under the original partial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts the spatial derivative into a multiplicative term in the frequency domain, transforming the problem into \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_{t} + ia\\\\xi \\\\hat{u} = 0 \\\\). This maintains the link between the transformations of solutions in time. Therefore, evolution in the transform domain corresponds directly to evolution in the original domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
