  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without further manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly integrating t^2 + i \\\\cdot t from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) directly evaluates the integral of the input function from 0 to t, so applying it to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) simply results in the integral of t^2 + i \\\\cdot t up to time T. Thus, it will directly equate to \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
