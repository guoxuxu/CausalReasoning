  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system where the stock price follows a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is the drift rate, \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) the volatility, and \\\\( dW \\\\) a Brownian motion increment. We apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) to transform the probability density function of the stock price.\n\nKnowing the characteristic function at t = T, can we identify whether the operation \\\\( e^\\\\{-\\\\lambda^2 t\\\\} \\\\) was applied at some time t1, solely from the data at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting characteristic function at T could be influenced by several factors, including the initial conditions, natural stochastic dynamics, or other transformations applied during its evolution. Distinguishing the effects solely caused by the \\\\( e^\\\\{-\\\\lambda^2 t\\\\} \\\\) without additional context or data prior to T is impractical, as multiple scenarios could lead to similar characteristic functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "drift rate → stock price; volatility → stock price; Brownian motion increment → stock price; Fourier transform → characteristic function; stock price → characteristic function; characteristic function → operation at t1; operation at t1 → characteristic function at t = T; characteristic function at t = T → operation at t1"
