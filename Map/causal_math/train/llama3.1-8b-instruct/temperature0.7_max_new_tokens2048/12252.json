  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyze how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nIf an initial Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting transform at any later time \\\\( T \\\\) remain the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) had been transformed after evolving for time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The dynamics introduced by \\\\( i \\\\omega z + k \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus changing its subsequent Laplace transform. The addition of \\\\( k \\\\) introduces a non-homogeneity, affecting the evolution even under the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
