  "Problem": "Evaluate the implication of the Laplace transform on the behavior of an electrical circuit described by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is inductance, \\( R \\) is resistance, and \\( V(t) \\) represents a time-varying voltage source. The transformation applied is \\( \\mathcal{L}(I(t)) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(V(t))}{sL + R} \\), and we analyze effects and causality with respect to this transform.\n\nBy observing the current \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we exactly determine \\( V(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) without prior knowledge of the behavior of \\( V(t) \\) during the interval \\( 0 \\) to \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without full interval data of \\( V(t) \\) or additional information about its form, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( I(t) \\) does not necessarily yield a unique \\( V(t) \\), as the transformation might lose specificity of the input conditions due to potential non-injective mappings.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
