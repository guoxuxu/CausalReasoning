  "Problem": "We consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) with complex variable s is applied.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing the value of s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) involves an integration which essentially 'smooths out' or aggregates the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, influenced by the exponential weight of \\\\( -st \\\\). Without knowing the parameter s, it's impossible to reverse this aggregation uniquely due to the loss of phase information and the exponential weighting.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
