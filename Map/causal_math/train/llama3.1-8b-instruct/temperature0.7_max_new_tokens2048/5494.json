  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential V(x), described by \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = [-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 + V(x)]\\\\psi \\\\). We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) at time t and analyzing its momentum space representation.\n\nGiven the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) in momentum space at t = T, is it possible to determine if \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) was first Fourier transformed or if the system was evolved in position space and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution under the Schrödinger equation, whether in position or momentum space, fundamentally changes the wave function due to non-commuting operators involved in the evolution. Knowing \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) alone does not reveal the specific order of transformation and evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → wave function in momentum space; V(x) → potential energy; potential energy → Hamiltonian; Hamiltonian → time evolution; time evolution → wave function at time t; wave function at time t → Fourier transform; wave function in momentum space → analysis; analysis → determination of transformation history"
