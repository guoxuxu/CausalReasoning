  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function, transforming it into \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\(s_1\\\\) an intervention modifies the Laplace transformed function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) explicitly to a new function based on an arbitrary matrix N, will the final state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend only on N and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at \\\\(s_1\\\\), but the eventual inversion back to the time-domain function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(T\\\\) depends on both N and the original system matrix M, as the dynamics governed by M up until \\\\(s_1\\\\) and the changes introduced by N both influence the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
