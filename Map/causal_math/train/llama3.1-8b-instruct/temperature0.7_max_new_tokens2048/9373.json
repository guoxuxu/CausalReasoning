  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and the integral transformation is the Laplace Transform. We study the effect of a linear differential operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\\\frac{dg}{dt} + g \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and then its Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed, will the transformed function match the Laplace Transform of the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without the operator applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the operator-applied function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g \\\\) results in a different representation in the s-domain. Specifically, applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) modifies the terms that involve s, resulting in \\\\( G(s) = s^2G(s) - s*g(0) - g'(0) - 2sG(s) + 2g(0) + G(s) \\\\), differing from the original transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
