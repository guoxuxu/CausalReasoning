  "Problem": "Assume a complex function space governed by the Laplace equation \\( \\nabla^2 z = 0 \\), where \\( z \\) is a function of complex variable \\( x+iy \\). We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( T(u) \\) defined as \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}u(t) dt \\), applied to functions within this space.\n\nIf \\( T(u) \\) is applied to a function \\( u_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\( \\nabla^2 z = 0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(x+iy, t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) remain the same as if \\( u_0 \\) was directly evolved without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(u) \\) by the integral changes the initial conditions by converting the function into its Laplace transform. Given that this transformation alters function properties, the evolution under \\( \\nabla^2 z = 0 \\) will differ, leading to a different result at time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
