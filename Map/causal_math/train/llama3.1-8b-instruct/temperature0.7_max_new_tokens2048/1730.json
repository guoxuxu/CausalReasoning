  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study how an integral transformation by the operator \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}v dt \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, affects the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\( v_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at T = t without knowing whether \\\\( T(v) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( T(v) \\\\), the integration effects of \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) on \\\\( v_0(x) \\\\) make it difficult to uniquely determine the original conditions, as multiple initial states could have led to the same observed outcome under different integrals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
