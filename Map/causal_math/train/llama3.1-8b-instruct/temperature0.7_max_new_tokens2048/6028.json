  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, in relation to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific interventions (whether \\\\( U(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was or were applied) be determined uniquely from the end result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), knowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions based solely on the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is problematic due to the overlapping effects of the matrix transformations and the integral's dependency on several variables. The contribution of each matrix (\\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\)) to the final result cannot be disentangled without additional information about the application of the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
