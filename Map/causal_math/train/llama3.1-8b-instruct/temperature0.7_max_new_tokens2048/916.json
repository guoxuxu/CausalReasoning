  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the effect of performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and k represents the transformed spatial variable.\n\nCan we accurately determine if an intervention occurred only by examining \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, T) \\\\) and knowing the form of \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether an intervention (such as a change from L to M) occurred merely from the endpoint \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(k, T) \\\\) and knowing \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) is unreliable. Multiple interventions or none could lead to similar transformed states at time T due to the properties of linear transformations and the potential similarity of effects from different operators in the Fourier space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
