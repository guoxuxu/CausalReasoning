  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the integration transformation applied to this function over a period \\\\(T\\\\), defined by the integral \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iAt} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( F(T) \\\\) from the integral transformation, can we determine the exact behavior or form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( F(T) \\\\) alone without the specific details of \\\\(A\\\\) does not provide sufficient information to reconstruct the exact behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval, as multiple configurations of \\\\(A\\\\) might yield identical integrals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
