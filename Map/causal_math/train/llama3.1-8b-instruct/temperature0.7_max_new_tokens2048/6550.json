  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We examine the system's response to the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( S \\\\) being a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we trace back to determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without clarity on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, because the transformation could have substantially altered the input. Without this knowledge, multiple distinct initial states could lead to the same observed endpoint due to the integration effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
