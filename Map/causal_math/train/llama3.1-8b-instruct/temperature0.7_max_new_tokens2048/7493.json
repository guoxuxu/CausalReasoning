  "Problem": "Consider a linear integral transformation given by \\\\(I[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} K(t, s) f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) is a kernel function. We investigate the impact of a control function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) added to the input function \\\\( f(s) \\\\), resulting in a modified input \\\\( f(s) + h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(s) = 0 \\\\) (i.e., no control function is applied), and the transformation is allowed to work on just \\\\( f(s) \\\\), will \\\\( I[f(t)] \\\\) be the same as when \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is not zero?",
  "Explanation": "With \\\\( h(s) = 0 \\\\), the integral transformation directly evaluates the impact of \\\\( f(s) \\\\) without modification. Introducing a non-zero \\\\( h(s) \\\\) modifies the input, thereby altering the resulting transformation output due to linear superposition properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
