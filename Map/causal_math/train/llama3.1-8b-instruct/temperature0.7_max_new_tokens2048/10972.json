  "Problem": "Imagine a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We explore the evolution of this function when subjected to transformations by linear operators in the form of integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result of a modified function where some unknown transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied, can we definitely determine solely the original parameter a?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, it's impossible to uniquely backtrack to determine a. The presence of any additional transformation like \\\\( h(t) \\\\) can significantly alter the dependency and obfuscate the value of a.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
