  "Problem": "Consider a two-variable system described by the equations \\\\(x' = x + 2y\\\\) and \\\\(y' = -2x + y\\\\). We explore the system's behavior under linear transformations and their combinations, denoted by matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(t) & -\\\\sin(t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(t) & \\\\cos(t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\), which rotates the state vector \\\\((x, y)\\\\).\n\nIf we intervene at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) with another transformation \\\\(N(t) = M(-t)\\\\) which is essentially the inverse of \\\\(M(t)\\\\), will the outcome \\\\((x(T), y(T))\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be equivalent to what it would be without either transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(N(t) = M(-t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) effectively reverses the rotation effect of the initial transformation \\\\(M(t_1)\\\\). If timed precisely and given \\\\(N(t)\\\\) exactly cancels out \\\\(M(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the vector would return to the path it would have without any intervention, assuming the dynamical system itself is not disturbed otherwise.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
