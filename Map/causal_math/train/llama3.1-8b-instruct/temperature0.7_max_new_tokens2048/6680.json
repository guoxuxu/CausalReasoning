  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( dz/dt = Hz \\\\), where H is a Hermitian matrix. An intervention is applied to the system using a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), with K being a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interactions between the exponential matrices of skew-Hermitian operators and the Hermitian matrix governing the system, multiple transformation paths can result in the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents the precise identification of which transformations were employed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
