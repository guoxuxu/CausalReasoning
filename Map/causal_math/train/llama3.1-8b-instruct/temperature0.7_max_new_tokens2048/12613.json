  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by the convolution integral \\\\( z(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input function, and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of the system represented using the Laplace transform as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). We investigate the changes when applying a scaling transformation \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scalar.\n\nIf it is observed that the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is scaled by a factor \\\\( k \\\\) at time $t$, can we conclusively determine that the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was scaled by \\\\( k \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and time-invariance of the system, a scaling observed in the output directly implies the same scaling in the input, assuming no other transformations occur within the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
