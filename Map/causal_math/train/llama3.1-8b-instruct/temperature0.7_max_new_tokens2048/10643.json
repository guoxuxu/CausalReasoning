  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a time-dependent variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) denoted as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Now assume the introduction of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), which alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = x(t)f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the resulting Laplace Transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) depend solely on the initial transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and not on the contributions from \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a second exponential function serves as another modification that affects the Laplace domain representation. The resultant Laplace Transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in addition to the original transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\), as it results in further shifting and complex interaction within the frequency domain, altering the outcome significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
