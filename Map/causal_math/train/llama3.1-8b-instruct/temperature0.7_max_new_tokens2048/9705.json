  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) at t = 0 and evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\) equal to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming that \\\\( s \\\\neq i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is directly calculable and yields \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) when the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) is greater than 0, demonstrating that the system's behavior follows expected analytical results without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
