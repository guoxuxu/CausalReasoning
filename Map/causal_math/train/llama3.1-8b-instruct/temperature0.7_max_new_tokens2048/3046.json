  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This function is transformed by the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\} \\\\). We explore whether causal relationships about the properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be discerned from the transformed function.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we confirm that the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is necessarily \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) without any additional terms?",
  "Explanation": "The form of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) uniquely corresponds to the exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) in the time-domain, with no additional terms. This relationship is precise in the context of Laplace transformation of pure exponentials.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
