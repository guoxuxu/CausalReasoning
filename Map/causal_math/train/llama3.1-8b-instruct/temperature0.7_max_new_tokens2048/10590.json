  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p(t)y = \\\\int_0^t k(s) y(s) ds \\\\), where p(t) and k(t) are given functions of time. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), with a transform function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} y(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( y(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at some \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output at \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) in this integro-differential system is influenced by both initial conditions through the Fourier transform and the time-integrated effect of the function \\\\( y(s) \\\\) over \\\\( [0, t] \\\\. These combined effects make it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( y(0) \\\\) without definitive knowledge about the application of the Fourier transform and the form of \\\\( k(t) \\\\) and \\\\( p(t) \\\\).",
