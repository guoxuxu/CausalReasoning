  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes analysis under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we precisely identify the transformations applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), merely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations used is infeasible from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone due to the same complex exponential scaling result attainable through numerous combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\). The presence of multiple possible pre-intervention and intervention scenarios that yield the same final state precludes unique determination.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
