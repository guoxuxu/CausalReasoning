  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t))(s) \\\\). Furthermore, let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) interact with another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) through a convolution, resulting in \\\\( y(t) = (x * v)(t) \\\\) which transforms to \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\) in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we deduce that the input was specifically \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without the addition of any other function like \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional constraints or information about potential additions to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), multiple combinations of functions (such as \\\\( x(t) + w(t) \\\\) where \\\\( W(s) = 0 \\\\)) could yield the same product \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\) after convolution with \\\\( v(t) \\\\). The presence of non-invertible transformations hinders the unique identification of the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
