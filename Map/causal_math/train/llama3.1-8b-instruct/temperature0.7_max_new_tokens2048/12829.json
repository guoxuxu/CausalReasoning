  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the z-plane, where z is a complex number, and is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We evaluate the effects of a transformation involving a linear operator T applied to the function, where \\\\( T(f(z)) = f'(z) \\\\), the derivative of the function.\n\nAfter observing the results of \\\\( T(f(z)) \\\\) at any point z in the z-plane, can we determine the initial function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at z = 0 without prior knowledge of the applied transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation results from the derivative might give certain insights about the changing rate and behavior of function at local points; however, without knowing the explicit transformation (derivative function used), determining the original function form just by observing its derivative at various points is not generally feasible due to possible multiple candidates for the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
