  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = u_0 + iv_0 \\\\) at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be altered by the transformation at t=T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) integrates the state over time, effectively changing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modified initial state influences how the solutions evolve under their respective differential equations, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
