  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nIf the initial conditions for \\( x(0) \\) are set and the system is left to evolve according to \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) without any additional transformations, will the behavior of \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be consistent with its evolution in the absence of the Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "As the Laplace transformation is not applied at all, the system evolves only under \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). This means that the impact of the transformation is non-existent, leaving \\( x(t) \\) to behave exclusively due to its inherent dynamics dictated by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
