  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) applied to a linear system characterized by \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number. The system's evolution is influenced by the Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\), which transforms \\( x(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nConsidering the frequency spectrum \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) at time T, can we determine precisely that \\( z(t) \\) was applied initially without knowing the natural frequencies of the untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the spectral properties encrypted in \\( D \\), it's challenging to distinguish whether the frequencies in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) result solely from the transformation \\( z(t) \\) or from the inherent features of the matrix \\( D \\). The spectrum might contain overlapping or closely linked frequency components making it ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
