  "Problem": "Consider a differential system expressed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix representing the dynamics of the system. We explore the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\{Dx\\\\})(s)\\\\) and observe how the system behaves with an intruding function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(t)x \\\\).\n\nConsidering the end state in the s-domain, can it be identified with certainty from what points interventions like \\\\(L = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\{Dx\\\\})(s)\\\\), or \\\\(g(x)\\\\), and in what order they were applied upon knowing only \\\\(x(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influence of matrix operations and function operations like the sine intervention results in a complex, intertwined frequency domain representation where the specifics of transformations and their sequence may not be clearly distinguishable. This ambiguity arises because both operations are integrated into the transformed state, making it challenging to decode the origins and interventions accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
