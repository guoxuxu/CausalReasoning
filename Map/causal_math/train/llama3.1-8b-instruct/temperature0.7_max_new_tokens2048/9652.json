  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore how the system behaves under different conditions when applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(t) = t^2 x(t)\\\\) and assessing the impact of this change across various scenarios.\n\nBased on the transformed signal's Laplace representation \\\\(H(s)\\\\) at the endpoint, can it be conclusively determined which transformations (\\\\(h(t)\\\\), \\\\(k(t)\\\\), or both) were applied throughout the interval?",
  "Explanation": "The compositional effects and multiple transformation influences make it difficult to uniquely backtrack to the specific interventions applied. The overlapping effects of the transformations in the Laplace domain add to this complexity, obscuring the exact sequence or presence of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
