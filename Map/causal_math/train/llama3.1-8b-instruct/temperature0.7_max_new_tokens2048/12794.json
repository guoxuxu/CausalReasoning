  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further complicates the system by potentially introducing dynamics governed by Q. Thus, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will be influenced by the interplay of M, N, and Q, altering the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
