  "Problem": "Analyze the causal interactions in a system where a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time) undergoes a Laplace transform to generate complex function \\\\( Z(s) = U(s) + iV(s) \\\\). We study the effects and the capability to reverse this transformation.\n\nCan the original functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) be perfectly reconstructed from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any additional information about the nature of the Laplace transform applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform is linear and bijective for functions of exponential order, given \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the original functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) can be entirely reconstructed through the inverse Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
