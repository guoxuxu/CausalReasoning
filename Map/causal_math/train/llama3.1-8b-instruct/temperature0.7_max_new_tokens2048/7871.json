  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform in the context of varying parameters \\\\( s \\\\). We analyze how complex functions and integral transformations relate in the inference of causality.\n\nAssuming an intervention where each coefficient inside matrix A is multiplied by a scalar factor \\\\( k \\\\) during the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before performing the Laplace transform, will the transformation's outcome be similar to when no modification was done to A?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying A by scaling alters the nature of \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\). This change impacts the Laplace transform results significantly, since the scaling affects the exponential growth or decay rates and the frequency components of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a different behavior in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
