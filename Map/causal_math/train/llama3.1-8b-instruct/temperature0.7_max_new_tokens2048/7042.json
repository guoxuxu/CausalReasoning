  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar, is analyzed for its effects over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), we cannot distinguish if the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was solely influenced by A and B, or if C also played a role early on. Different combinations of A, B, and C could yield the same end state at t = T, complicating backward deduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
