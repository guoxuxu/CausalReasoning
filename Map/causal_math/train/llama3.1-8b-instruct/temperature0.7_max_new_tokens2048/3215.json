  "Problem": "Consider a control system represented by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a control input. Analyze the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on this system.\n\nIf a new control protocol \\\\(u'(t)\\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), changing from the initial \\\\(u(t)\\\\), will the Laplace transform of the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on \\\\(M\\\\) and the initial \\\\(u(t)\\\\), ignoring \\\\(u'(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new control protocol \\\\(u'(t)\\\\) modifies the input to the system which in turn changes the resulting Laplace transform of \\\\(x(t)\\\\), making it depend on both the characteristics of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(u'(t)\\\\), in addition to the dynamics defined by \\\\(M\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
