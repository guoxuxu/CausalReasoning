  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and it's operated on by the Laplace transform defined by the integration transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). We examine how the operations affect the function over time and how interventions alter its behavior.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a linear operator represented by multiplication with a scalar \\\\( a \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, is the result \\\\( L[z(t) \\\\cdot a] \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) independent of the original function’s frequency component \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of the scalar \\\\( a \\\\) is a linear transformation, it directly scales the values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but does not remove or distort the influence of \\\\( w \\\\) on the transformed result. The result \\\\( L[z(t) \\\\cdot a] \\\\) for any \\\\( s \\\\) will still be dependent on \\\\( w \\\\), reflecting the original frequency characteristics altered by the scalar intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
