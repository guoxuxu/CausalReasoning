  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation system controlled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) applied to a set of differential equations. We explore scenarios involving both the initial application of transforms and subsequent interventions through inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}[F(s)] \\\\) at different stages.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), followed by the system evolution without further transformations, impact the end state as compared to direct evolution using \\\\( e^{At} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct application of the Laplace transform and its natural evolution through differential equations does not alter the fundamental properties of the function. Transforming it back at later times with the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\) yields the original function, thus preserving the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
