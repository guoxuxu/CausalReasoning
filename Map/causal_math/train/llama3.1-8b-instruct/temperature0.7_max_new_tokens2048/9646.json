  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from the observed \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) affects the initial state in a way that cannot be simply inverted without knowing the transformation details. The complex rotation could have modified the initial state's nature, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\( x_0 \\) without this information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
