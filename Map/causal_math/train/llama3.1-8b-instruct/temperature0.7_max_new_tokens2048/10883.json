  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 only depend on the behavior of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from 0 to \\( t_1 \\) and not on the earlier application of \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( g(z) \\) multiplies all prior effects by cubing the current value of \\( z(t) \\). This impact is influenced by whether \\( z(t) \\) had been squared at t = 0 by \\( f(z) \\), as the cubing interacts with however \\( z(t) \\) had been manipulated up until \\( t_1 \\), leading to a compounded transformation at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
