  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) by the operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tA} f(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The transformation is used to analyze the effect of the modified function over the interval [0, x].\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function at a specific point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within [0, x] by setting \\\\( f(t_1) = c \\\\) where c is a constant scalar, will this change the value of \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\) for x > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the function \\\\( f \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a discontinuity or a new value which affects the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to x. Since the integral accumulates these changes, the output \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\) is altered for all x greater than \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → T[f](x); t1 → f(t1); f(t1) = c → f(t1); t1 → x > t1; c → f(t1)"
