  "Problem": "Consider the flow behavior of a fluid characterized by the complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), where \\\\( w(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\) represents a complex potential in the z-plane. Analyze the effect of a conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is a complex function and evaluate its implications on the fluid flow.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new experimentally-induced transformation \\\\( z = e^{g(w)} \\\\) (where \\\\( g(w) \\\\) is another complex function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint flow pattern at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for T > t_1) depend solely on the original fluid dynamics and not on \\\\( f(w) \\\\) or \\\\( g(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( z = e^{g(w)} \\\\) as an intervention introduces another layer of complexity. Any resultant behavior of the fluid at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will depend not only on the inherent fluid dynamic properties but also on the effects of both \\\\( f(w) \\\\) and \\\\( g(w) \\\\), which could have significantly altered the domain and thus the fluid characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
