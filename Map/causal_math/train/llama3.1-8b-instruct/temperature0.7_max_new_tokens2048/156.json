  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^2 \\\\) defined over the complex numbers, and let \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\\\) be an integral transformation. Investigate the implications of this setup where \\\\( z \\\\) evolves as a complex function.\n\nGiven \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some point, can we conclusively determine if any intervention like adding a real or imaginary component was applied, just by analyzing the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does not uniquely identify if and what type of intervention was applied due to the complex nature of the exponential integral. Multiple differing inputs could result in similar outputs especially considering further possible transformations of the variable \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
