  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We also consider the impact of Laplace transformation on this function, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform of the modified z(t) (after introduction of the damping factor), can we determine if the damping was applied and the value of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), concurrently with identifying k and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The form of the Laplace transform after the damping intervention reveals all changes in the exponential term due to \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) along with the modified behavior of the function. Thus, one can extract k, \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and additionally identify the damping factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) from the altered Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
