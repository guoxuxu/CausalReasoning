  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being scalar constants. The system is analyzed using a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another scalar constant.\n\nCan we conclusively identify the specific interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) employed by only examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), multiple sequences of transformations could lead to the same outcome due to the scalar nature of C and D and their exponential effect on z. This non-uniqueness in potential paths and transformations precludes precise identification of which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
