  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor. We need to also consider an intervention by adjusting the temperature profile over time with a function \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), where \\\\( T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature and \\\\( k \\\\) is the rate of change of temperature.\n\nIf temperature \\\\( T \\\\) is set using a function \\\\( T = f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the reaction rate is then observed without further intervention, do changes in \\\\( k \\\\) directly determine the behavior of \\\\( R(T) \\\\) for all future times?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( R(T) \\\\) explicitly depends on \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( T \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), changes in the slope \\\\( k \\\\) will directly alter the temperature, which in turn directly affects the reaction rate \\\\( R(T) \\\\) at all future times following the Arrhenius equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
