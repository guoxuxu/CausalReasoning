  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and C is a real constant. The function undergoes an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applying a new function \\\\( S[z](t) = \\\\int_t^T e^{iCu}z(u) du \\\\) at a midway time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( iCz \\\\) dynamics with no influence from initial or midway transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( S[z] \\\\) introduces a backwards integral transformation which contrasts and potentially counteracts the effects of \\\\( T[z] \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the combination and interplay of the initial transformation, the dynamics under \\\\( iCz \\\\), and the intervention, all of which influence the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
