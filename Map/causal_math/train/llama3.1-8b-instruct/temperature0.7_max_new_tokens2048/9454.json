  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to precisely backtrack to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), determining the exact original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be certain. The transformation \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) adds a phase shift which, without the value of B, creates ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
