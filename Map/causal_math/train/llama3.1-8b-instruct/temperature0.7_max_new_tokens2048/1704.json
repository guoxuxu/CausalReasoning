  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We study the implications of a Laplace transformation given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) on this function over the complex variable z.\n\nKnowing the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\), can we determine which matrix (A or B) was used in the function before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform's outcome integrates the effects of the exponential terms and the decay factor introduced by s, which can mask clear distinctions between results from different matrix inputs (A or B). Unless the behavior of these matrices under the transform is unique, we cannot precisely pinpoint the matrix used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
