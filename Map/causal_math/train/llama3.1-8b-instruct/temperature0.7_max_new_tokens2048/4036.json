  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\), represented by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nGiven the output of the Fourier transform after an intervention by \\( h(s) \\), is it possible to determine precisely the initial function \\( z(t) \\) and its parameters (\\( \\omega \\) and \\( z_0 \\)), knowing only the final Fourier spectrum?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant Fourier spectrum after intervention is a superposition affected by both the original function and the filter effects. As such, identical spectral outputs could theoretically result from various combinations of \\( \\omega \\), \\( z_0 \\), and \\( h(s) \\), making unique identification of the initial parameters infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
