  "Problem": "We consider a complex function transformation in the context of an integral transformation. The initial function is \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original real-valued function. We analyze applying a transformation \\\\( h(t) = k(t) * f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( * \\\\) denotes convolution with a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without knowing whether the convolution with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( k(t) \\\\), the resultant function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) may reflect various original functions altered by different kernels. The integral transform with convolution makes it challenging to uniquely deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
