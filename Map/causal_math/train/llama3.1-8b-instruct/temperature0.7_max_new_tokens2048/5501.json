  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t=0, and then allowed to evolve under the function without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t=T after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be identical to the evolution of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) directly to t=T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) essentially modifies the original function by introducing a periodic modulation at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The resultant complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will have its real part (u) and imaginary part (v) influenced by the cosine and sine functions respectively, leading to a different trajectory in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
