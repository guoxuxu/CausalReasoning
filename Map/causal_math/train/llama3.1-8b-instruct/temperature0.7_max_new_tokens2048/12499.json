  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane. The function is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\), implying a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the final evaluation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after potential interventions of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( j(z) \\\\), can we definitively determine which transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used solely based on the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is impractical due to the non-linear and non-injective nature of the transformations \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) = -z \\\\). Multiple combinations and orders of applying these transformations could lead to the same final output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), creating ambiguity in tracing back the specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
