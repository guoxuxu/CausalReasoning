  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(X) \\\\), can we clearly identify the specific transformations (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) applied solely based on the value at \\\\( z(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) could potentially be achieved through multiple combinations of transformations and interventions. The complex interactions and compounded effects of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) make it ambiguous and challenging to pinpoint precisely which transformations were applied and when.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
