  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the temperature \\( T \\) of a substance is related to its electrical resistance \\( R \\) through the equation \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( R_0 \\) are constants. An additional thermal experiment involves the application of a function \\( g(T) = T + \\Delta T \\), where \\( \\Delta T \\) is a constant temperature change.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the value of \\( \\Delta T \\) used in \\( g(T) \\), solely based on observing \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\) at the end of the experiment?",
  "Explanation": "Given the exponential relationship in \\( R(T) \\) and the additive nature of \\( \\Delta T \\) in \\( g(T) \\), identical resistance values can be achieved through various combinations of \\( T \\) and \\( \\Delta T \\). Hence, distinguishing precisely between different \\( \\Delta T \\) values from \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\) alone is ambiguous without additional information about the base temperature \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
