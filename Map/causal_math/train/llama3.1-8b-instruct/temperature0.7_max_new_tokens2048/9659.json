  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a complex function. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\mu t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) along with the earlier application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) implies that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on all constants \\\\( \\lambda, \\mu, \\\\) and the function \\\\( p(t) \\\\). The transformations introduce separate modifying factors affecting the trajectory and ultimately the state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
