  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function is evaluated and then transformed using the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). The system's behavior over the complex plane is considered under this transformation.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by altering \\\\( A \\\\) to a new matrix \\\\( B \\\\) at some moment, and then the Fourier transform is reapplied, will the characteristics of the new transform at any point only depend on \\\\( B \\\\) and not on the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the underlying function to \\\\( f'(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\), but the extents to which characteristics of the transform depend solely on \\\\( B \\\\) are influenced by the state of the system at the moment of intervention. The history embedded by \\\\( A \\\\) prior to changing it to \\\\( B \\\\) affects the overall transformation, yielding dependency on both matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
