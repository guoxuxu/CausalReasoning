  "Problem": "Consider a linear electrical circuit analysis where the voltage, \\\\( V(t) \\\\), across a resistor and inductor in series is described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), with R as resistance, L as inductance, and I as the current. Let's analyze the scenario where an operation is performed to transform the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(I) = I^2 \\\\) just before starting the system.\n\nIf an intervention using a function \\\\( j(I) = 3I \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\), for T > t_1 depend solely on R and L without being affected by the squaring of the initial current?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(I) \\\\) multiplies the current by three but does not reset or negate the influences of the initial current squaring. Therefore, the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) is impacted by both the squaring and tripling operations, meaning it depends not only on R and L but also the earlier changes to the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
