  "Problem": "Consider the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\\\) over a closed contour C in the complex plane, where a and w are constants, and w lies inside C. This transformation explores the impact of parameter 'a' on function behavior around singular point w.\n\nIf an intervention modifies 'a' to 'a + b' at a certain t during the computation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), where b is a constant, will the final value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely depend on the new value of 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the parameter dynamically, and thus the resulting function depends not only on the new parameter 'a + b' but also on the original parameter 'a' during areas of the path contour prior to the intervention, as well as the interaction of these parameters with the pole w.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
