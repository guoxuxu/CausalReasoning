  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nBy knowing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( T[z](T) = -\\\\frac{e^{i \\\\omega T} - 1}{i \\\\omega} \\\\) depends on the exponential term and inversely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). As \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is under a complex exponential and inside a division, other frequencies satisfying certain conditions might produce the same output because of periodicity, leading to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
