  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the function \\\\( p(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) represents the pressure at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). The evolution of pressure is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Now, analyze the scenario under transformation given by the function \\\\( h(p) = e^{-kt} p \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(p) \\\\) is applied to the initial pressure distribution \\\\( p_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( p(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( p_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(p) \\\\) alters the initial condition by scaling it down by \\\\( e^{-kT} \\\\). Consequently, the subsequent evolution of the system under diffusion still reflects this initial modification, leading to a final state that differs from the untransformed scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
