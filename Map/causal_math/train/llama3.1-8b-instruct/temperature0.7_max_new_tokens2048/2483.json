  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Ku\\\\), where D is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics, and K is a control matrix. The input u(t) is an external control function. We examine the impact of a Laplace transform on the control signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\) and its repercussions on the system's response.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is made by switching the control function to a new \\\\( v(t) = P(t)u(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( P(t) \\\\) is another transformation), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on the transformations U(s) or P(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( v(t) = P(t)u(t) \\\\) alters the control input in a way that affects how the control influence propagates through the system defined by D and K. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends not only on the system dynamics D but also on the control transformations U(s) and P(t), which modify how the input interacts with the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
