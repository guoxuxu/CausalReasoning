  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore how the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix\\\\xi} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at time t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T under the Fourier transform evolve similarly to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the representation from spatial domain to frequency domain, altering how the operator L acts on \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). This transformation can potentially change the solution significantly due to the modification of boundary conditions and internal structure of L in the frequency space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
