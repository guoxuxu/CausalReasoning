  "Problem": "Consider a system where the response \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is related to the input \\\\( f(x) \\\\) via the convolution integral \\\\( u(x) = (h * f)(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is an impulse response function. We will explore scenarios involving transformations by a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined by \\\\( T[f](x) = f(x - a) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant shift.\n\nIf at a certain position \\\\( x_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( T_2 \\\\) defined by \\\\( T_2[f](x) = f(x + b) \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant shift) is applied as an intervention, will the final output \\\\( u(x) \\\\) depend only on the impulse response \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not on the shifts \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( T_2 \\\\) introduces another shift, making the final output dependent on both the shifts \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in addition to the impulse response \\\\( h(x) \\\\). These shifts can change the location of the inputs which affects the output due to the nature of convolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
