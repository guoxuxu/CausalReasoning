  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze the effect of an initial condition transformed by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the starting condition of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Nt}x \\\\) modifies the trajectory depending on the interaction between the matrices M and N, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) would generally be different unless M and N are specifically related (e.g., commute).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
