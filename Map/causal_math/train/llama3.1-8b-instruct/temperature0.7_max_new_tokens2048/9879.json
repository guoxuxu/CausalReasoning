  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constants. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system, where C is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where D is another constant), is the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 dependent solely on the dynamics defined by A and B, and not by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) introduces a new dynamic element, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interplay of A, B, C, and D. The system's trajectory and endpoint are influenced by both initial and intervened complex exponential transformations, leading to a result that reflects all these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
