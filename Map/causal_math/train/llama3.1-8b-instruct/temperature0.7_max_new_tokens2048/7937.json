  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf the integral transformation is applied at z = 0 and the function is then evaluated at z = Z without any further alteration, will the outcome \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) be equivalent to directly evaluating \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation introduces an additive constant term to the original function, representing the accumulated effect over the interval. Thus, this alters the function's behavior fundamentally, leading to a different result at z = Z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
