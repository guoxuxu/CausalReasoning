  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nIf an intervention employing a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 solely rely on M and ignore the effects of D and F?",
  "Explanation": "The further intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the system state yet again, adding another layer impacted by F in addition to D and the ongoing influence of M. These changes cumulatively influence the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), reflecting contributions from all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
