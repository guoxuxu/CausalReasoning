  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the signal vector \\\\( z_0 = [u(0), v(0)]^T \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves without further interference, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly transformed under the usual process?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) changes the initial components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a different complex function evolution. This alteration impacts the frequency components of the transform, resulting in a different Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
