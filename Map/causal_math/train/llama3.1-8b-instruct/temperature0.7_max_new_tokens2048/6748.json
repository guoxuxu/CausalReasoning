  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \\\\), used as a transformation within the context of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). The system investigates how transformations affect the Laplace transform of the function over the variable s.\n\nKnowing the final outcome \\\\( T[h](s) \\\\) at s = 2, can we accurately determine whether the intervening transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 g(z) \\\\) was applied, based solely on the Laplace transform outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform result, even if distinct, does not provide sufficient specifics to uniquely determine whether the specific intervening transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 g(z) \\\\) was applied. The transformation outcome could be mimicked or altered by other possible function transformations or different parameter changes in s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
