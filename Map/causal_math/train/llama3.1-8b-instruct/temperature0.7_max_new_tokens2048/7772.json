  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u\\\\) and investigate its implications over variable \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nCan we confirm the specific transformation sequences applied (either \\\\(e^{Az}\\\\), \\\\(e^{Cz}\\\\), or any combination thereof) based solely on observing the final Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(z))\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform result encapsulates combined effects and interplays due to exponential transformations influenced by A and C. Given the broad range of potential transformation effects and their overlap in frequency space, it is impractical to pinpoint precise transformation sequences without other contextual or time-domain data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
