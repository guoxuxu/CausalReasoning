  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario with the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{st} \\\\). An external intervention uses the Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to modify the function before its evolution.\n\nKnowing the output of the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we exactly trace back whether the Fourier transform was applied prior to the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Both transforms modify the function in ways that are generally irreversible and non-informative about prior states uniquely, particularly due to the transformations altering different spectral components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
