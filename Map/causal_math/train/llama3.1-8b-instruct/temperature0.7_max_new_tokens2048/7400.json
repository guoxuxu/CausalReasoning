  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\widetilde{u}(s, T) \\\\) at T, can we conclusively determine the types and sequence of transformations applied (Fourier, Laplace, or both) based solely on \\\\( \\\\widetilde{u}(s, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\( \\\\widetilde{u}(s, T) \\\\), it is challenging to uniquely back-calculate and distinguish the effects and sequence of Fourier or Laplace transformations or both. The transformations could yield overlapping effects especially in their influences on how the diffusion process was modified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
