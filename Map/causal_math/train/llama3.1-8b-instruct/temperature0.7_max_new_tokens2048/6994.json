  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) that transforms a function \\( u(x) \\) using a convolution integral \\( L[u](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x - t)u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( k \\) is the kernel function. We scrutinize the effects of an initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) and its interaction with different kernels, including potential changes in kernel midway.\n\nGiven the output \\( L[u](x) \\) at a later time T, can we accurately infer the initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) assuming only kernel \\( k_1(x) \\) was applied, even if we don't initially know the input?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the input \\( u_0(x) \\) or the full property of \\( k_1(x) \\), it's typically not feasible to uniquely backtrack and determine \\( u_0(x) \\) given the multitude of functions that could potentially yield the same convolution output with \\( k_1(x) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u_0(x) → L[u](x); L[u](x) → T; k_1(x) → L[u](x); L[u](x) → u_0(x); k_1(x) → u_0(x)"
