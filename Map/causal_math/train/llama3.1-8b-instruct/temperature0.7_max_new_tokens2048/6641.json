  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time t, where B is also a real constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is implemented on a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\), which transforms the vector's orientation and magnitude in the complex plane. This initial change influences the entire subsequent trajectory under the influence of \\\\( iA \\\\), leading to a different state at any later time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
