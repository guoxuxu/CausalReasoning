  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). Let us examine the causal effects and inferences in systems characterized by convolution and multiplication operations in the Laplace domain leading to end solutions in time domain.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is convolved with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( (h * g)(t) \\\\), followed by its transformation to the Laplace domain without other operations, does the resultant \\\\( H(s)G(s) \\\\) represent the accurate transformation of \\\\( (h * g)()(t) \\\\) to the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem states that convolution in time domain corresponds to multiplication in the Laplace domain. Therefore, \\\\( (h * g)(t) \\\\) correctly transforms to \\\\( H(s)G(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, accurately representing the cause (convolution of h and g) and its effect (resulting function in Laplace domain).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
