  "Problem": "Consider a system that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector field representing velocity. We investigate how performing a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), affects the evolution of the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is modified at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying an intervention, say addition of a function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\), and then proceeding, will the resulting function at time \\\\( T \\\\) (> \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) be expressed simply by the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) + \\\\hat{g}(k, t_1) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution's form after the intervention will account for the nonlinear transformations introduced by \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\). The resultant \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) involves not only the superposition of the Fourier transforms but also the changes in characteristics caused by \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) which aren't strictly linear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
