  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We explore the impact of applying an additional operation defined by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a complex function in the s-domain.\n\nIf at a certain frequency \\\\( s_1 \\\\), another transfer function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting function \\\\( G(s)H(s)F(s) \\\\) depend solely on the original transfer function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( H(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed function \\\\( G(s)H(s)F(s) \\\\) is dependent not only on the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) but is notably affected by the additional transformations introduced by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The resultant function in the s-domain and consequently in the time-domain (via inverse Laplace transform) will reveal the cumulative effects of these operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
