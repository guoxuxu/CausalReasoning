  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents a control input. When a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx\\\\), with \\\\(Q\\\\) as a constant matrix, is applied, the dynamic response characteristics of the system are altered.\n\nCan we ascertain the specific interventions employed (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) simply by examining the system state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting system state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of the transformations \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\), as well as different control inputs \\\\(u\\\\) over time. The overlapping influences and potential sameness of trajectory despite different transformation histories render it impossible to precisely deduce the interventions from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
