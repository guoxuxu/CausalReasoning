  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the variable z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant, and i is the imaginary unit. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is also a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, would the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by changes introduced by both B and C?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the resulting state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on the transformations and their effects imposed by both B and C. Each transformation alters the phase or magnitude independently, thereby influencing the overall state evolution affecting the system in compounded manners.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
