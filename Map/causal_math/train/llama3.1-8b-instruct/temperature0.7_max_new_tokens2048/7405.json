  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how the convolution of another function, \\\\( h(t) \\\\), impacts g(t) in terms of their transforms. Assume both functions are well-behaved and their transforms exist.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\) is computed, and then the Laplace Transform is applied to the resulting function, will the Laplace Transform of the convolution be the same as the product of the individual Laplace Transforms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem, the Laplace Transform of the convolution of two functions equals the product of their individual Laplace Transforms. Therefore, the transform of \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\) will be \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\times L[h(t)] \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
