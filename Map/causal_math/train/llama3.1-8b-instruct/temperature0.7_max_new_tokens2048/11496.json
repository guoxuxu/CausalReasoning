  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and w is a complex variable. Suppose we perform an integral transformation on z(w) given by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sw}z(w) dw \\\\), where s is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the resultant output \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\), can we specifically identify whether the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) or the intervened function \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was used throughout, only based on the endpoint value of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) might not clearly differentiate if \\\\( e^{Aw} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{Cw}e^{Aw} \\\\) (from the intervention) was applied due to overlaps in potential effects caused by A and C in the exponential terms. The complex integration involving s can further obscure the precise contributions of either function to the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
