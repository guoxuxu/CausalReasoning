  "Problem": "We postulate a scenario involving the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t) \\) and its effect when used in conjunction with an integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, applied to a function \\( h(t) \\) that represents a physical system's response.\n\nIf a function \\( h(t) \\) is convoluted with \\( \\delta(t) \\) and then transformed using the Laplace Transform, will the transform result be the same as if \\( h(t) \\) were transformed directly without convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\( h(t) \\) with \\( \\delta(t) \\) results in \\( h(t) \\) itself because \\( \\delta(t) \\) is the identity element for convolution. Therefore, the Laplace Transform of the convoluted function is identical to the transform of the original function \\( h(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
