  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is multiplied by a damping factor \\\\( e^{-αt} \\\\) (where \\\\( α > 0 \\\\)) before applying the Fourier transform, will the transform \\\\( F(ω) \\\\) still show a peak exactly at \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the damping factor modifies the original function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}e^{-αt} \\\\), which changes the frequency response. The resultant Fourier transform shifts the peak from \\\\( ω \\\\) due to the damping, leading to a broadened response and not a peak exactly at \\\\( ω \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
