  "Problem": "Consider a complex function Z, where Z(s) = integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) * cos(t) dt. We are exploring the impact of applying a Laplace transformation to this function and subsequent transformations defined by the operation G(Z) = 1/(s^2 + 1).\n\nSuppose a new transformation H(Z) = sZ is introduced at a time t_1 post the Laplace transformation but before applying G. Will the final expression of G(Z) at time T > t_1 include the effects of H?",
  "Explanation": "The insertion of H(Z) modifies Z by a factor of s, changing the entire basis of Z before G is applied. This intervention affects the final outcome of G(Z), incorporating not only the transformational impact of L but also the effect of H, leading to a transformed function that reflects both actions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
