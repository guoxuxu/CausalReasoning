  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. We examine the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) to the system, where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any t > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the initial state by a multiplicative factor that evolves with time, changing the trajectory of the system from what would be produced by the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
