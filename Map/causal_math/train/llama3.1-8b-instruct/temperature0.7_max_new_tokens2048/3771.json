  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega' s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the resulting function only depend on the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( U \\\\) modifies this trajectory by integrating with a different exponential kernel, so the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will depend on both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) and their relative kernels. This compounded effect makes the endpoint reliant on the history and nature of each transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
