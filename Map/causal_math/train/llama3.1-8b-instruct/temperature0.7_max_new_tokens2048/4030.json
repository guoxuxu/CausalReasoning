  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effects of modifying the system with a transformation represented by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to retrieve the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the final state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking information on whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied creates an ambiguity, as the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) might adjust the initial conditions such that they cannot be simply reconstructed from the final state, especially if \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
