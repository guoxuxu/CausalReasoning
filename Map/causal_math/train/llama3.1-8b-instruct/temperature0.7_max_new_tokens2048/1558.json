  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function transformation on a real function g(x) over the domain [0, 1]. The transformation is defined by T(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(iπsx) g(s) ds, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nAfter observing the output of the transformation T on g at any x, can we infer the exact form of g(x) over [0, 1] without knowing T was specifically applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation T mixes information about g across its domain due to the integral and exponential operation, making it inherently challenging to deconvolve and recover g exactly from the output of T without clear knowledge about the transformation's form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "observing T(g)(x) → knowing g(x) directly; observing T(g)(x) → knowing the integral of e^(iπsx) g(s) ds; observing T(g)(x) → knowing the value of i; observing T(g)(x) → knowing the limits of integration (0, 1)"
