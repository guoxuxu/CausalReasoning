  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we deduce precisely which interventions (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could be the result of various combinations of interventions due to linear superposition, and the specific individual impact of each intervention (how much was shifted by \\\\( c \\\\) or by \\\\( d \\\\)) cannot be discerned solely from the final value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\). Multiple scenarios could yield the same final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
