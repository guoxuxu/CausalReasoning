  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamic system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant square matrix. The impact on the system's trajectory of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also constant matrices, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlapping effects and the non-commutative nature of the exponential transformations in the intervention matrices, multiple combinations of transformations could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This makes it challenging to identify the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
