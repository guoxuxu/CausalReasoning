  "Problem": "In a control theory context, consider the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) where C and D are constant matrices, and u is a control input. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform on the system's response, particularly through an impulse response represented by matrix H, where H is defined as the transformation \\\\(H(s) = C^{-1}D\\\\).\n\nIf a modification is applied to the matrix D to become \\\\(D'\\\\) at t = t_1 as an intervention, and the input u remains an impulse at t = 0, will the new Laplace transform of the output Y'(s) still directly yield H(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification in D to \\\\(D'\\\\) alters the system's response characteristics, specifically changing the impulse response matrix from H(s) to \\\\((C^{-1}D')\\\\). This intervention changes the output transform, and thus Y'(s) will yield a different transform, not H(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modification of D → Change in H(s); Change in H(s) → Change in Y'(s); Intervention at t = t_1 → Modification of D; Input u at t = 0 → H(s)"
