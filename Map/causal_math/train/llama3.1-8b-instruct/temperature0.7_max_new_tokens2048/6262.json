  "Problem": "Analyzing an electrical system described by the voltage-current relationship using Laplace Transformations. Let \\\\( V(s) = Z(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) \\\\), \\\\( I(s) \\\\), and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of voltage, current, and impedance, respectively. Consider varying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by adding a capacitor with impedance \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\\\), where C is the capacitance.\n\nHaving measured \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and knowing \\\\( I(s) \\\\), can we confidently determine whether a capacitor was added to a system originally containing only an inductor, without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "From the measurement of \\\\( V(s) \\\\) alone and even knowing \\\\( I(s) \\\\), one cannot uniquely determine if the impedance change is due solely to an added capacitor or other possible changes in the system. Additional specific system characteristics or historical impedance data are needed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
