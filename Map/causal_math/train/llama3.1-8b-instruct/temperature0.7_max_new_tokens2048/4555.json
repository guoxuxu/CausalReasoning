  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time a modification is made such that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i \\\\omega + a) t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, will the integral transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) be independent of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the term \\\\( a \\\\) affects the exponential decay rate in \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which directly influences the convergence behavior and outcome of the integral transform. The result of \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) becomes sensitive not only to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but now also significantly to \\\\( a \\\\), whereby \\\\( a \\\\) affects both the convergence condition and the resulting transformed function's form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "modification → change in z(t); change in z(t) → change in T[z(t)]; T[z(t)] → independence from a"
