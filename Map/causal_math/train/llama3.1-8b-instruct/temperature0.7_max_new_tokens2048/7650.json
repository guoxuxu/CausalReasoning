  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, acting on the time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). We examine the effect of Fourier Transform on \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and explore how these transformations influence causal relationships.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), but unaware that \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) was applied, can we accurately deduce the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any distortion or loss?",
  "Explanation": "By recognizing the characteristic frequency shift of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the transformed signal's spectrum, one can correctly recover \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by applying an inverse shift in the frequency domain, assuming knowledge of the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The inverse Fourier Transform can then regenerate \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from modified spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
