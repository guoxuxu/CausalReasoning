  "Problem": "Suppose we have a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. Consider the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a square matrix, at various times.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( U(x) = Nx \\\\) (where N is another square matrix) is applied as an intervention, and we let the system evolve to time T, will the result at time T be dependent solely on the matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new transformation, modifying the trajectory of the system. As a result, the final state depends on the matrices D, M, and N. The specific influence of each depends on their respective properties and how they interact when applied sequentially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
