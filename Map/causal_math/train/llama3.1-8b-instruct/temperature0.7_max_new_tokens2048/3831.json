  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), particularly under the influence of a derivative operation, defined by \\\\( g(t) = d^n(t) / dt^n \\\\) where n is a positive integer.\n\nIf after time \\\\(t=0\\\\) another operation, such as an integral transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\), is also applied to \\\\(f(t)\\\\), then taking the Laplace transform, will the final result be independent of the initial nth derivative operation on \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The composite effect of both derivative and integral operations on \\\\(f(t)\\\\) significantly alters it. The outcomes in the Laplace domain are cumulative, involving properties of both operations. It is impossible to negate the effect of the initial derivative just by applying a subsequent operation such as integration; the specific operations are encoded distinctly in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
