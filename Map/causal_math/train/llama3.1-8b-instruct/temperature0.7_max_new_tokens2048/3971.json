  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\) affecting z such that a new function \\\\(w(t)\\\\) is introduced and allowed to evolve under the same differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), will the endpoint Fourier transform \\\\(F[w(T)]\\\\) where T > t_1, be solely influenced by the initial dynamics up to \\\\(t_1\\\\) and not by the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform as an intervention changes the form of the function \\\\(w(t)\\\\) dramatically, generally introducing new components in both frequency and time-domain representation. This alteration significantly affects the resultant function at any time T > t_1, making \\\\(F[w(T)]\\\\) dependent on both the initial dynamics and the character of the Laplace intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
