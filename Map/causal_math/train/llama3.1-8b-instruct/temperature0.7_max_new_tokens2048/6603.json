  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We explore the behavior of the function under different transformations and integration conditions.\n\nIf a linear transformation \\\\( h(x) = ax + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants) is applied before computing \\\\( z(x) \\\\), will the result of \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\) only depend on x and not on the coefficients of h?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation affects the variable passed to \\\\( z \\\\). This means the integration limits and the function form integrate over a different range and a modified argument, respectively. As such, the outcomes will indeed depend on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) of \\\\( h \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
