  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the following operator equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(x) = D^2x + 2x \\) where \\( D \\) represents the differential operator with respect to variable \\( t \\). Assess how the introduction of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) modifies the system.\n\nBased on the function \\( \\mathcal{G}(x(t)) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\), can we conclusively identify whether the initial transformation applied was \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), or both, by observing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T > t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformational effects imposed by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) can interfere in such a way that distinguishing between these or their combination based on \\( x(t) \\) is not clear-cut. The integral transformations can blend the effects making it intricate to deconvolve the original or intermediate sourcing alterations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
