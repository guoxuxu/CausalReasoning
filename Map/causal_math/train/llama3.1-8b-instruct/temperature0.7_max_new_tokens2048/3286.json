  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) ds \\), representing the output of a linear time-invariant system with state-space matrices A and B, and input \\( u(t) \\). Let's explore how the introduction of a transformation \\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\), where C and D are constant matrices, affects the system.\n\nWithout any prior knowledge of whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied, can we recover the original input function \\( u(t) \\) from the observed output \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\) impacts the output in such a way that it could be fundamentally different from what would have been observed without its application. This variation introduced by \\( f(z) \\) compromises the straightforward retrieval of \\( u(t) \\) from \\( z(T) \\) without details of the intervening transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
