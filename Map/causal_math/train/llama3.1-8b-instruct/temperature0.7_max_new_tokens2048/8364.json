  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the dynamics of this function under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we exactly deduce the intervention value \\\\( u \\\\) if we observe the Fourier transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) concentrated at a frequency different from \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the original frequency was known to be \\\\( w \\\\) and the observed peak in the Fourier transform occurred at \\\\( w+u \\\\), we can explicitly calculate the intervention value \\\\( u \\\\) as the difference between the observed peak and the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
