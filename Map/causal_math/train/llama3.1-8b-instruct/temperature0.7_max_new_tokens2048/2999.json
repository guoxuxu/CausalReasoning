  "Problem": "Investigate the scenario where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{Cx} \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is integrated into the dynamic determined by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\), D being another constant matrix. Analyze the evolution when the transformation \\\\( g(x) = z(x) * u(x) \\\\) is introduced.\n\nAssuming a new function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ex} \\\\) (where E is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention at some point \\\\( x_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( u(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 be solely determined by D and not influenced by either C or E?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the state at point \\\\( u(X) \\\\) becomes a function not only of D but also influenced by transformations encapsulated by C and E. Their effects on the evolution of the system state through their exponential factors mean that the endpoint \\\\( u(X) \\\\) will depend on C, D, and E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
