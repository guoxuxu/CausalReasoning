  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the system's change under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions used to reach \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the overlapping influences of \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\). These transformations could result in the same end state from multiple different routes or intervention combinations, leading to ambiguity in determining the exact sequence of events.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
