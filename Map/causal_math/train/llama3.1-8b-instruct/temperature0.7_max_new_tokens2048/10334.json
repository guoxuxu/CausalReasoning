  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We're studying the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) over the interval [0,T] after observing the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the specific functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during that interval?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) provides a time-integrated, compound effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the interval which loses specific time-dependent information about \\\\( z(s) \\\\) on [0, T]. Deriving exact \\\\( z(s) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T isn't feasible without additional information about the function's form.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
