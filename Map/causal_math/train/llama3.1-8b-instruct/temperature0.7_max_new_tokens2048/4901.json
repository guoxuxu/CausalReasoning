  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) in a complex function domain, where \\( A \\) is a complex constant matrix and \\( x \\) is an initial complex vector. This setup is used to analyze the system's behavior under transformations involving integral transformations such as the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) undergoes the transformation defined by \\( z(t) \\) and is subjected to natural progression under \\( z'(t) = Az(t) \\) with \\( z(0) = x \\), does the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) of this system at a later time \\( T \\) equal the Laplace Transform of \\( x(t) \\) naturally evolved without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( e^{At}x \\) changes the initial conditions and system dynamics under \\( z'(t) \\), affecting subsequent outcomes significantly. Hence, the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) will reflect these changes and not be equivalent to that of the naturally evolved \\( x(t) \\) without this specific transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
