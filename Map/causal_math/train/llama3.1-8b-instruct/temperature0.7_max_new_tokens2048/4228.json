  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after a potential series of interventions modifying \\\\( k \\\\), can we determine which interventions were applied based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining interventions solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the combined and integrated effects of changes in \\\\( k \\\\), the evolution governed by the differential equation, and any transformations like \\\\( T(z) \\\\) that might have been applied. The overlapping impacts and potential variety of equivalence in resulting states preclude clear inference back to specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
