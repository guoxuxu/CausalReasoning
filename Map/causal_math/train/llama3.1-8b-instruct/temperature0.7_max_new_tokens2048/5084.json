  "Problem": "Consider a series of kinematic equations \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t) = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\vec{a}t^2\\\\) in a physics simulation space, where \\\\(\\\\vec{a}\\\\) is the acceleration vector. Analyze how applying a transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that scales and rotates the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) affects the position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) over time.\n\nConsidering the final position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(T)\\\\), can the specific transformations used (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) be identified uniquely just by knowing the position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(T)\\\\) may result from various configurations of initial and intervening transformations due to the complex interactions between the scaling and rotations imparted by \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). This multitude of possible transformation combinations leading to the same endpoint complicates the precise identification of the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
