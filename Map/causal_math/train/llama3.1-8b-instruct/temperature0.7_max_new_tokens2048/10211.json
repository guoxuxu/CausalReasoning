  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) to the system and later reversing it, as well as the transformation by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where M is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some intermediate time t = \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the ultimate state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be influenced only by D and not by M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The newly introduced transformation \\\\( k(x) \\\\) affects the trajectory further, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on M, N, as well as D. This is due to the potential non-commutative nature of the exponential matrices, which means the system's behavior is dependent on all involved transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
