  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIf \\( h(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z \\) evolves according to \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( h(z) \\) changes the initial state by a rotation of \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\), which directly influences the trajectory of the solution \\( z(t) \\). Thus, \\( z(t) \\) at T will be \\( e^{i\\omega T}z_0 e^{kT} \\), different from \\( z_0 e^{kT} \\) had \\( h(z) \\) not been applied initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
