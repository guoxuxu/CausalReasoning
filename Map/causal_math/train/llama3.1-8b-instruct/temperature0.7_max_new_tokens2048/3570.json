  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex constant vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to this function over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original constant vector \\\\( w \\\\) after observing the Fourier transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) gives us the frequency components of the signal, which are shifted according to \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( A \\\\), it is impossible to accurately revert the frequency shift to recover \\\\( w \\\\) fully because the phase shift introduced by \\\\( A \\\\) in the transformation is undetermined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
