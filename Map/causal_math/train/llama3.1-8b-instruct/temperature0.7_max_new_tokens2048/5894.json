  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t. Analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the function.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, is it possible to precisely determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, assuming no other information but \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is available?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific value of a, or whether a transformation was applied at all, multiple scenarios could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). For example, differing values of a could adjust the phase and amplitude at t = 0 such that they evolve to the same point at T, due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
