  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a complex constant. We analyze how a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), the initial condition at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without additional interventions, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some later time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) at the initial time modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{Qt}z_0 \\\\). The resultant trajectory is influenced by the transformation, resulting in the expression \\\\( z(T) = e^{PT} \\\\times e^{QT}z_0 \\\\), which is different unless \\\\( Q = 0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
