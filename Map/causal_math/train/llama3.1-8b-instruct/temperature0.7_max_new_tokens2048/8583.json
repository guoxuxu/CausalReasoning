  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) with a constant coefficient K. Analyze the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(u) = Cu \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied to the initial condition.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( i(u) = Du \\\\) (D being another constant matrix) is used as an intervention, will the solution at \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected only by \\\\( K \\\\) and not by \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T is affected not only by K but also by the nature of C and D. The initial intervention changes the state to \\\\( Cu_0 \\\\), and the second to \\\\( De^{Kt_1}(Cu_0) \\\\), making the system's final state at T reliant on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
