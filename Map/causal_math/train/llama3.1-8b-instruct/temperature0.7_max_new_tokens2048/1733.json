  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Mx + u\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix and \\(u\\) is a control input. We examine the influence of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\), with \\(N\\) being another constant matrix, on the system’s trajectory.\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to an initial vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( x \\) evolves under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\) without any control intervention (\\(u = 0\\)), will \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was simply allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Mx\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( h(x) \\) changes the initial state \\( x_0 \\) to \\( e^{N0}x_0 = x_0 \\). However, since the transformation is time-dependent, \\( x(t) = e^{Nt}x(t) \\) is not generally the same as \\( e^{Mt}x_0 \\). The eigenspaces influenced by \\( N \\) could modify the trajectory differently than those only influenced by \\( M \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
