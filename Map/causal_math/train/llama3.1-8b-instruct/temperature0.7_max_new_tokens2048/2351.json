  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nIf during the transformation process an additional filter \\( G(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\) after \\( H(f) \\) and before inverse transformation, will \\( y(t) \\) at the conclusion of this augmented process solely reflect the initial effect of \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\( G(f) \\) as an intervention fundamentally alters \\( Y(f) \\) (the product of \\( X(f) \\) with \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\)), complicating the resulting \\( y(t) \\). The final output is influenced by both \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\), not just \\( H(f) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
