  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve according to its rule without further modification, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any time T be influenced by the matrix \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is wholly independent of \\\\( B \\\\) and solely depends on \\\\( A \\\\). The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane is governed by the exponentiation with \\\\( iA \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) playing no role.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
