  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the continuous Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain signal. We analyze the impact of a modulation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the final frequency spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}''(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence or individual modulation constants used (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)), only by analyzing the shifted spectrum?",
  "Explanation": "The shifted frequency spectrum only indicates the cumulative frequency shift but does not provide information about the order or the individual values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Different combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) could result in the same total frequency shift, causing ambiguity in determining the sequence or values of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
