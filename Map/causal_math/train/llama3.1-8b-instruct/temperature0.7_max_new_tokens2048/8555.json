  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nIf the external force \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), say \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), can the system's response at time T be found by only solving the homogeneous equation?",
  "Explanation": "With the application of the force, the system's behavior is influenced by both the inherent characteristics of the system and the external intervention. The response at time T will be described by both the homogeneous and particular solutions, where the latter directly considers the impact of the external force.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
