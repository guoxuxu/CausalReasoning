  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) in a region \\( \\Omega \\). An external boundary condition is applied as \\( u = 0 \\) on \\( \\partial \\Omega \\). We investigate the response of the system when subjected to an internal potential \\( f(z) = \\sin(kz) \\), where \\( z \\) and \\( k \\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is introduced at \\( z_0 \\) in \\( \\Omega \\) at the beginning, and the system evolves according to \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( u(z) \\) at any other point \\( z \\) in \\( \\Omega \\) remain unaffected by \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( f(z) \\) as an internal potential modifies the harmonic function \\( u(z) \\) throughout the domain \\( \\Omega \\). Even though \\( \\Delta u = 0 \\) guarantees \\( u \\) as a harmonic function, the specific modification at \\( z_0 \\) influences the distribution of \\( u \\) due to the properties of harmonic functions to adjust over the entire domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
