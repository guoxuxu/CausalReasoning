  "Problem": "A complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), where \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\) and both A and B are complex matrices. The system is further analyzed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf we examine the system at t = 0 with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) and allow it to evolve according to \\\\( L \\\\) without any other intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be affected by changing the matrix B?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the matrix B directly alters the differential equation, thus modifying the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Laplace transform integrates this evolving function over time, any changes in B affect the entire form of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
