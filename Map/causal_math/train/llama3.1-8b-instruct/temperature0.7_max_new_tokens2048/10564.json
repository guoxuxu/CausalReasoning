  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine if any additional terms like \\\\( e^{ht} \\\\) were added based on the observed \\\\( L(z) \\\\) at some time T?",
  "Explanation": "While the presence of additional terms affects the Laplace transform, identifying the specific type of additional functions like \\\\( e^{ht} \\\\) or others from \\\\( L(z) \\\\), which would typically be a sum of terms like \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-k} + ... \\\\), is inconclusive without further information about the characteristic parameters of each additional term. The overlap in potential transformations makes exact identification challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
