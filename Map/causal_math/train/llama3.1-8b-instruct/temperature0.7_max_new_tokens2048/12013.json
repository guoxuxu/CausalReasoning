  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function f(z) in the complex plane, where \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) and k is a real constant. We explore the implications of modifying this function via a linear transformation \\( T(z) = az + b \\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nGiven the resulting function after combinations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at some point \\\\( z \\\\), can we determine whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied first without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the sequence of transformations applied solely from the final function value is generally impossible without extra information, due to distinct actions of the transformations depending on their order, indicating a critical role of order in complex transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
