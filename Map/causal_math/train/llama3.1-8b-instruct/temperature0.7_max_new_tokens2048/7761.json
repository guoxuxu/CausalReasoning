  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is analytically mapped using a Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\), at t = T, match the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Mobius transformation changes the initial conditions by potentially moving the position of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane. Since \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) rotates about the origin, the trajectory will differ unless \\\\( f \\\\) specifically maps \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to itself, which generally isn't the case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
