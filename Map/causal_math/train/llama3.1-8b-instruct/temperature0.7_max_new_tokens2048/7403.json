  "Problem": "Consider the response of an electrical system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a matrix describing the system dynamics. The system undergoes a transformation with \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{-Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. The transformations impact the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through a function \\\\( j(x) = K e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where K and F are constant matrices) is applied, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on C, D, K, or F?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( j(x) \\\\) during the system's evolution introduces entirely new dynamics with matrices K and F, alongside C and D from the initial transformation. These elements collectively alter the trajectory, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend on all these matrices and their interaction with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
