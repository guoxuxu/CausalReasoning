  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) governing a field \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) across space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = L u\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. We analyze the behavior of the field under the transformation \\\\(v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)]\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) involves applying an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the field \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we definitively determine the original field \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of transformation \\\\(T\\\\), and its affective properties, the original state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered from \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\). The transformation could have manipulated the initial condition in such a way that is not reversible just with the knowledge of the evolved state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
