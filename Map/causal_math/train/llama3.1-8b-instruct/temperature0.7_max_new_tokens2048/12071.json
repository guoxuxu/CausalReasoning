  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a linear operator in a complex function space, and \\\\( x \\\\) is an initial complex function. We explore the impacts of a Laplace transform intervention defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), analyzing its interactions over various scenarios.\n\nKnowing the result of a Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a point s, can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( x \\\\), the initial function, and affirm whether any intervention, specifically the use of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and the operation of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) change the function in a way that generally obscures the underlying original function \\\\( x \\\\). The transformation to the s-domain masks the specifics of temporal evolution and A's influence, thereby precluding definitive inferences about \\\\( x \\\\) or the exact interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
