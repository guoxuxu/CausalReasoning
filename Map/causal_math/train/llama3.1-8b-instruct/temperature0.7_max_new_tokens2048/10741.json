  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) on a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This leads to a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). The operation is analyzed in the context of the Laplace transform domain, where both functions are transformed and then manipulated algebraically.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without further processing or filtering, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), exhibit characteristics solely derived from \\\\( X(s) \\\\), the transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) in the time domain corresponds to a frequency shift in the Laplace transform domain. This alteration means \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) will not just exhibit characteristics derived from \\\\( X(s) \\\\), but will also incorporate effects due to the frequency shifting property of the exponential factor, effectively modifying the original spectrum of \\\\( X(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
