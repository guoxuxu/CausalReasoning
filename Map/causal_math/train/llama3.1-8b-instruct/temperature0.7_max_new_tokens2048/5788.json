  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor of capacitance C, a resistor of resistance R, and a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t}. Using complex impedance for the circuit analysis, examine the effects of an intervention by introducing an inductor with inductance L midway through an observation period.\n\nGiven the measurement of the steady-state current I(T) after intervening by introducing an inductor, can the values of all reactive components (C and L) be precisely determined just from this end data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the values of C and L from the steady-state current alone is challenging due to the intertwined effects of their reactances on the total impedance. Different combinations of L and C can produce similar current responses, making it impossible to uniquely identify their values without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
