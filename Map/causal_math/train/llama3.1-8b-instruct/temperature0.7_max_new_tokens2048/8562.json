  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a given contour in the complex plane and z is a complex variable. We explore the effect of the contour shift defined by \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) which results from the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t + i \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real number.\n\nCan we deduce the original contour \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) after computing \\\\( F(z) \\\\) along contour \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) without knowing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation due to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the integration pathway, and without prior knowledge of the intervention, the original contour \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) can't be conclusively inferred from the new functional outcome \\\\( F(z) \\\\) along \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\), due to the multiplicity of potential transformations leading to similar endpoints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
