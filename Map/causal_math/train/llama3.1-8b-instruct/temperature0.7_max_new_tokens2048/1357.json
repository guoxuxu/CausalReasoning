  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. The function describes a circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) on this periodic function.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is Laplace transformed, will the nature of the function as periodic in the time domain be preserved in the s-domain after transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a time-domain periodic function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) converts it into a function of complex frequency s, resulting in a rational function rather than a periodic function, hence not preserving the periodic nature in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
