  "Problem": "We study a vector field \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by two processes: multiplication by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iwt}z \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) applied over time. We aim to understand how these transformations impact \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\)), an intervention applies another complex function \\\\( j(z) = e^{-iwt}z \\\\), will the final result of \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) depend solely on the intervention and not on the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) partially counteracts the effect of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), but does not wholly negate its impact due to potential residual effects between time intervals. The final state \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) depends on both the initial and intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
