  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) that solves the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz(t) + Q\\\\) with the initial condition \\\\(z(0) = z_0\\\\), where P is a constant matrix and Q a constant vector. We explore the impact of applying a Laplace transform to both sides of this equation.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we deduce the original Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(0)\\\\}\\\\) of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before it was transformed back to the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "As the forward and inverse Laplace transforms are unique and reversible operations, given \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\), we can correctly compute \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(0)\\\\}\\\\), the Laplace transform of the initial condition, by applying the Laplace transform to the known time-domain function and using the properties of the transform with respect to initial conditions.",
