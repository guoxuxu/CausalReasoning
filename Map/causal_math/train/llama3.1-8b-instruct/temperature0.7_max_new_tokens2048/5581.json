  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real numbers and represent the real and imaginary components of the exponent, respectively. The transformation is studied in the context of its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined at t = 0 and subsequently allowed to evolve naturally without any external manipulation, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) has a Fourier Transform that is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\). Since \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) does not equal \\\\( B \\\\) assuming \\\\( A \\\\neq B \\\\), the Fourier Transform at \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\) is not affected directly by the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under its defined conditions without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
