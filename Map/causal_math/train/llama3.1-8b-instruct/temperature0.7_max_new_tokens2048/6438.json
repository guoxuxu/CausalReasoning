  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied, the additional heat from \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) might have changed the initial conditions in ways that cannot be traced back uniquely due to the dynamic nature of heat diffusion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
