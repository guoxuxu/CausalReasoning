  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system under a specific transformation, where \\( z(t) \\) represents a complex function of time \\( t \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), with \\( \\omega \\) constant. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is utilized to study the system's frequency domain characteristics.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we uniquely determine both the frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) of the original system \\( z(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides the frequency \\( \\omega \\) through the location of the pole; however, the magnitude and phase of \\( z_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) alone without additional initial condition data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
