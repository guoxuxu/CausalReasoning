  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then allowed to resolve under the given differential equation without intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(f)(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be identical to directly transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) evolved to time \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the evolved system incorporates changes due to the differential equation's influence, shifting frequencies in the transformation. Due to the nature of the differential equation, which influences growth terms involving \\\\( iz \\\\), the transform of the function evolved over time differs from the original transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
