  "Problem": "Analyze the stability and behavior of a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation in the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\vec{u}\\\\) is the fluid velocity, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity. Consider the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{u}(t))\\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nGiven an observed transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\) at some \\\\(s\\\\), can we conclusively determine the external interventions, such as the addition of force \\\\(\\\\vec{f}\\\\), without knowing the system's initial specifications like viscosity or initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap and interaction between how initial conditions, viscosity, and external forces affect the Laplace transform of the field make it impossible to uniquely attribute observed characteristics to specific interventions without full knowledge of the initial system parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
