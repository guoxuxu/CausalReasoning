  "Problem": "Consider a function on a complex plane governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^{2} \\\\) affects the output when applied at different instances.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( f(z(T)) = e^{z(T)} \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) and knowing the transformations used, can we uniquely determine the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential function on the complex plane is periodic and not injective, meaning multiple values of \\\\( z \\\\) might map to the same value of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\). Without knowing the specific transformations applied at each time or the order, we cannot uniquely backtrack to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
