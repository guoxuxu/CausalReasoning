  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix and x is a constant complex vector, under the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies A to a new matrix B (i.e., changing the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{Bt}x \\\\)) at time t_1, will the Laplace transform at any s depend solely on B and not on the earlier matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t_1 onwards will reflect the dynamics imposed by B, but the state's history influenced by A up to t_1 also impacts the overall transform, thereby making it dependent on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
