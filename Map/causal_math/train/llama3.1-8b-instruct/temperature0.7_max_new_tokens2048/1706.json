  "Problem": "Examine the calculation of the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( u(t) = t^2 \\\\) which is then convolved with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t} \\\\). The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transformation used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems responses.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the forms of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from the Laplace transform of their convolution if we know it was derived from such a convolution?",
  "Explanation": "Even if we know the Laplace transform of the convolution, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) just from the resulting transform due to the convolution theorem. Multiple different function pairs could result in the same transform due to the nature of product formation in the transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
