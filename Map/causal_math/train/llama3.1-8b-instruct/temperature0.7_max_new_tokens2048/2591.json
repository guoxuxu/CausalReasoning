  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where L is a linear operator and z_0 is an initial complex number. We explore the behavior involving an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Kt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where K is another linear operator.\n\nIf another operator, say \\\\( M \\\\), intervenes at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with a transformation like \\\\( g(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), and we then compute \\\\( f(z) \\\\) till time T, would the result only depend on operator L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics via M, making the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) dependent not just on L, but significantly on both K and M. The interplay between these operators during the operations entirely modifies the trajectory and eventual outcome after the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
