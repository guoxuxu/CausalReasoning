  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. To analyze the transformations, we introduce the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to a different function resulting from the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( L[f(t)] \\\\) is applied to the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) calculated at \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the transformed outcome be independent of the initial application of \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) defines the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to which the Laplace transform is applied, resulting in an outcome dependent on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the constant \\\\( a \\\\). The chosen \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\)'s value will have a significant impact on the Laplace transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
