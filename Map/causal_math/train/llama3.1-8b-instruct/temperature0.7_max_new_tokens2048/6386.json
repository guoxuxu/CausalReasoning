  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\). We explore the effect of a boundary condition transformation, where the transformation is represented by \\\\(g(s) = e^{\\\\lambda s}\\\\) applied along the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial D\\\\).\n\nGiven a solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) in \\\\(D\\\\) that satisfies the Laplace equation, can we determine whether the boundary condition \\\\(g(s)\\\\) was applied without knowing the original boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple boundary conditions could lead to solutions satisfying the Laplace equation; the equation's nature allows for multiple boundary conditions yielding the same or different solution profiles. Without specific knowledge of the initial boundary conditions, it's not possible to assert if \\\\(g(s)\\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
