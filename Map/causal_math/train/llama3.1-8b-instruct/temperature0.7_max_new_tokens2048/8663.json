  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) evolving over time \\( t \\) with \\( \\omega \\) a real constant. An operation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( z'(t) = \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) = z(t) + ce^{dt} \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants.\n\nIf the function is further modified at time \\( t_1 < T \\) by another transformation \\( \\mathcal{U}(z) = e^{at}z \\), with \\( a \\) a constant, will the system at \\( T \\) reflect changes due solely to \\( \\omega \\) independent of \\( a \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{U}(z) \\) means that \\( z'(t) \\) is now influenced by additional exponential scaling from \\( e^{at} \\), making the final state \\( z'(T) \\) dependent on \\( \\omega, a, c, \\) and \\( d \\). The effect at \\( T \\) clearly depends on all parameters, not just on \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
