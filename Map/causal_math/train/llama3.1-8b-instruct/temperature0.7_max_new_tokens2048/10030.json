  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied to a complex plane transformation, and the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\). Evaluate the causal relationships regarding the modulation of the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and the effect on the integral \\\\( I(z) \\\\).\n\nKnowing that \\\\( I(z) = 0 \\\\), can we infer a precise value of \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( I(z) = 0 \\\\) can occur for any value of \\\\( w \\\\) as long as \\\\( T \\\\) matches a multiple of the function's period (effects of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\)). Hence, \\\\( w \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the integral alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
