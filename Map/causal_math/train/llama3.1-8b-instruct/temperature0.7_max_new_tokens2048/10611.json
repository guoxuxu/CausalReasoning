  "Problem": "Consider a system where a matrix function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dx} = M u(x) \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix. We also look into the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{Nx} u(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention involves changing \\\\( M \\\\) to a new matrix \\\\( M' \\\\) at some \\\\( x_1 \\\\), will \\\\( T(u) \\\\) computed from \\\\( x = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( x = X \\\\) remain unchanged only due to the original matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and not \\\\( M' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( M' \\\\) during evolution impacts how \\\\( u(x) \\\\) evolves from \\\\( x_1 \\\\) onward, thereby affecting the integral in \\\\( T(u) \\\\). This change alters the resultant transformation, making it sensitive to both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( M' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
