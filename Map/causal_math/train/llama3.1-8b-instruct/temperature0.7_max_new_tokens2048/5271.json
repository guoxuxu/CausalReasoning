  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to this function. The Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nSuppose a function transformation \\\\( u(t) = t^2 z(t) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then it is subjected to Laplace transformation. Will the resultant transformation only depend on the original \\\\( w \\\\) irrespective of the new function \\\\( t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( u(t) = t^2 z(t) \\\\) modifies the function before taking the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) will yield a result that involves both \\\\( w \\\\) and additional terms due to the \\\\( t^2 \\\\) factor, specifically altering the dependence on \\\\( s \\\\) and creating a more complex expression involving both \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\).",
