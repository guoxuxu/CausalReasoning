  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by a complex function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed by another function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is some finite time.\n\nObtaining the final transformed output \\\\( h(z') \\\\), can we determine precisely which parameters were modified (\\\\( w \\\\), \\\\( u \\\\), or both) only by analyzing \\\\( h(z') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( h(z') \\\\) results from the integration of a complex function influenced by multiple exponential factors, whose effects are convoluted and entangled. Identifying specific parameter modifications solely from the final output is not feasible without additional information about the behavior of other parameters during the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
