  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k > 0 \\\\) is a constant. Analyses include transforming the function via \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nObserving the state of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), the original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the state at time T. The presence of the transformation introduces uncertainty in reconstructing the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
