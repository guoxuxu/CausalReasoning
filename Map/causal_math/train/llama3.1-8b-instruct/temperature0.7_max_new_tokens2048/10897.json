  "Problem": "Consider a complex mapping scenario given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, over the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is evaluated at this new point without further intervention, will \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\) shifts the point in the complex plane, and since \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is not a periodic function except along the imaginary axis, the outcome of \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = e^{z_0 + a} \\\\) will generally differ except in special cases where \\\\( a \\\\) is purely imaginary and a multiple of \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
