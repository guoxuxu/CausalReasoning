  "Problem": "Analyze the role of the Laplace transform in a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t + Au = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator. We consider the application of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and explore the repercussions on the system's response over time.\n\nIf an additional operator \\\\( B \\\\) is applied as an intervention to the transformed system such that the PDE changes to \\\\( u_t + Bu = 0 \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the steady state of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new operator \\\\( B \\\\) modifies the dynamics of the system, altering how the system approaches its steady state. Therefore, the characteristics of the steady state will now depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), rather than solely on \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
