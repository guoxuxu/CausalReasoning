  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function is evaluated and then transformed using the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). The system's behavior over the complex plane is considered under this transformation.\n\nWill the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane exhibit the same characteristics as the transformation of \\\\( e^{Az_0} \\\\) directly calculated without initially applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) results in a transformation that incorporates the influences of all complex exponential components within \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\). Directly calculating \\\\( e^{Az_0} \\\\) and then applying the Fourier transform does not account for the influence of \\\\( A \\\\) over the entire plane, leading to results that exhibit different properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
