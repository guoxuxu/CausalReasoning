  "Problem": "Consider the system of complex functions defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is iterated over time t, generating a sequence in the complex plane that can exhibit dynamics typical of the Julia set. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix, on this sequence.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{sB}z ds \\\\) (where B is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the sequence at t = T for T > t_1 be independent of the transformations applied by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) involve different matrix exponentials that modify the trajectory of the sequence in non-trivial ways. The state of the sequence at any given t = T > t_1 will depend on the specifics of both A and B, as well as the nature of the iterative function \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Each transformation adds a level of complexity and alters the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
