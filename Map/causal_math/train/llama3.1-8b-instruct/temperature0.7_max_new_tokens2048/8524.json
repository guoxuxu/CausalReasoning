  "Problem": "Assume we are examining two parameterized functions, \\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\) and \\( g(w) = e^{\\lambda w} \\), where \\( c \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are complex numbers. We explore the effects of transformations involving these functions on the complex plane over parameter \\( t \\).\n\nGiven \\( g(w(T)) = e^{\\mu t_1(z^2+cz)+\\lambda(T-t_1)(z^2+cz)} \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\), can we definitively conclude the exact moments \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) were introduced or adjusted solely based on the final function expression without further information?",
  "Explanation": "While \\( g(w(T)) \\) demonstrates an exponential function dependent on both parameters \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\), the specific timing and sequence of changing from \\( \\lambda \\) to \\( \\mu \\) cannot be uniquely determined from the final form alone. Multiple combinations of \\( \\lambda, \\mu, \\) and intervention times could potentially yield the same end expression, introducing ambiguity in reconstructing the sequence or moments of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
