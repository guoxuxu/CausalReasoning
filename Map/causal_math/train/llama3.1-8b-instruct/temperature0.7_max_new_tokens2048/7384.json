  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions, expressed as \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a potential function. An external spatial transformation is defined by \\\\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven that the post-transformed and intervened system \\\\(u(h(x, y)) + k\\\\) satisfies the Laplace equation, can we deduce which intervention (transformation or addition of k) occurred first?",
  "Explanation": "Since both the transformation and the addition of a constant would retain the property of being solutions to the Laplace equation regardless of their sequence, it is impossible to determine from the final form of \\\\(u(h(x, y)) + k\\\\) alone which intervention happened first. The commutativity of these operations with respect to the Laplace equation conceals their order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
