  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function perturbation \\\\( g(x) = x - c \\\\) is introduced, will the resulting integral \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 reflect only the influence of the function transformations or include the effects of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( g(x) \\\\) reintroduces \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to its original form after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but the accumulated effects from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) due to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) still impact the integral. Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects both the perturbations and the inherent properties of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
