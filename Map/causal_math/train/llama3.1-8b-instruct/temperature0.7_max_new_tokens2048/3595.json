  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\), where f(t) is an original function in the time domain. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\\\) where k is a non-negative integer, and the implication of such transformations on the resulting function in the complex s-domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies k to a new value \\\\( k' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) \\\\) strictly depend only on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change from k to \\\\( k' \\\\) merely alters how the time function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is weighted by time, affecting subsequent derivatives in the s-domain. Thus, the end result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) \\\\) strictly depends on the nature of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and new value \\\\( k' \\\\), directly reflecting the altered order of differentiation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
