  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). The system is initially defined by the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). An external operation applies the transformation function \\\\( g(t) = t^3 \\\\) at some time t = 0.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), transforming it to \\\\( h(t) = g(t)f(t) = t^5 \\\\), and then \\\\( L(h)(s) \\\\) is computed without further intervention, will the result of the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at s = 1 be the same as that computed directly from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at s = 1?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation alters the function from \\\\( t^2 \\\\) to \\\\( t^5 \\\\), significantly changing the outcome of the integral in the Laplace transform. Specifically, Laplace transform of \\\\( t^5 \\\\) differs from that of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) due to different powers of t contributing differently under the integration against \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\). This leads to different results for \\\\( s = 1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
