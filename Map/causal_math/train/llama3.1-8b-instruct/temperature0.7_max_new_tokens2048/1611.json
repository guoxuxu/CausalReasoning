  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), yielding a new function defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the functional relation \\\\( s \\\\) as it affects the behavior of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) over the complex s-plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\), a scaling function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) is applied to the output of the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{t} \\\\), will \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) be independent of the parameter used in the exponential function \\\\( e^{t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) not only modifies the input to the Laplace transform but also affects how the parameters of the exponential function influence the transformed function. Specifically, scaling by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) impacts the Laplace domain outcome, adding additional poles and affecting its convergence, causing it to now depend on how \\\\( t \\\\) scales the exponential growth of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
