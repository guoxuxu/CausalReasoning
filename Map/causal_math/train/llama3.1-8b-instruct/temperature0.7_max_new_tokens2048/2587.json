  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf an intervention modifies z(t) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 < t_1 < T \\\\) by applying a transformation such that \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\) for \\\\( t_1 \\\\leq t \\\\leq T \\\\), will the calculation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from 0 to T yield a result that depends only on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during the interval \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), introducing a new frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Hence, the resulting integral \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), reflecting the influence of this new functional behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
