  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{−λt}(x + iy) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( λ \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed under the application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and time evolution t.\n\nCan we precisely reverse-engineer the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by solely observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing that \\\\( L \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the presence of complex constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( L \\\\), and the exponential factor involving \\\\( λ \\\\), reversing to obtain \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exactly is not feasible without explicit details of both the application of \\\\( L \\\\) and the exact time at which it was applied, in addition to the values of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( λ \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
