  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\), including their timings and specific parameters like C, can result in the same endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The overlap in potential effects from these transformations creates ambiguity, preventing an unequivocal inference of the interventions applied only from the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
