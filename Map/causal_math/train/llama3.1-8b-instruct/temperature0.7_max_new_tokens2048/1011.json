  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) modifying the function to \\\\( y(t) = e^{-t}e^{it} \\\\), will the Fourier Transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( y(t) \\\\) differ from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor transforms the function into a decaying exponential combined with a complex exponential, affecting the Fourier Transform significantly. The new transform will have its peak shifted and broadened, reflecting the decay introduced by \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
