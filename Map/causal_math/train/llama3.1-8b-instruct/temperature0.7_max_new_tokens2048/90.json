  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to it. We explore the effect of initial modifications and transformations onto the causal inference of the function's behavior over time.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform of the function at time T, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) at time t=0 without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform at a specific time provides information primarily about the exponential decay characteristics shaped by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the integrative effect over time. The initial phase \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) affects the overall function but is not uniquely recoverable from the Laplace transform alone without additional phase-specific details.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
