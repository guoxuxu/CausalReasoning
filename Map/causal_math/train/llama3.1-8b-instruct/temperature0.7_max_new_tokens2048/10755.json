  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied on the complex plane excludes zero and analyze its impact using a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2} \\\\) at some point in the domain, and then its Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed, will this new transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) still reflect the original properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the functional form and thus the nature of its singularities, resulting in a Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) that reflects the properties of \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2} \\\\), not the original \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\). This changes both the order of the pole and the behavior at infinity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
