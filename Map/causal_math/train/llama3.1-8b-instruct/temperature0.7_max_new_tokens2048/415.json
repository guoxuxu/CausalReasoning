  "Problem": "Consider a system following a complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sT} ds \\cdot x \\\\), where T is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. The function \\\\( g(z) = Uz \\\\) is a unitary transformation applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where U is a constant unitary matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) the unitary transformation \\\\( g(z) = Uz \\\\) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 uniquely depend on the initial state without being affected by the intervention—assuming no other information about T or U is given?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a unitary transformation modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by applying the transformation U which alters its course regardless of the initial conditions set by x, impacting the final state at any T > t_1.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The unitary transformation g at time t1 and the constant matrix T determine the value of z(T) for T > t1, while the constant vector x does not influence z(T) uniquely."
