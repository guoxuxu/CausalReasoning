  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing application where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( X(f) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). The transformed signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by a frequency response \\\\( H(f) \\\\). We are particularly interested in the impact of modifying the signal processing steps with the inclusion of an inverse Fourier transform defined by \\\\( x'(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\{X'(f)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified signal \\\\( x'(t) \\\\), can we infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowledge about \\\\( H(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( H(f) \\\\), it is impossible to correctly reverse the effects signified by \\\\( X'(f) = H(f) \\\\cdot X(f) \\\\). The modification by \\\\( H(f) \\\\) could fundamentally alter certain frequencies making it impossible to unambiguously reconstruct \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) without this information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
