  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and later evaluation at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without any other intervention result in the same output as if the transformation was not applied at all?",
  "Explanation": "When applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), the function is fundamentally altered to \\\\( e^{i\\omega}e^{\\lambda z} = e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)z} \\\\. The result depends on the values of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), demonstrating that the frequency modulation changes the system's behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
