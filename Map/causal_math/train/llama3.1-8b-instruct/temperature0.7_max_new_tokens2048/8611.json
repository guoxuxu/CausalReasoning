  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis scenario where we study the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the effects of performing an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf, at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a Laplace transformation is applied as an intervention on \\\\( w(z) \\\\), will the resulting function at a later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and not on \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform as an intervention alters the course of evolution of the function. The end state after time \\\\( T \\\\) will not only depend on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) but also significantly on the nature of transformation introduced during \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing its contributions more complexly than merely tracking exponential growth.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
