  "Problem": "Consider a complex integration scenario described by a contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) around a closed path C in the complex plane, where \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to analyze the integral in terms of real time dynamics.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies the integral path from C to a new path D while keeping \\\\(a\\\\) constant during the transformation period, will the final integral value depend only on the original function form, ignoring the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that changes the contour path from C to D directly influences the result of the integral by altering which singularities are enclosed by the path, impacting the sum of residues considered. This change will result in a dependency on both the function's original form and the new path D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → f(z); f(z) → C; C → contour integral; intervention → modification of C; modification of C → new path D; new path D → final integral value; f(z) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → real time dynamics; real time dynamics → final integral value"
