  "Problem": "Analyzing a system driven by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where k is a wave speed constant. The influence of a transformation characterized by \\\\( T(u) = u e^{-ikx} \\\\) is tested, which can affect how solutions are represented in the complex domain.\n\nGiven the observed outcome \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t > 0 \\\\), can we infer the initial application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) accurately without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) might be indistinguishable from initial conditions that could naturally evolve to the same \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), especially without explicit knowledge about phase shifts or the initial application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation (T(u)) → Change in representation; PDE → u(x,t); u(x,t) → T(u); T(u) → Change in representation; Transformation (T(u)) → T(u)"
