  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to determine if the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from a phase shift or purely from the original dynamics. The lack of information on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) prevents uniquely reversing the effect back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
