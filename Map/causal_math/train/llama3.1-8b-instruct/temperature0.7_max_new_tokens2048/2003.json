  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the matrix \\( M \\) to \\( N \\) at some point and then \\( g(z) \\) is applied, will the function \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) still only depend on the original matrix \\( M \\) and not \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the matrix from \\( M \\) to \\( N \\) represents a new transformation \\( f'(z) = Nz \\) which, when applied before \\( g(z) \\), results in a different value due to \\( g(f'(z_0)) = e^{iNz_0} \\). As such, the outcome will depend on both \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), affecting the ultimate behavior of the exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
