  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) applied at different points in time and its implications under the dynamics governed by matrix \\\\( A \\\\).\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we specify which transformations among \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or neither were applied, solely based on the end state?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations due to non-distinctive influences of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) on the trajectory. The possible overlapping effects of these transformations render it impossible to clearly identify which modifications were applied based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
