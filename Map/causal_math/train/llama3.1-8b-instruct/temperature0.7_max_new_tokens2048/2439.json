  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nIf at a certain point \\( t_1 \\), an intervention via a scaling matrix \\( V \\) (another diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied to the system, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) be representative only of the initial application \\( T \\) and not \\( V \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with scaling matrix \\( V \\) further alters the state of the system. The resultant state at time \\( T \\) depends on both the initial transformation by \\( U \\) and the later application of \\( V \\), thus reflecting the effects of both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
