  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field V(x) and analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax + b \\\\) where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We study the particle's motion in different cases with and without transformations using the operator \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\), where L is the Liouville operator for the system.\n\nGiven the particle's position at time T, is it possible to determine precisely which transformations were applied (\\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both) during its motion, just by computing backwards from the final position?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-reversible nature of general transformations in Hamiltonian mechanics and their potential to influence each other's effect, it is typically not possible to conclusively ascertain the history of transformations just by the endpoint. Multiple transformation sequences might lead to the same or indistinguishably close final positions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Particle position at time T → final position; Transformation T(x) or S(x) → particle position at time T; Liouville operator → particle position at time T; Position at time 0 → particle position at time T; Transformation T(x) or S(x) → Liouville operator; Transformation T(x) or S(x) → particle position at time 0; Particle position at time 0 → Transformation T(x) or S(x)"
