  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), applied to complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representable by a series of sinusoids. The analysis explores the effects of modifying the function through an additive constant term, represented by \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nBased solely on knowledge of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can you reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional conditions or information?",
  "Explanation": "Even though Laplace transforms are theoretically invertible, practical recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) requires additional information such as initial conditions, domain specifications, or constraints on the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Loss of information about transients or discontinuities in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is also a critical factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
