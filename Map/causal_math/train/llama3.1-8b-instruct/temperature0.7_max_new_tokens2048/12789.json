  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We study the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Ce^{Bt}z \\\\), where B and C are also complex matrices.\n\nBy observing the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exactly, without information about whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible application of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which compounds effects of matrices C and B, makes it impossible to precisely deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the possibility of their influence is unknown. The exponential and complex nature of B and C can obscure or alter initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
