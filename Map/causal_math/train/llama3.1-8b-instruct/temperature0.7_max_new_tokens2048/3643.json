  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( h(u) = u + \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat equation's constant k and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the system's state again, making the final temperature distribution dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and k. The superposition of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\cos(\\\\beta x) \\\\) along with the heat diffusion governed by k results in complex interactions affecting the final state at any time T > t_1.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
