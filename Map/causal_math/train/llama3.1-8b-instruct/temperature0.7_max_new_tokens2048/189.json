  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) series circuit driven by a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V0 * sin(ωt). The relationship between the input voltage and current is governed by the differential equation L*d^2I/dt^2 + R*dI/dt + (1/C)*I = dV/dt, where I is the current, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nIf the input voltage V(t) is changed from V0 * sin(ωt) to V0 * cos(ωt) without altering any parameters (R, L, C), does this change the steady state current response in terms of phase shift or amplitude?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the input voltage from a sine to a cosine function alters the phase of the driving voltage relative to the original configuration. As the differential equation constitutes a linear system, the change in input signal directly affects the steady state solution's phase, typically shifting it by π/2, affecting both the phase and the potential amplitude response due to impedance variations at different phases.",
