  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = A x + B u\\\\), with A being the system matrix and B the input matrix. The input \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of time and defined by an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) x(s) ds \\\\), where K is a kernel matrix function.\n\nCan we definitively ascertain what changes were made to the kernel matrix function \\\\( K(s) \\\\), based only on the observed final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), knowing that an intervention occurred at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific alterations made to \\\\( K(s) \\\\) or pinpointing when these changes occurred during the interval [0, T] based solely on \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is infeasible. Multiple configurations of \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and its intervention with \\\\( L(s) \\\\) can lead to the same final state, obscuring the exact nature of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
