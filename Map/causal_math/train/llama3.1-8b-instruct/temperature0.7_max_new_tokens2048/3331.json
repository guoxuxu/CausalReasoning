  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a complex number matrix and z is a complex variable. The function is applied in a system undergoing transformation by a linear operator represented by matrix B. We evaluate the relationship between the application of complex function and how the system evolves over time.\n\nIf an intervention using another complex function \\\\(g(z) = e^{Cz}\\\\) (where C is another complex matrix) is applied at a certain point \\\\(z_1\\\\) post initial application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\), will the final state at \\\\(z = Z\\\\) exclusively depend on B and not on A or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces another modifying factor in addition to initial \\\\(f(z)\\\\), making the state at \\\\(Z\\\\) dependent on all three matrices A, B, C. The cumulative effects of these nonlinear transformations dictate the trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
