  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where L is a linear operator and z_0 is an initial complex number. We explore the behavior involving an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Kt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where K is another linear operator.\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is calculated starting from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and progresses up to time T without any intervention, would the transformed output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T remain purely dependent on the initial linear operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) will be influenced by both the operators L and K, as the transformation incorporates \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\), which modifies the integrand and thus impacts the result, diverging from a trajectory purely determined by L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
