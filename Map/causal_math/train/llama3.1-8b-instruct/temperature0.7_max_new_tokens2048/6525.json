  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of t. The Laplace Transform of z is defined as \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Consider the impact of the differential operator D on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( Dz(t) = z'(t) \\\\) and its effect on the transformed function.\n\nIf the differential operator D is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) followed by the Laplace Transform, is the result equivalent to applying the Laplace Transform first and then multiplying by s in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the Laplace Transform states that \\\\( L(Dz(t)) = L(z'(t)) = sL(z)(s) - z(0) \\\\). Hence, applying D to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then transforming yields an equivalent result to transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) first and then employing the multiplication by s, given that \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is initially known.",
