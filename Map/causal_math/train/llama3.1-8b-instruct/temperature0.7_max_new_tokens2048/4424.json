  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf we only know the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations or their sequences merely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the overlapping nature of effects caused by the integral transformations. Each transformation modifies the system state in ways that are dependent on the system's responses to earlier states, making it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
