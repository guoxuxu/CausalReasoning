  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) over time t, where P is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a constant matrix) is applied, will the resulting value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on Q and not on P or R?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the intervention via \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) introduces additional complexity into the system, making the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of influences from Q, P, and R. Both the pre and post intervention transformations have a significant impact on the final state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
