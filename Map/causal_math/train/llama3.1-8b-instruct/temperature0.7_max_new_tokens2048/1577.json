  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\) where c is a complex number. We analyze the impact of integral transformations using the Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). Let's examine the transformations with and without interventions on the function and its reverse causality.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t = z \\\\) (a complex number), and we only manipulate \\\\( f \\\\) via the variable \\\\( t \\\\), will the output at s = S be different after altering the parameter c in \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing c directly alters the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 + ct \\\\). Therefore, the Laplace Transform, which depends heavily on the function's form, will yield different results for different values of c, as the behavior under the integral transformation changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
