  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) = \\\\hat{u}(t, k)\\\\) and its inverse across variable transformations.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the function \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at t = 0 and evolved under the partial differential equation without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at t = T transform identically to if the function had been directly evolved to t = T under the same equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation and its inverse are linear and invertible operations that preserve the dynamics governed by the linear operator L when no further operations modify the function, thereby maintaining the system integrity throughout the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
