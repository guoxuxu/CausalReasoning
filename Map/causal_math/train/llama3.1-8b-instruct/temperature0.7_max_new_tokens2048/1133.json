  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is the initial function and allowed to pass through the Fourier transform without further intervention, will the resulting spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega' - \\\\omega) \\\\), which is non-zero exactly at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, at the frequency matching \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the spectrum is non-zero, indicative of the presence of that frequency component in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
