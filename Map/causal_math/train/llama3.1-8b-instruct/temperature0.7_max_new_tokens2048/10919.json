  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a time-varying two-dimensional system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant 2x2 matrix. We explore the consequence of intervention through a transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{Nt}z\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another constant 2x2 matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(k(z) = e^{Lt}z\\\\) (where \\\\(L\\\\) is a constant matrix) is intervened at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), does the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend solely on the dynamic matrix \\\\(M\\\\) and not on the transformations induced by \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\(k(z) = e^{Lt}z\\\\) imbues another layer of complexity into the state evolution, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) contingent not only on the original dynamics characterized by \\\\(M\\\\) but also significantly affected by the transformations \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\). The influences from the exponential terms due to matrices \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) modify the pathway and can result in different endpoints.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
