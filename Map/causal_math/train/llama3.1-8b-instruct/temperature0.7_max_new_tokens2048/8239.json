  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx + Nu \\\\), with M and N as constant matrices representing the system dynamics and control input respectively. We consider the role of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = k^Tx \\\\) applied at different times, where k is a constant matrix and T denotes the transpose.\n\nIf at time t_1 a control input \\\\( u = v \\\\) (where v is a constant vector) is introduced and the system continues to evolve under \\\\( dx/dt = Mx + Nu \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or the control input N?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the control input changes the system dynamics by adding \\\\( Nu \\\\), and if the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) altered the initial state, both factors will influence the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The system's trajectory toward \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is contingent on the specifics of M, N, and any initial state modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
