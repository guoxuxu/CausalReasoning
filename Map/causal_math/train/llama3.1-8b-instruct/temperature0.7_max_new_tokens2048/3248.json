  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. This function models a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane over time t. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function and then examining the implications of manipulations in the frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine precisely which frequencies were present before a selective filtering intervention was applied, based solely on the output from an inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "After interventions that modify the frequency spectrum (such as selective filtering), the resulting time-domain function loses information about any frequencies that were removed. It's thus impossible to uniquely determine the original frequency components that were present before the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
