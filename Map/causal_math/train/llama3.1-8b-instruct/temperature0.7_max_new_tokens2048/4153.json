  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and B is the control input matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation of the states defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and no control inputs are applied thereafter (i.e., \\\\( u(t) = 0 \\\\)), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be solely influenced by D with the initial state modified by \\\\( T(x_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) which involves integration modified by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) will change how the state evolves over time relative to just being influenced by D alone. The effects of M on the trajectory through the transformation integral need to be considered in addition to D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
