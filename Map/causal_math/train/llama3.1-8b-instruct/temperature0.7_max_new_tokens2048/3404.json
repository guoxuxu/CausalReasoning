  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at time T, can the exact nature of any intermediate intervention (like the multiplication by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at t' < T) be determined uniquely, just by knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) gives insight into the modified state at T, multiple forms of interventions or different functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) could lead to the same or similar transforms at T. Thus, it is not possible to uniquely identify all characteristics of the interventions solely from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
