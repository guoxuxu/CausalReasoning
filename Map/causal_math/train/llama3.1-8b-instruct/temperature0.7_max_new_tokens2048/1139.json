  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nIf an additional transformation, say multiplication by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\\\), is applied before taking the Fourier transform, will the transform still show a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( e^{-ix} \\\\) before the Fourier transform effectively neutralizes the exponential term, resulting in the integrand becoming unity across all x. The Fourier transform of a constant function (like 1) distributes across all frequencies, thus not producing a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "function definition → function z(x); function z(x) → Fourier transform; multiplication by e^(-ix) → modified function; modified function → Fourier transform; modified Fourier transform → delta function"
