  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), with \\( M \\) being a complex matrix. Investigate how the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), affects the dynamics of \\( z(t) \\), where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( M \\) to \\( M' \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), and the Laplace Transform is reapplied, will the system's behavior at time \\( t = T \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be influenced by the original matrix \\( M \\) or just \\( M' \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will reflect the influence of both \\( M \\) and \\( M' \\). The initial segment evolves under \\( M \\) until \\( t_1 \\), and subsequent evolution follows \\( M' \\). Thus, both matrices collectively determine the state at \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
