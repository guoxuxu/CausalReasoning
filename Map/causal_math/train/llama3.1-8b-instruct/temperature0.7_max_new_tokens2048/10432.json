  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the role of the integral transformation \\\\(T(u) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} u(t) \\, dt\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(T(u)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely identify whether the transformation \\\\(V(u)\\\\) was applied, just by analyzing the resulting Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform \\\\(T(u)\\\\) may result from a variety of possible transformations and original functions, compounded by the linear transformation of the system under \\\\(L\\\\). The effects of \\\\(V(u)\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) on \\\\(u(t)\\\\)'s dynamics will generally not be distinguishable solely through observing the final \\\\(T(u)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
