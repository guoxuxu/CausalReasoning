  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), in a system governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 2u = 0 \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the modified system when a transformation function \\\\( f(u) = \\\\sin(t)u \\\\) is applied.\n\nGiven the transformed Laplace transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) at s = 1, can we determine precisely what interventions (\\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) were applied, relying only on the transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations due to \\\\( f(u) = \\\\sin(t)u \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) = e^{ct}u \\\\) may lead to overlap in the effects and characteristics within the Laplace domain. Various combinations and timings of these transformations can yield similar final states, creating ambiguity and making it impossible to pinpoint the specific interventions used solely from the Laplace transform result at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
