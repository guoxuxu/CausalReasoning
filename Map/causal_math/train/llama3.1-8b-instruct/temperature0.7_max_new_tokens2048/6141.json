  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is a nonlinear function, representing a closed system. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t{e^{At}F(z) dt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T match the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G(z) \\\\) alters the initial state by integrating a transformed version of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), which fundamentally changes the trajectory because of the effect of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and the integral. Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is different unless \\\\( A \\\\) is the zero matrix making \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) trivial.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
