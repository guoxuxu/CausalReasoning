  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\). We study the effect of transformations \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) and their inverse on the function, along with an external forcive change in variable using the transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\)'s calculated value at the endpoint, can we determine precisely which transformations (if either \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\), \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\), or both) were originally applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of quadratic forms in \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\) and potential compound effects from applying both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( h \\\\), multiple sequences of transformations can yield the same endpoint in \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\). This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely identify the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
