  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect the effects on the function when it is subjected to a Fourier transformation, given by \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly subjected to a Fourier transformation, will the resulting function \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) \\\\) be equivalent to \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) specifically when \\( \\xi = \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) results in a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\). Hence, the value of \\( F(z)(\\xi) \\) is non-zero only when \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), demonstrating the pure frequency component of the original function corresponding to its intrinsic frequency \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
