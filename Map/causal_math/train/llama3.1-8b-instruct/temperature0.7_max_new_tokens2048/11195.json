  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = Y(s)\\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is the original time function. To examine any causal changes, an impulse response function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(y(t)\\\\) resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = h(t) * y(t)\\\\). The frequency responses of \\\\(h\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are denoted by \\\\(H(s)\\\\) and \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), respectively.\n\nIf during the system's function another impulse response function \\\\(k(t)\\\\) is applied at a time \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), influencing the ongoing convolution, will \\\\(G(s)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t = T > t_1\\\\) still purely represent the product \\\\(H(s)Y(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new impulse response \\\\(k(t)\\\\) alters the system dynamics post \\\\(t_1\\\\), introducing an additional convolution factor. The Laplace transform \\\\(G(s)\\\\) will now include the influence of \\\\(K(s)\\\\), the transform of \\\\(k(t)\\\\), making it represent a different product, not just \\\\(H(s)Y(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
