  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is a control matrix. An integral transformation with kernel K(x, s) is applied to the state x, yielding a transformed state \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(x(s), s) ds\\\\).\n\nIf the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) changes over time, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T necessarily reflect these changes in the control input?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on the evolution of the state variable x(t), which directly depends on the control input u(t) through the control system equation. Hence, changes in u(t) have a direct effect on z(T) via the state x(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
