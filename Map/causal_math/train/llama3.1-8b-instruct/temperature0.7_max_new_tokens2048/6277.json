  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The system's behavior is modified by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\), thus impacting the state trajectory. The new trajectory depends on both the structure of \\\\( F \\\\) relative to \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), leading to a fundamentally different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
