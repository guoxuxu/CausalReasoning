  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis setting where we analyze the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), denoted by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). We examine how the application of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which translates functions in time by a constant \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) affects the Laplace transform and its interpretation.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to create \\\\( h(t-a) \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\), and this new function is then Laplace transformed, is \\\\( H(s) \\\\) affected such that it differs from the original transform by a factor independent of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the translated function, \\\\( h(t-a) \\\\), is \\\\( e^{-as}H(s) \\\\). This result introduces a multiplication by \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), which definitively changes the Laplace transform in a way that depends solely on the translation parameter \\\\( a \\\\) and not on the specific form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Operator L → Translation by constant a; Translation by constant a → Function h(t-a); Function h(t-a) → Laplace transform H(s-a); Laplace transform H(s-a) → Factor independent of h(t); Operator L → Factor independent of h(t); Factor independent of h(t) → Difference from original transform H(s)"
