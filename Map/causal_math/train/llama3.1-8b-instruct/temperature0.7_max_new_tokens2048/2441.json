  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = AX + BU \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and U is a control input. We study the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Cs}X(s) ds \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on the behavior of the process.\n\nIf no interventions are applied, and the control input U remains constant, is the output of the transformation \\\\( T(X) \\\\) at time T solely determined by matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the transformation \\\\( T(X) \\\\) also depends on the matrix C and the integration process over time. The dynamics of X are shaped by A and B via the differential equation, but the integral transformation with C infuses additional dependency, which alters the cumulative effect observed at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
