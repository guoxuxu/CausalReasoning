  "Problem": "Analyze the heat distribution in a rod over time governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity coefficient. Consider an intervention where a heating element applies a periodic thermal function \\\\( p(x) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\) at a specific location along the rod.\n\nIf the initial heat distribution is set as \\\\( u(x,0) = \\\\sin(\\\\pi x) \\\\) and evolves under the heat equation without any other influences, will the heat distribution profile at a later time t be solely dependent on the initial function and thermal diffusivity k?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of external influences, the heat distribution over time will depend only on the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and the parameter k through the heat equation. Dispersal patterns will be determined entirely by diffusion according to the governing equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
