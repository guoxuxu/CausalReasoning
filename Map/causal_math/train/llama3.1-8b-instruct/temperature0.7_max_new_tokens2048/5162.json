  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We are also interested in the effect of a transformation represented by the operator \\\\( P(t) = e^{Mt} \\\\), with M being another constant operator. This transformation is applied to the initial condition prior to evolution under the system's dynamics.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) if we are uncertain whether the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking certainty on whether \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied obscures the initial condition, as \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) might have modified it in an unretraceable way, especially if M’s values obscure or alter the properties of L’s influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
