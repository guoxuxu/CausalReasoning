  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant linking \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and another independent real-valued function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\\\alpha y \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a positive decay constant. We analyze the impact of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( j(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), as well as \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The overall trajectory is influenced by the compounded effects of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
