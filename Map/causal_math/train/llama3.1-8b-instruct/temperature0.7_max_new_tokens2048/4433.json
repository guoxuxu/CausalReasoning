  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Evaluate the change in the function through an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is used to transform \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any alteration in parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), does the transformed function \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) reflect the same transformation as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly calculated at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) fundamentally alters the representation of the function, introducing an entirely different dependence on \\\\( t \\\\) across the entire interval from 0 to T, unlike the direct computation of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) at a specific point T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
