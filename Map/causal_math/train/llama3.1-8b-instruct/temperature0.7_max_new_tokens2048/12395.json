  "Problem": "Assume a system governs the motion of a particle along a path on the complex plane, given by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial position and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant complex frequency. We consider transformations of the path using a mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling parameter.\n\nCan the specific transformations applied (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) be uniquely determined by observing the position at time T, if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of complex exponential scalings and rotations, multiple combinations of parameters could yield the same endpoint. Thus, without additional information about the sequence or type of transformations, it is not feasible to precisely identify what interventions were applied during the evolution of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
