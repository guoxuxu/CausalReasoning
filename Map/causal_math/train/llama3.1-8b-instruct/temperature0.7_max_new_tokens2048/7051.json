  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention \\\\( k(z) = Ez \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where E is another constant matrix. Will the system's behavior at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by \\\\( D \\\\) and not \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( E \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional transformation \\\\( k(z) = Ez \\\\) alters the continual development of the system. The state at any time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) will reflect the combined effects of matrices C, E, and D. Therefore, the system's state is dependent on all the transformation matrices applied throughout its evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
