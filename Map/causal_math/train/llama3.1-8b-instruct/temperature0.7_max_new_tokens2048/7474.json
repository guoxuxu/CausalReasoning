  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\) with A and B being constant complex matrices. This scenario explores the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) under the linear transformations \\\\( T_x(x, y) = (x+1, y) \\\\) and \\\\( T_y(x, y) = (x, y+1) \\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we deduce the original values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) without knowing whether \\( T_x \\) or \\( T_y \\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation effects of \\( T_x \\) and \\( T_y \\), which shift \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) respectively by 1, result in new values at each step multiplied by \\( e^A \\) and \\( e^B \\). These transformations mask the original values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), making it impossible to uniquely determine them from \\( z(t) \\) alone at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
