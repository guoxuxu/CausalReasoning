  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. We introduce the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is another constant matrix, to study how this affects the trajectories over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which alters how the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\). Since \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) could change the vector's direction and magnitude, the system's trajectory will be different, resulting in a different vector at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
