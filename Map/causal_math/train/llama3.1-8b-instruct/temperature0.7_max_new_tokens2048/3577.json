  "Problem": "Consider a domain in the complex plane where we evaluate the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dt \\\\), with C being a contour in the complex plane. We explore the effect of varying the parameter z and modifying the contour C.\n\nIf the parameter z is changed from z0 to z1, and the contour C remains fixed, will the value of the transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) at z1 be the same as at z0?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter z in the exponential function \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) fundamentally changes the integrand, affecting the value of the integral over the contour C. Since \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\)'s behavior is highly sensitive to z, especially in terms of growth or decay rates along the contour, the integral result also changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
