  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where the output at any time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) is a complex function and A is a constant complex matrix. Consider the effect of an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( X(t) \\\\) as \\\\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) after control application \\\\( u(t) \\\\), is it feasible to determine the exact external control applied only from \\\\( Z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), it is not straightforward to trace back and uniquely identify the control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) due to the integration obscuring direct effects and the potential for various controls leading to similar or identical outcomes in combination with the original \\\\( X(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
