  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a real function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We explore the effects of initial conditions and transformations on the behavior of the transformed function over time.\n\nCan we specifically determine whether the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) was applied to \\\\( F(z) \\\\) after Laplace transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), only by observing the final form of \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed form of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) could result from various operations, not uniquely from the application of the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\). Without explicit information about the intermediary processes (such as application of \\\\( D \\\\) or other possible interventions), it’s not possible to attribute the observed characteristics of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) solely to a specific transformation sequence. The non-unique mapping from function characteristics to potential transformations complicates exact causal inference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
