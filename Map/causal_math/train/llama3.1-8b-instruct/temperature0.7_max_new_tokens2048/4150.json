  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on \\( z(t) \\), defined by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\).\n\nCan the original matrices A and B be uniquely determined by examining \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\) without additional information about how \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) were shaped initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\) provides information about the frequency content of \\( z(t) \\) but does not uniquely decode the individual contributions or specific forms of A and B unless further structural information about these matrices or initial conditions is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
