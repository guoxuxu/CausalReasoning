  "Problem": "Analyze causal inference in a system represented by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\lambda \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the system's state and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant speed. Additionally, consider the transformation \\\\( g(u) = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and the PDE evolves without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T be different from the system directly evolved from \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) = Lu \\\\) alters the initial condition from \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) to \\\\( Lu_0(x) \\\\). This transformation changes the solution of the PDE, causing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) to differ from the direct evolution of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The linear transformation will shift or scale the initial state, influencing the system's evolution under the PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
