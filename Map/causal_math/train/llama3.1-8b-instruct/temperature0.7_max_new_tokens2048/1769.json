  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We assess how the behavior of the system changes if a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), with M a constant matrix, is applied at different moments.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) naturally, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) evolved to t=T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions, leading to a different trajectory. Since \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) influences the system state by changing its initial state, the resulting state at time T can be significantly different unless M and D commute.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
