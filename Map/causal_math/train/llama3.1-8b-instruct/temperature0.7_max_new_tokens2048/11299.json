  "Problem": "Examine the response of a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Consider applying the Fourier transform \\\\(F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) to the function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and then analyzing its evolution under a given boundary condition transformation.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies the function by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), such as \\\\(f(x, y) = Lf(x, y)\\\\), will this intervention affect the outcome at later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) independent of whether the Fourier transform was initially applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) interacts with both the Fourier-transformed and untransformed states of \\\\(f\\\\), potentially affecting the evolution differently due to changes in properties enhanced or diminished by the transformation. Consequently, the effect of \\\\(L\\\\) and its permanence depend on whether the Fourier transform was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
