  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the integral transformation \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) for a particular \\\\( s \\\\), can we deduce the exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), the exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) can be directly deduced as the value that satisfies this equation for given \\\\( s \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is singularly responsible for the form of the resulting function from the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
