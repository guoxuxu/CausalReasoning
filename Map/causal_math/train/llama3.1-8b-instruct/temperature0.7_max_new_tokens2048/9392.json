  "Problem": "Imagine a complex system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{Ct} z dt \\\\) on the behavior of the system over time T.\n\nKnowing the resultant vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we specify precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied earlier?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity added by applying multiple transformations, each contributing complex exponential behaviors over time, identifying specific transformative actions solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible. Multiple combinations of initial conditions and transformative parameters could yield the same final state due to the non-linear interactions of these complex functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
