  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where z(t) is a complex-valued function, to explore integral transformations. Let's investigate the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a square matrix and x is a constant vector.\n\nKnowing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at a particular time T, can we infer the exact initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without additional information on the transformation applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( f(z) = (sI-A)^{-1}x \\\\) from the Laplace transform and its inverse properties, one can solve for \\\\( x \\\\) directly if the matrix \\\\( (sI-A) \\\\) is invertible. Hence, the knowledge of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at any point allows for the deduction of \\\\( x \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
