  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), with \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) a fixed complex constant. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the scaling factor introduced by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) remains ambiguous. This uncertainty about the scaling transformation makes it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
