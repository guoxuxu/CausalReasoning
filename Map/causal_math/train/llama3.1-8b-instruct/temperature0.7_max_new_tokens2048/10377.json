  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical system's response to an input signal, and we explore the effects of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with a convolution operation using another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAssuming the input signal to the system is \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and then converted via the Laplace transform to \\\\( F(s) \\\\), will \\\\( H(s) = F(s) \\\\) hold without any additional operations?",
  "Explanation": "Since the scenario does not include modifying actions like convolution or additional transformations, the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) will be effectively \\\\( F(s) \\\\), reflecting the input without alteration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
