  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) and no intervention is applied, will the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) has a Fourier transform that is a constant across frequencies. Thus, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = 1 \\\\) for all \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The output then naturally becomes \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) \\\\times 1 = H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which implies that without any modification, the output will just reflect the frequency response of the system defined by \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
