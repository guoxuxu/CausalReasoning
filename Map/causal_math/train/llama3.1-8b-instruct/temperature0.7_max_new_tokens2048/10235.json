  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nIf a different transformation, \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), is applied at any time t1 (0 < t1 < T), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the original function e^{it} and not on the transformation \\\\( T_1 \\\\) or \\\\( T_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( T_2(z) \\\\) further alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) now depends on the effects of both transforms. The square of any complex number (from \\\\( T_2 \\\\)) amplifies and changes the trajectory established by any prior transformation \\\\( T_1 \\\\), resulting in a state that reflects both influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
