  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) on this function, specifically, the Laplace transform.\n\nIf the system starts with \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and is allowed to evolve without intervention, applying the Laplace transform at any time \\\\( t \\\\geq 0 \\\\), would the transformed function \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) at s = \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\). At \\\\( s = i \\\\omega \\\\), this transform simplifies to an undefined value technically, yet under causal analytic frameworks in complex functions, the evaluation suggests a zero absorption at this pole under ideal conditions (infinitesimally small around the pole), indicating no net effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
