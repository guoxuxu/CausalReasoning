  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy\\\\), with A and C being constant matrices. Consider the effect of the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to pinpoint exactly which transformations (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, by merely knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the exponential transformations via \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) together with the natural dynamics from \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) make it challenging to isolate specific interventions definitively. Multiple intervention combinations can lead to equivalent endpoints, especially considering the convolutions arising from mixed matrix-interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
