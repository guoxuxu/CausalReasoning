  "Problem": "Assume a linear algebra context where we define the operation \\\\( L(v) = Sv \\\\) and \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\), with S and T being constant matrices. The system evolves according to the vector field defined by \\\\( L \\\\) initially, and we explore various modifications and impacts using the transformation \\\\( M \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the vector is subjected to another transformation, \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\), does the vector \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the initial transformation \\\\( S \\\\) or also on the interventions by \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediary application of \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the trajectory even if it is temporarily, and the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on both transformations, \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\). The system's behavior and its final state can thus reflect complex interactions between the transformations if they are non-commutative.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
