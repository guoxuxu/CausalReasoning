  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We study the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over complex variable s and real variable t.\n\nCan we determine the exact scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at any s, assuming no other information about the time-domain function or additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will indicate a scaled magnitude compared to the unaltered transformation. However, without additional constraints or data about the original magnitude, it is impossible to uniquely identify the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
