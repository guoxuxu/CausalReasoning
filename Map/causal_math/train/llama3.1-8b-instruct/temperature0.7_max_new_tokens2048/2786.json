  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of Laplace transformation on this system is analyzed by transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) separately.\n\nMapping back from the Laplace transformations, is it possible to uniquely determine the initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Laplace transform can provide reconstructions of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), ambiguities due to possible commonalities in the pole structures of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) may lead to multiple possible candidates for \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
