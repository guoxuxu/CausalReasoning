  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) evolving over time \\( t \\) with \\( \\omega \\) a real constant. An operation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) transforms \\( z(t) \\) into \\( z'(t) = \\mathcal{T}(z(t)) = z(t) + ce^{dt} \\) where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven \\( z'(T) \\), can we determine the initial function \\( z(0) \\) without knowledge about \\( c \\) and \\( d \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\( z(0) \\) accurately from \\( z'(T) \\) would require knowledge of both \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) since the added exponential term \\( ce^{dT} \\) alters \\( z(T) \\) significantly, masking or modifying the contribution from \\( z(0) = e^{0} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
