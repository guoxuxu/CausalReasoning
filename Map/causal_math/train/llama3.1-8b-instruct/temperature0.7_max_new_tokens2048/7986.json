  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nCan the original time-dependent function \\( z(t) \\) be uniquely determined from its Fourier transform \\( F(z(t)) \\) at specific \\( \\omega \\) values?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation is theoretically reversible under ideal conditions, meaning \\( z(t) \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( F(z(t)) \\) across all \\( \\omega \\). Thus, knowing the Fourier transform across a sufficient range of \\( \\omega \\) values allows for the reconstruction of \\( z(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
