  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) in a complex function domain, where \\( A \\) is a complex constant matrix and \\( x \\) is an initial complex vector. This setup is used to analyze the system's behavior under transformations involving integral transformations such as the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied via an additional transformation \\( f(s) = e^{Bs}s \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the outcome represented by \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) reflect solely the transformations governed by \\( A \\) without influence from \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( f(s) \\) introduces a new transformation aspect, encoding the effects of \\( B \\) alongside \\( A \\). This leads to a different trajectory in the complex domain, ensuring that \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\) will embody the influences of both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
