  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real functions of time t governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), and A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-B)s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) from the observed transformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral transformation's dependency on the exponential weighting factor \\\\( e^{(A-B)t} \\\\), the original state of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely reconstructed from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of whether and how \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied. The transformation obscures the initial conditions and interactions between x and y.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
