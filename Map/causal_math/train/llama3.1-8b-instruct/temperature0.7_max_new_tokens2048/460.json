  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), and consider its Laplace transform, which gives a function in the complex plane. Assume that this function represents the transfer function of a control system, where a and b are constants.\n\nGiven the output from the system post-intervention, can we precisely infer the exact nature of the intervention (specific changes in a and b) solely based on the output data?",
  "Explanation": "No, the output on its own is generally insufficient to determine uniquely the specific changes in parameters a and b, as similar outputs can be produced by varying these parameters in different ways, particularly in complex systems where the parameters may interact non-linearly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s → z; s → a → z; s → b → z; z → output; a → z; b → z; z → output; output → intervention",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
