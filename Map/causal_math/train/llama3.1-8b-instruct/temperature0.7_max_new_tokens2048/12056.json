  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process characterized by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real constants representing decay/growth rates and oscillatory behavior respectively. We explore the consequence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on the process.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time from t = 0 to t = T without any transformation, and then the integration \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied, does the result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) solely depend on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is a direct calculation based on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and does not depend on any factor other than the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) described in the function. Since no external interventions or transformations are applied before integration, the result directly reflects the impact of these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
