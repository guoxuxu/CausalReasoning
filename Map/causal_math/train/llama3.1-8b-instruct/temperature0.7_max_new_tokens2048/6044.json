  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented in matrix form \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. The system is transformed by performing a Laplace transform which alters the system to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform, and s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nKnowing that a modified system \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A') * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\) satisfies the transformed equation with a correction matrix C incorporated in the original system, can we determine the specifics of C solely from the equation in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The modified equation in the s-domain does not uniquely reveal the structure or specific elements of C, as multiple different matrices could potentially lead to the same transformed system. Additional information about C's relationship to A or specific properties would be required to uniquely identify it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
