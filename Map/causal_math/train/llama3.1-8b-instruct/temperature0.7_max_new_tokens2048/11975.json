  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the resulting function after applying \\\\( g(f) \\\\) at some point from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely whether matrix A or B, or both were involved?",
  "Explanation": "Given the superposition and potential entanglement effects in integral transformations with non-commutative matrices in the complex domain, it's impossible to deduce unequivocally whether and how both matrices influenced the transformation without additional constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
