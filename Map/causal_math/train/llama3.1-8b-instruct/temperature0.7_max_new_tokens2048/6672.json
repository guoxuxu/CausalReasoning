  "Problem": "Consider the system of complex functions defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is iterated over time t, generating a sequence in the complex plane that can exhibit dynamics typical of the Julia set. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix, on this sequence.\n\nGiven the specific endpoint of the sequence at t = T, can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), just by knowing the final value?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which specific transformations were applied merely by analyzing the endpoint is infeasible due to the complex interplay between the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the original iterative function. Each transformation option could lead to multiple potential sequences that reach the same endpoint, complicating precise identification of the prior interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
