  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tx} dt \\\\), and we wish to analyze how transformations influence the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) through various manipulations, involving either differentiation under the integral sign or Laplace Transform.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is modified at a point \\\\( x = t_1 \\\\) by a function \\\\( K(z) = z(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, and we continue to evaluate \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1, does the final value depend only on the initial function and not on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( K \\\\) adds a constant \\\\( c \\\\) to the existing function at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thereby altering the subsequent values permanently. Hence, the final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 will necessarily reflect the influence of the constant \\\\( c \\\\), not merely the behavior of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "differentiation under the integral sign → change in z(x); Laplace Transform → change in z(x); modification at x = t1 by K(z) → change in z(x); c → modification at x = t1 by K(z); change in z(x) → z(T); T > t1 → z(T)"
