  "Problem": "Consider a system of first-order differential equations where the rate of change of a vector function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), with \\\\(M\\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\(N\\\\) a constant vector. The system is affected by a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = Qz + R \\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(R\\\\) a constant vector.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify what interventions (if any) were applied, such as \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both, by solely knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of the matrix transformation interventions, due to their potential overlap in effects and the added constant vectors (R and T), creates a situation where multiple initial conditions and interventions could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This non-uniqueness prevents the exact determination of what transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "M → z; N → z; Q → z; R → z; g(z) → z; h(z) is not directly related to any of the other variables; z(T) → g(z); z(T) → h(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final state z(T) can be used to identify the transformation g(z), but not h(z), as z(T) directly causes g(z), indicating the application of g(z) can be inferred from the final state."
