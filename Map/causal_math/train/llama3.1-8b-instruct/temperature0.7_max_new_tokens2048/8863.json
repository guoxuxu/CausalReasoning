  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega 't} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is different from \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the integral \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T reflect only the effects of the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at the time of intervention, thus impacting the outcome of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The resulting integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T will incorporate effects due to both the original segment (0 to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) under frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the intervened segment (\\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T) under \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
