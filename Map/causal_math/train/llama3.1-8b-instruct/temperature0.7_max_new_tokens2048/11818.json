  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing a physical process, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We apply the Laplace transform to this function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), to analyze its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nIf during the evolution, a filtering operation defined by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied at a certain time T, will the resultant \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time > T depend only on the original Laplace transform and not on \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by acting as an additional transformation in the frequency domain. The final form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for times greater than T will depend both on the original form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
