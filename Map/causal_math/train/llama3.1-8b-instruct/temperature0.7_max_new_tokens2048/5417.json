  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\), where A and B are constants and \\\\(\\\\overline{z}\\\\) represents the complex conjugate of z. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to what it would have been if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition in a manner dependent on C. Since the differential equation involves non-linear interactions between z and its complex conjugate, the initial modification can significantly alter the trajectory and the resulting state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
