  "Problem": "Examine a complex function system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. The system's dynamics are altered by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) where C is a complex constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then permitted to progress under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\) without additional modifications, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was purely subjected to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\) up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) changes the initial condition by scaling and potentially rotating and/or applying non-linear transformations (in case of n>1) to the initial vector. This modification establishes a new trajectory, influenced by the powers of the initial state, making the resultant state at time T distinct.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
