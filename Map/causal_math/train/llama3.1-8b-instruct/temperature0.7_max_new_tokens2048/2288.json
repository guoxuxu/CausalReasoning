  "Problem": "Let's consider the complex plane where the function is defined as \\( z \\mapsto w = e^z \\). Investigate how the transformation of this function affects the analytical structure of a complex domain, specifically whether causal inference about the original complex value (z) can be derived from its transformation (w) under various circumstances.\n\nGiven the final observed outcome \\( w \\) after applying the intervention \\( w = e^{z+C} \\), can we uniquely identify the intervention (the value of C) and the original z?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the no-intervention case, the final result \\( w \\) can result from various combinations of C and z due to the periodic nature of the exponential function. Hence, the outcome \\( w \\) alone cannot uniquely decide both C and z without additional information or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
