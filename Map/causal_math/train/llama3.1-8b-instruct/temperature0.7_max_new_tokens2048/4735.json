  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We are curious about the effect of modifying the function f by a polynomial \\\\( p(t) = t^2 \\\\) before applying the integral transformation.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a specific time during the integral transformation by adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = t_1, will the end transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) solely depend on the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without reflecting the intervention of adding \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) directly affects the value of the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards. This change in the function results in a modified transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) that reflects both the original function and the impact of the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
