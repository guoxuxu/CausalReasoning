  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit RLC series where \\\\(R, L, C\\\\) represent resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. Let the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be a sinusoidal function described by \\\\(V(t) = V_0 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\) where \\\\(V_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. Investigate how the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) changes when subjected to the Laplace transform, which encodes different input conditions or interventions.\n\nGiven the observed current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) at a time T, can we precisely determine what types of inputs or electrical perturbations were applied (both the sinusoidal voltage and any impulse interventions) without knowledge of the exact times and magnitudes of these interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity added by the possibility of multiple overlapping interventions and system inherent responses makes it challenging to back-calculate to determine exact input types, times, and magnitudes. The current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions due to the nonlinear interactions between transient phenomena and steady state behavior in the RLC circuit.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
