  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a skew-symmetric matrix. Analyze the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) over time t, where N is another skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both), solely based on the final state value \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions like \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x) \\\\) from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone presents a high degree of ambiguity. The non-commutative nature of skew-symmetric matrix exponentials can lead to overlapping effects, potentially resulting in indistinguishable end-states from different combinations of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
