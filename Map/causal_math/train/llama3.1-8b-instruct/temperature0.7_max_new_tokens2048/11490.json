  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant. Analyses concern how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant, affect the function's behavior over iterations.\n\nIs it possible to determine the exact original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after several iterations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied and the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), it is impossible to deduce the precise initial point as the transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) (rotation) can correspond to multiple potential initiations leading to similar outcomes after iterating.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
