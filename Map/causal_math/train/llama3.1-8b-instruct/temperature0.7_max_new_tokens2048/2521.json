  "Problem": "Assume the function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) given by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\). Evaluate results and transformations within the complex plane, specifically considering the impact of modifications by linear transformations represented by complex constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the result \\\\(z\\\\) is then multiplied by a constant \\\\(a\\\\), will the outcome at \\\\(e^{az}\\\\) be the same as the direct application of \\\\(f(az_0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is not linear, thus \\\\(e^{az} != e^{a}e^{z}\\\\). Multiplying \\\\(z\\\\) by \\\\(a\\\\) after applying \\\\(f\\\\) results in a different transformation compared to directly applying \\\\(f\\\\) to \\\\(az_0\\\\), as exponentiation of a sum (which multiplication in the exponent amounts to) is not equivalent to the product of the exponentiations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
