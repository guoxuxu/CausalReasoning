  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit comprising an inductor \\(L\\), capacitor \\(C\\), and resistor \\(R\\), governing the charge \\(Q\\) on the capacitor. The dynamics of \\(Q\\) are described by the second-order differential equation \\(L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\\). We examine the effect of a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) introduced into the circuit at different times.\n\nIf a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) is applied from time \\(t = 0\\), does the system still follow the natural response induced originally by the RLC combination for all future times?",
  "Explanation": "When the voltage source is applied, it alters the free oscillations of the circuit defined by its characteristic natural frequency. The resulting behavior is a forced response superimposed on the natural response, comprising both the natural characteristics and the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the applied source.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
