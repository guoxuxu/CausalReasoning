  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influenced by an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')dt' \\\\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nConsidering the final state observed at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly determine the series or types of transformations applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only by using the information about \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations or sequences of applying the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), due to their integral and exponential characteristics, can lead to similar or identical endpoints at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to decipher the exact interventions used only based on the final observed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
