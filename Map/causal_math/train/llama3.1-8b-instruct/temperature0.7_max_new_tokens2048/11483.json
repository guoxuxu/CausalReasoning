  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined in a closed path in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are differentiable functions of t. The transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Tz = z^2 \\\\), applied to the path of z.\n\nAssuming an intervention \\\\( S \\\\) applied at t_1 where \\\\( S \\\\) is a translation operator on the complex plane, \\\\( Sz = z + c \\\\), does the end path at t = T solely depend on the original path and not on the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory by adding a constant complex number c. This addition changes the initial conditions post-t_1 which in conjunction with the initial transformation \\\\( T \\\\), alters the resulting path in a manner dependent on both operations' effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
