  "Problem": "Let's consider a time-dependent quantum system governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H(t) = H_0 + V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H_0 \\\\) is the time-independent part of the Hamiltonian and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent potential. We explore the outcomes of applying unitary transformations defined by \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\) on the state function \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a time-independent Hamiltonian.\n\nCan we infer the initial state function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( U \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( U \\\\) was applied, recovering \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) becomes inherently ambiguous. The potential alteration by \\\\( e^{-iBt} \\\\) introduces different possible initial states that could have evolved into the observed \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
