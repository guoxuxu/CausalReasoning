  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L: V \\\\rightarrow W \\\\) mapping between vector spaces V and W. We analyze the effect of a specific transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described as a multiplication by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), acting on vector space V before and after applying operator L.\n\nFrom observing the final vector \\\\( w \\\\) in W, can we precisely infer which transformations were applied on \\\\( v \\\\), be it none, \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential non-commuting nature of M and N, and the linearity of L, multiple combinations of applying \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), both, or none could lead to the same vector \\\\( w \\\\) in W. Hence, it is not possible to unequivocally deduce the applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
