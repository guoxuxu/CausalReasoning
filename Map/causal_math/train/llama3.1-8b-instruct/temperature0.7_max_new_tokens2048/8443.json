  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) describes a rotation with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We explore the response of the system when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a transformation using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( G(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants is applied as an intervention, will the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend distinctively on \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( G(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, making the trajectory and final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the original transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) but also on the intervening parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). This results in a compounded effect that distinctly reflects all transformation constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
