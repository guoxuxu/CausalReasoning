  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex variable \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then transformed using \\\\( T[f] \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed result depend solely on the parameter s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) will yield \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^t \\\\, dt = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{(1-s)t} \\\\, dt \\\\), which is indeed dependent solely on the parameter s, resulting in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) provided Re(s) > 1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
