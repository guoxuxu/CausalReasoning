  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which ensures that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analytic. Further, suppose a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, producing \\\\( L[z(t)] = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the altered Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to accurately back-calculate to determine whether the transformations or interventions used (the introduction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or other functional modifications) solely based on this transform?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a specific time T provides limited information about the specific interventions used. Multiple different transformations or combinations of modifications, especially with overlapping frequency components, can lead to the same or indistinguishable results in the Laplace domain. Thus pinpointing the exact interventions from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
