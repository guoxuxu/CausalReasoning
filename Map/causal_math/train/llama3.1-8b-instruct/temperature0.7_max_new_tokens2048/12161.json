  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation via a linear operator represented by an integral transformation \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\int h(t - \\tau)f(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response function. The output after transformation is denoted \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the input was \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( x(t)+\\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) without further information on the system's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or the nature of any possible distortions (like \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\)), it is impossible to reverse-engineer or distinguish the exact form of the input only based on the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → y(t); h(t) → y(t); x(t) + sin(ωt) → y(t)"
