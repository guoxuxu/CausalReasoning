  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nKnowing \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), can one definitively trace back to find the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform applied to \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) can reconstruct the time-domain function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) uniquely, including the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\), provided the system and transformations are stable and all inverse operations are defined and applicable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
