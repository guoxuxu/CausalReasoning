  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where the initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). We explore transformations using the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we definitively deduce the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could have undergone changes due to the transformation operation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), especially because the integral transformation might alter the phase and amplitude in a way that doesn't plainly divulge itself in the observed outputs at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
