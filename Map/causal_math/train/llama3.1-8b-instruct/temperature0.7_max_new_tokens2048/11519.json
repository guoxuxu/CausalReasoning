  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform, which we denote as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) = F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( z(x) + v \\\\) where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector in a complex plane prior to the Laplace transform, will the outcome \\\\( F(s) \\\\) solely depend on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( v \\\\) changes the function structure introduced to the Laplace transform, thus \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( w \\\\) but also the nature and components of \\\\( v \\\\). This intervention alters the Laplace output substantially by changing initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
