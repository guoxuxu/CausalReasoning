  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over [0, T] solely from knowledge of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) aggregates information across the interval [0, T] in a way that is not simple to invert, especially without explicit knowledge of whether the transformation was applied. This means that multiple different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result in the same result through \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), preventing a unique determination of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
