  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nConsidering an intervention where a new path is chosen at point \\\\\\\\(( z_1 \\\\\\\\)) such that it wraps around a circle centered at the origin before continuing to \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)), would this change the outcome of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the path to circle around the origin introduces a scenario where the path now encloses singularities related to the logarithmic branches implicit in the complex exponential function. This circling can affect the value of the integral by adding multiples of \\\\\\\\(( 2\\\\pi i \\\\\\\\)), depending on the number of times the path encircles the origin, thereby altering the outcome originally calculated by a straight path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
