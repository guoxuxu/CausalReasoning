  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study how an integral transformation by the operator \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}v dt \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, affects the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T(v) \\\\), \\\\( S(w) \\\\), or both), based solely on the data of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based on the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is complex due to the potential for various combinations of the transformations \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) to result in similar or identical outcomes. The nature of these transformations allows for different initial conditions and intervention applications to converge to the same endpoint under the observed conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
