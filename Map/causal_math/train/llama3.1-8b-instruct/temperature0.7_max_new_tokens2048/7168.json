  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nGiven the endpoint value of the Laplace Transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - c} \\\\) resulting from an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine exactly which constant (\\\\( b \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)) was influencing the function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed result \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - c} \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain whether the influence at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) was due to \\\\( b \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\), as the intervention could have completely overridden the initial influence of \\\\( b \\\\) with \\\\( c \\\\). The transformed function indicates the effective constant influencing the function immediately prior to transformation, not necessarily the initial constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
