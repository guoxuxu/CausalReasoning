  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) on this function.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) of the function, can we recover the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a spike at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), this exact original function can be uniquely determined by its Fourier transform, indicating a one-to-one mapping in this case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
