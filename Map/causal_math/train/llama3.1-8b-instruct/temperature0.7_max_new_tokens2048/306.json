  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing the system's state over time. We analyze the impact of a Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) which transforms a real function into another real function, typically shifting each frequency component by \\\\(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\).\n\nCan the original function state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be accurately deduced from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Hilbert transform was applied, one cannot definitively infer \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The phase shift introduced by \\\\( H \\\\) can significantly change the evolution path, making back-calculation to the original state ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the Hilbert transform H on either u(0) or v(0) directly influences z(T) due to the relationship H(u(0)) → u(T) and H(v(0)) → v(T), which in turn affects z(T)."
