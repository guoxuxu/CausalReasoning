  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant wave profile at T > t_1 still solely depend on the original wave equation dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Fourier transform as an intervention adds complexity by altering mode compositions from their evolved states at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the resultant wave profile reflects combined effects of original dynamics and transformations applied, not solely the original wave dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
