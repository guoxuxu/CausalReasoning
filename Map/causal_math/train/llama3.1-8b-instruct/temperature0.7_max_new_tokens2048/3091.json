  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where u and v are real functions of time and governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) over time t, where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) as an intervention changes the trajectory again in terms of both u and v components, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the interaction among A, B, C, and D matrices. This means that all transformations impact how the final solution is shaped and thus cannot be ignored.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
