  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is the temperature at a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\). We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, defined by the function \\\\(g(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) describes initial temperature distribution along the boundary.\n\nIf a new boundary condition is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) using a different transform, \\\\(g'(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h'(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), will the final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) only depend on the later transformation and not the original \\\\(g(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) will be affected by both the initial and subsequent boundary conditions because the Laplace system responses are cumulative. Changes introduced by \\\\(g'(s)\\\\) will superpose on the distribution already influenced by \\\\(g(s)\\\\), leading to a complex interplay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
