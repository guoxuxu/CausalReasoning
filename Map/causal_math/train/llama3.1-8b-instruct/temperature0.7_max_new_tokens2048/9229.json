  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, which alters the representation to depend on frequency variables \\\\( \\omega \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without intervention, will the solution at time t = T, \\\\( u(T) \\\\), be equivalent in the time domain to directly evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under \\\\( Lu \\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the domain from time to frequency, and hence, the evolution under \\\\( Lu \\\\) in the Fourier domain may not correspond identically to the time-domain evolution due to the potential for differing treatment by \\\\( L \\\\) in the frequency domain. Thus, inverse transforming \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will not necessarily give the same results as evolving in the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
