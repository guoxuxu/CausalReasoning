  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore how the response of the system changes under the effect of external operators such as differentiation or integration over time.\n\nIf the function is differentiated at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thus changing its form to \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), will the final expression of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original parameters without reflecting the differentiation?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation acts as an intervention that alters the form and hence the trajectory of the function. The factor \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) introduced by differentiation modifies the amplitude and the response of the system, making the final state reflect this intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
