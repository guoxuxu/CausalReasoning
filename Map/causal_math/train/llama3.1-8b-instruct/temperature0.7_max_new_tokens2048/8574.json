  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are complex variables and the function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\). Here, A and B are constant matrices. We assess how the sequence of partial differentiation with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) and their integrations influence the outcome.\n\nGiven the transformed function after differentiation and integration, can we uniquely determine the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The loss of information during integration (constants of integration) and the non-commutative nature of the matrix exponentiation can obscure the original matrix values, making it impossible to uniquely recover A and B from transformations alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Differentiation of x → Derivative of f with respect to x; Differentiation of y → Derivative of f with respect to y; Differentiation of x and y → Second-order partial derivatives of f; Differentiation of f with respect to x and y → Second-order partial derivatives of f; Integration of Derivative of f with respect to x → f; Integration of Derivative of f with respect to y → f; Integration of f → Original function f; Second-order partial derivatives of f → Constant A and B; Constant A and B → f"
