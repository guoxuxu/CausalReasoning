  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a(x,t) u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) is a function describing the velocity at point x and time t. We examine the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i x \\\\xi} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) by inverting the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,T)\\\\), observed at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), without additional information about the function \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the velocity function \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\), which influences how features in \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) advect over time, it is not possible to reliably invert the Fourier transform to retrieve \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\). Information about \\\\(a(x,t)\\\\) is critical to account for changes in phases and amplitudes in the transform space.",
