  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the current state is modified by a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear function. The linear transformation is represented by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the nonlinear function is \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the state vector in a complex function space.\n\nIf the state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is initially transformed by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and then the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied without further manipulation, will the final state at some time \\\\( t \\\\) be predictable solely based on \\\\( M \\\\) without knowledge of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The nonlinear nature of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) means that it affects the dynamics in a way that cannot be inferred just from knowing \\\\( M \\\\). The square operation and addition of a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) inherently change the trajectory and final state, making it unpredictable without knowledge of \\\\( h \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
