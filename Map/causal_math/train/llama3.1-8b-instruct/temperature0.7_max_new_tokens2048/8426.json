  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency of oscillation in radians per second. This defines a system where \\( z(t) \\) traces a circular path in the complex plane. Investigate the impact of a linear transformation \\( L(z) = Az + b \\) with complex constants A and b.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( L(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\( L(z) \\) was applied, the observed location in the complex plane might correspond to multiple initial conditions due to the scaling and translating effects of A and b. Knowing \\( A \\) and \\( b \\) is crucial to unambiguously map back to \\( z_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
