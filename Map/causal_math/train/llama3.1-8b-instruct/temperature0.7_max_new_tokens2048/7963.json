  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(g(x)) \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), which is subsequently evolved via Laplace transform \\\\( L(h(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\) over time variable t.\n\nIf, at some time during the transformation, an inverse Laplace transform is applied as an intervention, will the resultant function only depend on the Fourier transform and not the initial function \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an inverse Laplace transform as an intervention introduces a reciprocal operation, but the final outcome still depends on the Fourier transform and the inherent properties of the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\). The entire sequence of transformations and the initial function characteristics influence the resulting function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform of g(x) → Laplace transform of h(t); Laplace transform of h(t) → Inverse Laplace transform; Fourier transform of g(x) → h(t); Inverse Laplace transform → Resultant function; g(x) → Fourier transform of g(x)"
