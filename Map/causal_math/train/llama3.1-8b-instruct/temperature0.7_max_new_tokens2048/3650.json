  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(x)) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-(x-t)} u(t) dt \\\\), on functions and its implications in a functional space. We explore whether this transformation can alter or trace back the cause of changes in function behaviors.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) after applying the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and observing the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(x) \\\\) at a later stage?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of invertibility of the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) in general circumstances means that multiple functions could result in the same transformed function, making it infeasible to uniquely deduce \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) merely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(x) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
