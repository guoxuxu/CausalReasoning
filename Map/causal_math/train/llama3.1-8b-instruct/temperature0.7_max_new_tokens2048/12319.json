  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} - ci \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are real constants.\n\nKnowing the function at \\\\( t = T \\\\) after an intervention, is it possible to ascertain exactly which form of intervention (change in coefficients or differential operator) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final form at \\\\( t = T \\\\) can arise from different interventions in coefficients or in the operator \\\\( D \\\\), as the function's phase and magnitude at \\\\( t = T \\\\) could align with multiple potential changes made during \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making it infeasible to uniquely distinguish the specific intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
