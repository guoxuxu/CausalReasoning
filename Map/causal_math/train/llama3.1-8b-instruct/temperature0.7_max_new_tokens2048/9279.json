  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where a new frequency \\\\( B \\\\) was introduced (changing the rate of rotation to \\\\( e^{iB(t-t_1)} \\\\)), will the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely determined by the initial properties and A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new frequency B starting at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), thereby altering the rotation rate. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the initial conditions, the portion of the trajectory influenced by A, and the subsequent trajectory determined by B. Thus, the outcome is influenced by the initial state, A, B, and the timing of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
