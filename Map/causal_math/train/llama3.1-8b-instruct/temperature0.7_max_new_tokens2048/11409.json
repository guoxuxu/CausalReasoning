  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) initially at t = 0 and then evolved over time up to \\\\( T \\\\), will \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) be identical to applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly on \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) up to \\\\( T \\\\) without first evaluating \\\\( L(z)(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linear transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) when applied initially or at any subsequent time up to \\\\( T \\\\) essentially computes the same integral over the interval from 0 to \\\\( T \\\\). This is because \\\\( L \\\\) acts linearly and time-invariantly across the entire range specified, thus yielding the same result regardless of when it's computed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
