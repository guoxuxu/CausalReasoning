  "Problem": "Consider a differential system expressed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix representing the dynamics of the system. We explore the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\{Dx\\\\})(s)\\\\) and observe how the system behaves with an intruding function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(t)x \\\\).\n\nIf during the system's evolution at a specific time t_1, the function \\\\(g(x)\\\\) intervenes, altering the trajectory of \\\\(x\\\\), will the transformed state \\\\(x(s)\\\\) still solely depend on D, disregarding the effects of \\\\(g(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\(g(x) = \\\\sin(t)x\\\\) introduces a new governing factor that dynamically impacts the state of \\\\(x\\\\), not just dependent on D. This sine function embeds additional properties into the temporal system's evolution, thus influencing not only the immediate state but also subverting the subsequent Laplace domain representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
