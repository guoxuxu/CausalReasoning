  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. The function describes the combined influence of two transformations on initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine what vectors were introduced as interventions (\\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\)), and their timing (\\\\( t_1 \\\\)), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although we know the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), the specific vectors \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) as well as the exact timing \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of their introduction lead to multiple possibilities that could achieve the same end state due to the continuous and overlapping effects of the matrix exponentials on different vectors. Thus, various combinations of vectors and timings might yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
