  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The transformation specified by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to study the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without any further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state of the system by altering its phase and magnitude depending on the structure and coefficients of N. Given that \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) does not necessarily commute with M, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ when it evolves from the transformed initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
