  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. This scenario explores how the Laplace transform impacts the behavior of the function over time.\n\nGiven the final form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) from a transformed function involving multiple exponential interventions (e.g., \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and later \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\)), can we conclusively identify the exact interventions (values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)) solely based on the outcome \\\\( z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the scenario where \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} + \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), each term associated with the respective interventions distinctly reflects the specific exponents \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used. Knowing the form of the transform, the separate contributions and values can be conclusively determined from the poles of each term.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
