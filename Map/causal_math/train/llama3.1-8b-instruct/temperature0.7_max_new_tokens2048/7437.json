  "Problem": "Let's examine a scenario involving a complex function and its transformation using a Fourier Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a frequency. We analyze the effect of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) and analyzed in the frequency domain without further intervention, does \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) exhibit delta-function behavior at \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0) \\\\) at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\). This is due to the property that the Fourier Transform of an exponential function with a purely imaginary exponent results in a delta function centered at the frequency of the exponent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
