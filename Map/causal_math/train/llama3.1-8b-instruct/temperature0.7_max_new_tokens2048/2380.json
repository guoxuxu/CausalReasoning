  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the function \\\\( p(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) represents the pressure at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). The evolution of pressure is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Now, analyze the scenario under transformation given by the function \\\\( h(p) = e^{-kt} p \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final pressure distribution \\\\( p(x, T) \\\\), can we accurately deduce the specific interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(p) \\\\), \\\\( q(p) \\\\), or both), based solely on observing \\\\( p(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compounded effects of multiple exponential transformations applied at different times introduce significant complexities in isolating which specific transformations were applied when. This complexity arises from exponential terms potentially having similar effects on the evolving state, leading to ambiguities in distinguishing between the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
