  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) after applying the transformation to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), can we deduce the exact nature of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) across the entire interval from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation provides a mixed representation of the original function across the interval and obscures individual characteristics at specific points since integrals, especially under exponential multipliers, typically blend function values across the entire interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
