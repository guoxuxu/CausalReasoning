  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is used to modulate an input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The output signal is given by \\\\(y(t) = z(t) \\\\cdot x(t)\\\\). The goal is to study the changes in the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) as compared to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven \\\\(y(t)\\\\) with a known Fourier Transform, can we uniquely determine \\\\(x(t)\\\\) if we do not know \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or whether such modulation \\\\(z(t)\\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the modulation frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or even if such modulation occurred, it is ambiguous to deduce back to \\\\(x(t)\\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(x(t)\\\\) could produce similar \\\\(y(t)\\\\) signatures in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
