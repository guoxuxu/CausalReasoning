  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) of a function u(t), where u(t) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0 \\\\). Consider an intervention where a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is introduced to the solution u(t) before transforming it.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformation of the modified function (post-intervention with \\\\( e^{st} \\\\)), can we precisely deduce if \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) was the modification applied, based only on the transformed function \\\\( U(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Several modifications on u(t) could yield similar or indistinguishable transformations in U(s). Without additional information about the nature of the interventions or states prior to transformation, the specific modification cannot be determined uniquely due to the possibility of equivalent effects from different modification functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
