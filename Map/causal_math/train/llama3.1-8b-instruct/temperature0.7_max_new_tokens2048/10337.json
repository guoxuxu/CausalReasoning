  "Problem": "Assume a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolves over time t governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\), with A being a complex constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to develop under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the initial point, altering the trajectory of the system. The presence of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) can significantly change the system dynamics depending on how A and B interact, resulting in a different point at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
