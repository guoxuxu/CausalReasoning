  "Problem": "Assume a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform on this function over the variable t.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function at s = a, can we deduce with certainty the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From the form of the Laplace transform, which is \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), the pole at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) directly gives the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original exponential function. No additional information is required to infer \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
