  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices and x is the initial state vector. We explore how the Laplace Transform and its inverse affect the system's behavior over time.\n\nAfter observing the system's state at time T, can we identify whether an intervention (like the multiplication by D) occurred without knowing the specifics of matrices A, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether an intervention such as matrix multiplication by D occurred is not possible merely by observing the result at time T, particularly without detailed knowledge of the matrices involved. Different combinations and timings of applications of A, C, and D can yield similar end states, leading to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Observation of system state at time T → Can identify intervention; \nInitial state vector x → System state at time T; \nMatrix D → System state at time T if an intervention occurred; \nMatrix A and C → System state at time T"
