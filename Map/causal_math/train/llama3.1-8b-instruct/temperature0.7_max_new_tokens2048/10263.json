  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) mapping real numbers to complex numbers. We explore the transformation driven by the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to this function resulting in \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), and analyze its impact under different conditions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(h(t) = t\\\\cdot x(t)\\\\) is applied as an intervention before calculating the Fourier transform, will \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) reflect only the effects of the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and not the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) alters the function by adding a time-dependent scaling, which changes the derivative properties and consequently the Fourier transform. This results in a transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) that reflects both the original characteristics and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
