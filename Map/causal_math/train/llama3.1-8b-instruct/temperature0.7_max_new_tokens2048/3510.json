  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), with a control input \\\\( u \\\\). Here, A is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics and B is the control matrix. An operator applies a transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where C is another constant matrix determining a specific kind of state transformation.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the initial state transformation \\\\( T(0) = e^{C0}x_0 \\\\) applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), without any control input adjustments (\\\\( u = 0 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific initial transformation from the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible without knowing the specific effects of matrix C or without additional information to isolate its influence from the dynamics solely defined by the matrix A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
