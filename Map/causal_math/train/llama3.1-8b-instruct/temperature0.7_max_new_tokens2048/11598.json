  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system controlled by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Lz(t) + K \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\), where L and K are constant matrices. We examine the influence of the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impossible without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The operator \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could have significantly changed the initial state, making it indeterminable from the end state without additional information on the transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
