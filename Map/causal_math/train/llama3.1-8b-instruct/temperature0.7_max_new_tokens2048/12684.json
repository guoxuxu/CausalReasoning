  "Problem": "We consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the impact of a transformation \\( h(z) = Mz \\) applied at time t, where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf \\( h(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\( h(z) \\) changes the initial vector to \\( Mz_0 \\), so the evolving solution under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) starts from \\( Mz_0 \\) instead of \\( z_0 \\). Unless M commutes with \\( e^{Dt} \\), the vector \\( z(t) \\) will not be the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
