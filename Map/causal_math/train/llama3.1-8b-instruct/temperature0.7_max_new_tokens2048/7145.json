  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z is a function representing system states over time. The impact of applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and allowed to evolve under the influence of A without further intervention, will the final output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be influenced by the transformation at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a different weighting to the variable z, effectively changing its characteristics through the integration influenced by matrix B over the original function z. This modified state of z will alter how the system evolves under A, impacting the final output computed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
