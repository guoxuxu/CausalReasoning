  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) evolves over time t, and study the effect of the Laplace transform, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this complex function.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at some s, can we ascertain whether an intervention \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\) was applied at a certain \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and determine the value of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, while reflecting changes due to the intervention, does not allow for the unambiguous determination of the specific intervention details such as exact time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and magnitude of \\\\( a \\\\), because multiple interventions could theoretically produce equivalent transformations in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
