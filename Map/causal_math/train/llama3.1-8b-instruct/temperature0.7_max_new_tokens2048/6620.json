  "Problem": "Analyze a system where the temperature distribution along the line, u(x,t), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where k is the diffusivity constant. We consider the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\), where v is a constant scalar added at a specific time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\), \\\\(h(u)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) can result from different sequences or types of interventions due to the nature of linear additions and subtractions on the initial condition and throughout the system's evolution. The endpoint alone does not provide enough information to uniquely distinguish whether only \\\\(g(u)\\\\), only \\\\(h(u)\\\\), both, or neither were applied, as multiple combinations could yield the same final temperature distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
