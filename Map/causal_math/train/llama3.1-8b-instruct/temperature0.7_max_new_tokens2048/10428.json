  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The complex function transformations involve \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices operating in the complex domain over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying exact interventions from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the complexities introduced by the non-linear transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\). These transformations can produce similar effects on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making it impossible to distinguish between them or determine their sequence strictly from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
