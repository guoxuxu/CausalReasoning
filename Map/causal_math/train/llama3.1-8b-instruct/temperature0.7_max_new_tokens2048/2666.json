  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\\\), where k is a positive constant. The system undergoes an analysis involving a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing the system's history?",
  "Explanation": "The linear nature of the decay and the Fourier transform allows exact recovery of the initial condition from the decayed spectrum at any time T. The transform is reversible, preserving information about the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
