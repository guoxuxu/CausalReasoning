  "Problem": "Consider a system where the behavior of a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time is determined by its Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\. Suppose we apply the inverse Laplace transform after manipulating the function in the s-domain by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\).\n\nBased on the observed outcome \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) at time T > t_1 after the application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at t = t_1, is it possible to determine exactly which transformations were applied only by examining \\\\( z''(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) might not uniquely indicate the sequence or types of transformations applied due to the properties of convolution and the overlapping impact of the transformations in the s-domain, hence making it difficult to precisely backtrack the interventions done.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
