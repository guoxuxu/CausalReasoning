  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of a transformation via the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t,x)\\\\} = U(s,x) \\\\) over variable t.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform and the system is evolved according to the heat equation, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) at some time T be equivalent to if it was evolved directly from \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform changes the domain from the time to the complex frequency domain, which modifies how the solution behaves and evolves under the heat equation. Therefore, the inverse transform of \\\\( U(s,x) \\\\) at a later time T will not generally yield the same result as the direct time evolution of \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) under the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
