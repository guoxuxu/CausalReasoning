  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We examine the impact of a transformation by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, on the system's evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) alters the amplitude of the state by a factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T} \\\\), affecting both magnitude and possibly the phase when combined with the harmonic term, leading to a different state at time T than if simply evolving under \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
