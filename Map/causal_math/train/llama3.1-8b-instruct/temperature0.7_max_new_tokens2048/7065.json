  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), known as the wave equation. We explore the influence of a Fourier transform applied initially (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\)) and how it impacts the propagation of the wave over time.\n\nDoes applying a Fourier transform to the initial wave profile \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\), and then allowing the system to evolve under the wave equation without further manipulation, lead to the same wave profile at a future time T as evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the initial condition by transforming it into the frequency domain. The subsequent evolution under the wave equation then proceeds from this altered state, leading to a different outcome at time T as the system responds differently to frequency components than to spatial components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
