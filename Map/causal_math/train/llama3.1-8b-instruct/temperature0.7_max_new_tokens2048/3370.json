  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) operating in the complex plane. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this function, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nGiven a Fourier spectrum showing a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), can we confirm that the original function was specifically \\\\( z(x) = \\\\exp(ix) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Although a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) in the Fourier spectrum strongly suggests that the original function had a frequency component of \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), it does not exclusively confirm that the function was \\\\( \\\\exp(ix) \\\\). Other phase shifts or amplitude variations could yield a similar result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
