  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is initially governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced where C is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially, is it possible to precisely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation was applied, and considering that C could introduce nontrivial scaling and rotation to both components of \\\\( z \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as the real and imaginary parts could have been scaled by different exponential factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
