  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system when subjected to different kernel transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) leading to a convolution integral \\\\( (u*h)(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(\\\\tau)h(t-\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) and its impact on the output used in signal processing.\n\nGiven the combined Laplace transform output \\\\( Z(s) = U(s)H(s) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely identify the separate functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used in the convolution, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The decomposition of a Laplace transform resulting from a convolution into its constituents is non-unique without additional information. \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could be various pairs of functions that satisfy the equation \\\\( Z(s) = U(s)H(s) \\\\). This impossibility reflects the inability to deduce unique causality (separate functions) purely from composite effect (combined transform).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
