  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit represented by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the frequency complex variable, and circuit behavior is regulated by this impedance function. The circuit undergoes a Fourier transformation which impacts the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf, at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new signal modification through a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( R(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through convolution with \\\\( K(t) \\\\) alters the output response, which now becomes a convolution of the response due to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and the kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\). This changes the endpoint \\\\( R(T) \\\\), making it dependent on both \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( K(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
