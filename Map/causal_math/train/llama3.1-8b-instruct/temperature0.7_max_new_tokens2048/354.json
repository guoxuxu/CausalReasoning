  "Problem": "We examine a system defined by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and how it affects the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) over time are investigated.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at t = 0 be completely determined after only observing the transformed solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) was applied, reconstructing the original function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from the solution at time T is ambiguous. The transformation could materially alter the spectral characteristics of the original, making it non-trivial to reverse without that information.",
