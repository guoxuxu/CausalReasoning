  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), transitioning through the system defined by \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\), where c is a complex constant. This scenario examines causal inference in system's transformations and their reversibility.\n\nIf the system is initially at \\\\(z_0\\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\) for a period T, does the outcome solely depend on \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the choice of c?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome at time T is determined entirely by the initial value \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the constant c, as the system’s evolution is governed uniquely by these parameters under the specified transformation without external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
