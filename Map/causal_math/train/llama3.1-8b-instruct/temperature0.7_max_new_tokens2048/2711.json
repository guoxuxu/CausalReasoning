  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) (where \\( C \\) is another constant matrix) is applied, will the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory from \\( t_1 \\) onwards resulting in \\( z(T) = e^{C(T-t_1)}e^{BT_1}e^{AT_1}x_0 \\). As all matrices \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) are involved in transforming the state, the end state depends on all three matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
