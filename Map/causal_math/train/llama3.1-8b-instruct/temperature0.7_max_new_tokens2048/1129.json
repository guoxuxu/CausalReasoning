  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency in a physical context. The function is then transformed through an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at the beginning and then allow the system to evolve by re-applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further transformation, will the resulting function at time T be the same as if the transformation was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "When the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, it modifies the whole signal in a way that is irreversible merely by allowing the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve naturally afterwards. The integral transformation changes the entire nature of the function across the whole time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
