  "Problem": "Given the complex function defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), assess the effect of a contour integration transformation where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) traces a path specified by functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nCan the impact of the intervention on the path be isolated and identified purely based on the final integral result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific type and location of intervention purely from the integral result is challenging due to the complex interaction between path alterations and their exponential effects on the function. Multiple interventions can result in similar integral values, making precise determination difficult without more specific data on the path or the nature of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
