  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. This function is subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be correctly recovered from the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without knowledge of the modification by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) if applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without knowing whether and how \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied is uncertain. The modification could have substantially altered the function's characteristics in such a way that the original function and its structure cannot be deduced solely from the transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
