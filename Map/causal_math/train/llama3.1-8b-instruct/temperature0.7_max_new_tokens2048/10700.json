  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The influence of a linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\) is analyzed, with D being another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the specific transformations used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\) or both were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is fundamentally challenging. This is because multiple sequences of transformations can lead to similar or identical outcomes due to the properties of linear transformations and matrix exponentials, creating inherent uncertainties in retracing the precise pathways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
