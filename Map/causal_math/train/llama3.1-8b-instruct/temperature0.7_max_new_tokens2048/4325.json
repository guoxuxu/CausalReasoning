  "Problem": "Consider a circuit system described by the integral \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-sA} x(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix that represents system parameters and \\( x(t) \\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the input signal using a transformation defined by \\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to the input signal \\( x_0(t) \\) initially and \\( y(t) \\) evolves naturally under the given integral equation, will the output \\( y(T) \\) at \\( T \\) be the same as if \\( x_0(t) \\) was directly used without applying \\( f(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\) alters the input signal, thus changing the integration process. This modification affects how the input signal \\( x(t) \\) is processed through the system, leading to a different output \\( y(T) \\) because the integral will involve terms modified by \\( e^{Bt} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
