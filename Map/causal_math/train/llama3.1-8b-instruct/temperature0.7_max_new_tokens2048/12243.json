  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the electric potential \\\\( V \\\\) in a region is governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 V = 0 \\\\). An external operator manipulates the boundary conditions or introduces additional charge densities \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\), which changes the solutions of the equation.\n\nGiven the final potential distribution \\\\( V(T) \\\\), is it possible to accurately determine the sequence of charge density modifications (like \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\rho_1 \\\\)) and the type of boundary manipulations made, just from the end state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the superposition principle applicable in linear systems like the Laplace equation, multiple configurations of charge densities and boundary manipulations could lead to the same final potential distribution. There's inherent ambiguity in retroactively determining specific interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
