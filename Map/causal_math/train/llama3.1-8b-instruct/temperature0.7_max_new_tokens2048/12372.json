  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\\\) over a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u = f \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). We examine the result of initial transformations using the eigenfunction expansions of \\\\( u \\\\) and how tool-based interventions like Laplacian solvers act.\n\nIf \\\\( f \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform before being applied as a boundary condition, then the solution \\\\( u \\\\) develops under natural evolution of the system. Will this transformation impact solutions at any point \\\\( x, y \\\\) within \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( f \\\\) by a Fourier transform changes the frequency components of the boundary values. Since the boundary conditions directly influence the solution within \\\\( D \\\\) using eigenfunction expansions, altered frequencies will modify the resultant field of \\\\( u \\\\) throughout the domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
