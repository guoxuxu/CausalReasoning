  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane as \\(z(t) = e^{At}z_0\\), where \\(A\\) is a complex constant and \\(z_0\\) is the initial complex value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation given by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\) on the system, where \\(B\\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex value \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( z(T) \\) without knowing whether \\( T(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the integral transformation's application, the effect observed at \\( t = T \\) may not be relatable directly back to \\( z_0 \\) because \\( T(z) \\) introduces modifications across the evolution path that cannot be unambiguously reversed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
