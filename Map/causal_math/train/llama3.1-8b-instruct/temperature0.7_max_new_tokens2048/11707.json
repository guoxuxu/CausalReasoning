  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + B\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + D\\\\), respectively. We investigate the behavior under the integral transform \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention alters the differential equations to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = (A + F)x + (B + G)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = (C + H)y + (D + I)\\\\) where F, G, H, I are constants, at a middle time point \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\). Will this intervention affect the outcome of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) given the initial transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the governing dynamics of \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\), influencing their behavior from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\), which in turn affects \\\\(z(t)\\\\) through its definition. Since \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) accumulates the history of z(t) transformed by the exponential factor, the modifications in dynamics post-\\\\(t_1\\\\) will influence the cumulative integral, thus affecting \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
