  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. The causal implications are explored by applying a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) to the system.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is set, and the system is allowed to evolve according to its differential equation without any external intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( s \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and the initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Given that no external intervention is applied, the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) fully encapsulates the system's evolution based on its initial condition, the constant \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The linearity and time-invariance of the system under these conditions ensure that the transformed function is solely dependent on these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
