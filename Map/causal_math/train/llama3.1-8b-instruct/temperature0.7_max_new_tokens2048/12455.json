  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The response of the system to inputs is investigated under the influence of a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), with K being another constant matrix.\n\nCan we definitively determine the interventions taken (either \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) upon observing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can potentially be reached via varying paths influenced by either or both transformations, as matrices K and M can have overlapping effects dependent on their algebraic properties relative to D. The identical outcomes from different transformations result in unresolved ambiguities in determining specifically which interventions were executed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
