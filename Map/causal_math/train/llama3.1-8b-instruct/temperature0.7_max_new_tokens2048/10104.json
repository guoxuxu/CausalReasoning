  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function in a variable \\\\( t \\\\). The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant. We test the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is fraught with challenges due to the potential overlap in effects from \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\). These transformations could have similar influences on the trajectory, making it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions involved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
