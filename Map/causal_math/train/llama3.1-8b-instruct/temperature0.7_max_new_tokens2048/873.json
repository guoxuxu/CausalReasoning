  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function describing displacement and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. The Laplace transform is used to study how system characteristics change when subject to different conditions or transformations.\n\nIf the initial condition for \\\\( u(0) \\\\) is set and the system evolves under its natural dynamics without any intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same regardless of the value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which includes the factor \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will depend on the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) affects the transform's poles and zeros, thus influencing the frequency components represented in \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial condition u(0) directly influences z(t), and the angular frequency ω directly influences z(t) and z(T). The time t directly influences z(t), and the displacement u(t) directly influences z(t). The time T directly influences z(T), but the angular frequency ω has no influence on the Laplace transform of z(t) at some time T."
