  "Problem": "Analyzing a scenario where Z is a complex function defined as \\\\(Z(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t) \\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is a function that represents a system's response. We are interested in how changes in the real or imaginary part of \\\\(z\\\\) influence \\\\(Z(z)\\\\), and how interventions through transformational functions could affect the outputs.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(h(t) = h(t) e^{-ct}\\\\) where \\\\(c\\\\) is a real constant is applied to the system at a moment \\\\(t_1\\\\), does this make the magnitude of \\\\(Z(z)\\\\) for times larger than \\\\(t_1\\\\) independent of changes to the real part of \\\\(z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformation \\\\(h(t) e^{-ct}\\\\) does alter the system's behavior by introducing additional decay, this intervention does not decouple the influence of changes in the real part of \\\\(z\\\\). Both the transformed system characteristics and the real part of \\\\(z\\\\) together will determine \\\\(Z(z)\\\\) post-intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
