  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are components following the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The interplay between multiple exponential transformations (from C and D) affects how the system evolves post-intervention. Changes introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) along with prior modifications by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) lead to a final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that depends on both C and D, as well as the original dynamics governed by A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
