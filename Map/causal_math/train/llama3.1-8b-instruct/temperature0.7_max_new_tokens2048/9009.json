  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time t, governed by the set of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine the effects of a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) performed at time t = 0.\n\nWill the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) remain unchanged over time t if the initial state had undergone Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform to the initial state changes the complex function's initial condition. This transformation modifies how both the real part \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the imaginary part \\\\( v(t) \\\\) evolve, as the transform alters initial amplitude and decay rates depending on the poles introduced by A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
