  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nIf the modulation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to x(t) to create a new signal \\\\( x'(t) = x(t)e^{at} \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) is transformed using Fourier, will \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in a frequency shift in the Fourier domain. This shift is governed by the property \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)e^{at}\\\\} = z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\), changing the frequencies present in the output compared to the unmodulated signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
