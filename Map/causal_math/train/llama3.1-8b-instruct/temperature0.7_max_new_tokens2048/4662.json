  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and its dependency on the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) drastically affects initial conditions. Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and given the non-invertibility of integral transformations compounded by exponential matrix effects, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
