  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane \\\\( z \\\\) described by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. We explore the effects on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) when \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a linear function \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) transforms \\\\( z \\\\) initially and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed over time without further intervention, does the transformation affect subsequent values of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) compared to direct computation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on untransformed \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\) alters the argument of the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and since the integral transformation in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends explicitly on \\\\( z \\\\), any change in \\\\( z \\\\) directly affects the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( f(az+b) \\\\) generally differs from \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
