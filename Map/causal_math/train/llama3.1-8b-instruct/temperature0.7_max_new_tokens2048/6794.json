  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = T^{-1}e^{Dt}Tx \\\\) is considered, where T is an invertible matrix and D is a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing that \\\\( h(x) \\\\) may or may not have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), and without additional information about T and D relative to M, the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be accurately deduced from \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The transformations due to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could involve rotation, scaling, or more complex changes depending on the interplay of T, D, and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
