  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nKnowing the final integral result after several interventions, including shifting and scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), and changing the function form, can we determine what specific transformations were made?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome from the integral transformation after multiple interventions is influenced by each step's specifics, which can cause similar effects in the integral's value. Given the multiplicity and variability in how each parameter can affect the result, determining the exact transformations from the integral's final value is implausible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
