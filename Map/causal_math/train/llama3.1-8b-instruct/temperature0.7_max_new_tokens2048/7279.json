  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( \\mathcal{G}[u(x, t)] \\) is applied as an intervention, and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) is a Laplace transform, will the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on the evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) and not on the effects of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) introduces a transformation that, in conjunction with \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), alters the state of the system in both the frequency and complex plane domains. The endpoint \\( u(x, T) \\) will depend on all transformations applied (both \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\)) and the initial PDE dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
