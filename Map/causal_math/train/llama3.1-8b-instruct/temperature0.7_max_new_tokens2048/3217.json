  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the continuous mapping of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a real constant, and z represents a complex variable. This function is then subjected to a transformation via a linear operator T that acts as an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} e^{st} f(1-s) ds \\\\), where c and s are complex variables and t is a real parameter.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is mapped at z = 0 and transformed over time t using operator T without further manipulation, will the resultant function at t = T be equal to the original function at z = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involving the linear operator T fundamentally changes the nature and characteristics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) through the integral transformation and the interaction with exponential and complex elements, resulting in a different function from the original at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
