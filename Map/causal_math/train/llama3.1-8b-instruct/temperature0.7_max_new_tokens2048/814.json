  "Problem": "We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), on its related differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), the Fourier transform of the signal after evolving until t = T, can the original frequency spectrum \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = 0 be reconstructed accurately?",
  "Explanation": "If the decay parameter 'a' is known, one can retrieve the original frequency spectrum by reversing the exponential decay factor: \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = X(\\\\omega, T)e^{aT} \\\\). The recovery of \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) from \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) is exact, assuming knowledge of 'a'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
