  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit system modeled by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where Z represents impedance as a function of the complex variable s. We are analyzing the impact of a Laplace transform on an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( X(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of the time-domain signal.\n\nIf a modification to the signal processing method occurs midway (using another Laplace transform-related function, \\\\( W(s) = e^{-s} \\\\)), impacting the input during its course through the system, will the resultant output in the Laplace domain \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not on the introduced function \\\\( W(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( W(s) \\\\) acts as an intervention, affecting the input signal's progression and the resulting output by modifying the exponential decay characteristics. \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) will be a product that incorporates changes introduced by both \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( W(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
