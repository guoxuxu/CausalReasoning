  "Problem": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of a substance \\\\( C(t) \\\\) evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a reaction rate constant. We analyze how applying a transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) affects the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(C) \\\\) operates on an initial concentration \\\\( C_0 \\\\) and the system is then left to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \\\\) without any additional interventions, will the concentration \\\\( C(t) \\\\) at time t = T be modified compared to starting with \\\\( C_0 \\\\) without applying \\\\( f(C) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) at the beginning effectively initializes the concentration to a different value than \\\\( C_0 \\\\), specifically \\\\( e^{-k \\\\cdot 0}C_0 = C_0 \\\\). Since the function reverts the concentration to its original value immediately after application, the evolution continues as if \\\\( f(C) \\\\) was never applied, thus no change at any time t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
