  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we accurately identify if a specific filter \\\\( h(k) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), given the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), by only knowing the final output \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) and the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution property of the Fourier transform and its impact on the components influenced by the filter, multiple different filters could result in similar or even identical output states at time T, particularly without precise knowledge of intermediate states or specific characteristics of the filter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
