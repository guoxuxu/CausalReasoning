  "Problem": "Analyze a climate model where temperature (T) at time t is given by \\\\( T(t) = T_0 e^{kt} \\\\), where T_0 is initial temperature and k is a growth rate parameter. A study is performed to understand the impact of a carbon emission reduction strategy represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-rt}T(t) \\\\), where r is the rate of emission reduction.\n\nCan we deduce the initial temperature \\\\( T_0 \\\\) precisely after observing the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at time t without knowing whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the emission reduction strategy was applied, any observed temperature could arise from different initial temperatures and different values of r, leading to ambiguities in back-calculating \\\\( T_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
