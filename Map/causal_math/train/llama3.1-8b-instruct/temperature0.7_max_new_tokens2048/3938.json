  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The influence of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is analyzed under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we deduce the exact initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) encodes information about the entire evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under its differential equations but cannot uniquely specify the initial conditions without more specific constraints or additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
