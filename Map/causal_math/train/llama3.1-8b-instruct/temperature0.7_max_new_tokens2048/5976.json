  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + \\\\sin(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M(t-s)}z(s)ds \\\\) is used to investigate causal relationships.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different transformations or combinations of transformations can lead to similar or identical endpoints. Without additional context or constraints, the non-uniqueness of the solutions governed by matrix exponentials in \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) prevents a definitive determination of which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
