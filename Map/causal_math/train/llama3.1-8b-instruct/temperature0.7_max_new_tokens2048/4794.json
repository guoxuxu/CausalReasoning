  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}\\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a function of real variable t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) at a time t > 0, can we uniquely determine the parameter A, assuming no interventions have occurred and knowing that the form of z(t) was \\\\( e^{At} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\), A can be uniquely determined as the pole of the Laplace transform, provided we know the form of z(t). Once given the transform and the structure of z(t), A is the only variable that matches the location of the pole.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
