  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time and \\\\( s \\\\) the complex frequency domain. We focus on the causal effect of inversion by considering the inverse Laplace transform to recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and examining the impact of additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)\n\nIf an intervention applying a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is introduced after the initial transformation by \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be independent of the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) following \\\\( g(t) \\\\) further modifies the function, thus the ultimate Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is influenced by both initial and intervened transformations. Each transformation's effect on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), whether scaling by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) or altering exponential decay with \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), collectively determines the final form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
