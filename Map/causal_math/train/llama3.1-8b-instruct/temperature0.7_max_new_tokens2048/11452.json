  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We're interested in observing the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine accurately whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied during the evolution, just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were specifically applied from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the potential overlapping effects of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) on amplitude and phase. The transformations can produce similar results and their individual contributions to the final state cannot be isolated without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
