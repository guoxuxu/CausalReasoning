  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) that is subjected to an integral transformation defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable. This transformation transforms the function from the time domain to the frequency domain. We explore how manipulating the function directly or its transform can affect causal inference.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) = Z(s-a) \\\\), can we conclude that the time-domain function was necessarily modified by multiplying \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) for some real constant a?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of the transformation shift in frequency domain, specifically \\\\( Z'(s) = Z(s-a) \\\\), strongly indicates a multiplication by an exponential factor \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) in the time domain. This modification uniquely corresponds to this shift in Laplace transform properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
