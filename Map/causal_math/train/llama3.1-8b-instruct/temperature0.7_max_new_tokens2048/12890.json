  "Problem": "Consider a system that can be modeled using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing real and imaginary parts, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The initial condition is \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and the system evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf a new intervention in the form of a matrix exponential transformation \\\\( U(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant matrix is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the new matrix \\\\( B \\\\) and not on the earlier transformation described by \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) does not eliminate the effects of the earlier transformation \\\\( T \\\\). Thus, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the transformations represented by matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Both transformations affect the trajectory and system's evolution up to time \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
