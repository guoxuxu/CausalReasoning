  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) defined over complex numbers, and its transformation over time t using \\\\( T(p(z)) = \\\\int_0^t e^{z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nFrom knowing the value of \\\\( T(p(z)) \\\\) at \\( T \\), can we correctly infer whether the intervention \\( h(z) \\) was applied during the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the effects of the exponential function over complex numbers and their integrals, multiple scenarios (with or without \\( h(z) \\)) could lead to similar or indistinguishable results at \\( T \\). This ambiguity in potential trajectories and interactions of transformations prevents a clear deduction of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
