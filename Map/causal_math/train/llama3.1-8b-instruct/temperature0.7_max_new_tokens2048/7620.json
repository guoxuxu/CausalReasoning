  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a matrix defining system dynamics, B is a matrix defining input effects, x is the state vector, and u is the control input. We examine the system under the influence of a control transformation defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and the initial system dynamics (A and B), can we determine the specific control strategies used (whether \\\\( u = Kx \\\\), \\\\( u = Cx \\\\), or both) throughout the time interval 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple control strategies can lead to the same endpoint state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to differing effects of K and C when integrated over time. The overlapping possibilities of how K and C could influence the state vector at different times make it impossible to precisely identify the control laws used solely from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
