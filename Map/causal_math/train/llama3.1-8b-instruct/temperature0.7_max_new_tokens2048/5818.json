  "Problem": "Consider a transformation process where an initial function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[v](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2 + sx} v(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We analyze the causal inference between the input function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) and the transformed function \\\\( w(x) = T[v](x) \\\\) under various scenarios.\n\nGiven the output function \\\\( w(x) \\\\) from the transformation, can we deduce the original function \\\\( v(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the integral transformation was applied or understanding the nature of \\\\( T \\\\), the transformation can be convoluted with various plausible input functions \\\\( v(x) \\\\) producing a similar output, making it challenging to uniquely identify the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
