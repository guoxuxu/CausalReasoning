  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in the context of an operator \\( L \\) defined on a complex function space whereby \\( Lf = \\lambda f \\). We analyze the effects of altering this relation by an integral transform \\( T \\) defined by \\( (Tf)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x,t)f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a given kernel function.\n\nCan one unequivocally determine the initial function \\( f \\) and the sequence of transformations applied (\\( T \\), \\( U \\), or both) by examining the resultant function after those transformations without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential variability in the kernel functions of \\( T \\) and \\( U \\), as well as their non-commutative nature with \\( L \\), it is generally impossible to unequivocally backtrack to understand the specific transformations and original functions without more explicit information on the nature of these transforms and their effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
