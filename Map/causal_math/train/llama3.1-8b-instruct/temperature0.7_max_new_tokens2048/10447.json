  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the impact of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) over time t, where M is a complex constant.\n\nIf a new transformation described by \\\\( k(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) (where N is another complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the new state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and D, without any influence from M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds an additional layer of complexity through its own exponential factor. This results in the final state at time T being dependent on the two exponential transformations (arising from M and N), as well as the constants A and D. These transformations can lead to different magnitudes and phases in the complex plane, thereby influencing the final position significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
