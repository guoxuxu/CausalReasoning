  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\\\( u' = Du \\\\), where D is a linear operator acting on a vector space V. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation, defined by the operator \\\\( T(u) = Evu \\\\), where E is a matrix and v is a scalar, and then examining the system's response over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( M(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial transformations and interventions due to linear operator properties and potential overlapping effects. The exact sequence or type of transformations applied is not discernible solely from the final state due to the potential for different transformations to yield similar end states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
