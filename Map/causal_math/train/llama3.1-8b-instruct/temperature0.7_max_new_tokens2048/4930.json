  "Problem": "Assume a linear system of differential equations characterized by \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Nf \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( f \\\\) represents an external controlled input. The impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on the system's response is evaluated, considering different functional forms of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) that was applied from the start without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The solution space for \\\\( f(t) \\\\) leading to a particular \\\\( X(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain can include multiple potential functions, especially without explicit constraints or knowledge about the initial conditions or the particular form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Therefore, multiple different \\\\( f(t) \\\\) could lead to the same observed \\\\( X(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
