  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention at any time t_1, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected only by the constants a and b but not by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional phase rotation, thereby depending also on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since these transformations influence the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) throughout its evolution, the final state at t = T is not solely dependent on the original system constants a and b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
