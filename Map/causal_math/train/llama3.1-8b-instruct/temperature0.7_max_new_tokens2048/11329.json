  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is a kernel representing a transformation and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) where A is a constant.\n\nIf the kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) at the beginning and the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is applied, will the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as it would be under the original kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the kernel changes how the input signal is processed. The factor \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) can significantly alter the characteristics of the kernel, affecting the final output. Such a transformation might amplify, dampen, or alter the phase of components of the input signal resulting in a different output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modification of K(t) → Change in K'(t); Change in K'(t) → Change in z(t); x(t) → z(t); Change in z(t) → Difference in z(T)"
