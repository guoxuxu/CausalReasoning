  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a dynamic process in the complex plane. The function is initially transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. Then, the system evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Bz \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which interventions (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, knowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from just the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the evolution matrix \\\\( B \\\\) is challenging because multiple intervention sequences (with different A, C parameters) could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to how matrix exponential transformations can overlap or differ in their effects. The problem of inference is under-determined without additional constraints or information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
