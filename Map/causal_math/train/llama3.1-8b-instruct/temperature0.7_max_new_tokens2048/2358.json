  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing R(t) at t = T without knowing if transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the initial application of \\\\( T(w) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as both A and B could have altered it significantly. Identifying the original function would require knowledge of the parameters A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
