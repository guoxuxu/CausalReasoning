  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nIf at any point in time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(x) = x(t) - e^{bt} \\\\) is applied, where b is a constant different from a, will the output at any subsequent time point T exclusively depend on the original convolution settings and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces another modification to the input signal which influences subsequent convolution results. Both modifications \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) reshape the input in ways which cumulatively affect the output signal thereby impacting the overall system response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
