  "Problem": "Let's examine a complex function scenario given by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces a unit circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We are interested in the effect of a transformation using another function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied to this time-varying function.\n\nGiven the trajectory \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at some time T, can we conclusively determine whether the path started from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z_0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) transforms the angular component differently, knowing only the resulting position \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at time T does not uniquely indicate whether the starting point was transformed. The ambiguity arises from multiple possible initial states leading to the same observed effect due to the periodic nature of the functions involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
