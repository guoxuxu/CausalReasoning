  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nDoes the function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), result in the same endpoint at time T as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without the square function?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), which means the base trajectory is different. The evolution of \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) results in \\\\( (e^{iwt}z_0)^2 \\\\), not \\\\( e^{iwt}z_0^2 \\\\). These are generally not equivalent due to the properties and behavior of exponentials and powers in complex numbers.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
