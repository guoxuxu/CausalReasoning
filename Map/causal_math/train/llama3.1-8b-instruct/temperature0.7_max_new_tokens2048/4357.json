  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the resulting function is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the time evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to if the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and the evolution \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\) will maintain the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Hence the Fourier transform remains unaltered over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
