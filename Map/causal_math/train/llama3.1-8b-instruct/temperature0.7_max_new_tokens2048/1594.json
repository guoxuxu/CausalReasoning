  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the Laplace transform of its impulse response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The behavior of the circuit is impacted by alternating the parameters of its elements, such as resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C). Let's analyze how variations in these parameters, modeled as a complex function \\\\\\( f(R, L, C) = RLCs^2 + (R+L)s + C \\\\\\), influence the overall impulse response over time domain, represented by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\\\( H(s) \\\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original values of R, L, and C after observing the impulse response at t = T without knowing initial settings?",
  "Explanation": "An impulse response observed at t = T may correspond to multiple configurations of R, L, and C due to the nature of inverse problems in system identification being generally non-unique without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
