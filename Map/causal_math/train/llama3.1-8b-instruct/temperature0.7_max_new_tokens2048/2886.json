  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). We explore the effect of a convolution operation where \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another time-domain function and the corresponding Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf only the function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is known, can it unequivocally determine the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) independently without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) only provides the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without additional constraints or knowledge about one of the functions, there are potentially multiple pairs \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that could result in the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
