  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system's evolution is governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a positive real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine if there was an intervention altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios (varying times and magnitudes of interventions) can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), even with a constant original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The final state alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine if or when the frequency was altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
