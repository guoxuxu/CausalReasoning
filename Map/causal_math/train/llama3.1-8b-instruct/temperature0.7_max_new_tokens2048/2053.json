  "Problem": "Examine the application of Laplace transforms in a control system where an input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\). The system's response \\\\( X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) represents the complex frequency domain, is dictated by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The analysis focuses on the behavior of the system under different transformations and interventions.\n\nAssuming the Laplace transform of the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and applied to a system with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the system's output response \\\\( X(s) \\\\) in the frequency domain be defined exclusively by \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any interference or additional transformations, the output response \\\\( X(s) = H(s) U(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain is determined entirely by the Laplace transform of the input and the system's transfer function, as dictated by the convolution theorem and the properties of linear time-invariant systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
