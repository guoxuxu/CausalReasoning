  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the integral transform \\( I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant complex function. This scenario explores how varying \\( s \\) and operations on \\( f(t) \\) affects the transformation result.\n\nGiven the output \\( I(s) \\), can one determine the initial function \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) correctly without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the parameter \\( A \\) in the function \\( e^{At} \\), and considering that various forms of \\( A \\) can yield overlapping or indeterminate results in \\( I(s) \\), it is not feasible to uniquely reverse infer \\( f(t) \\) from \\( I(s) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
