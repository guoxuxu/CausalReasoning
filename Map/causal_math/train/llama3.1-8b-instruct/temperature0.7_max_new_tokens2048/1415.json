  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to periodic external force, modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = f(t)\\\\) where p and q are constants and \\\\(f(t)\\\\) represents the forcing term. We examine the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) to the state x, where A is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( h(x) = Bx^3 \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the characteristics of the periodic forcing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on the transformations by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions \\\\( g(x) = Ax^2 \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) = Bx^3 \\\\) introduce additional complexity into the system's dynamics, affecting the trajectory and the state at time T. These transformations influence the system's response to the forcing term, making the outcome dependent not just on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), but also significantly on A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
