  "Problem": "We investigate the influence of a function transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + v \\\\) within the context of a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and v is a constant complex transformation vector.\n\nGiven the final outcome \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) after the transformation and evolution, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), i.e., the squaring and shifting operation, any attempt to retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) is ambiguous. Multiple potential candidates for \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could result in the same \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\), especially given the nonlinear nature of the transformation and evolution functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
