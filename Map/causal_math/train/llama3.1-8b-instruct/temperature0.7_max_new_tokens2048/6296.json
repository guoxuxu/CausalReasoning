  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and analyze its transformation under the Laplace transform. Assume that the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) for \\\\( Re(s) > 1 \\\\).\n\nGiven only the modified Laplace transform results from an intervened function, can the specific intervention (e.g., applying \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\)) be identified without prior knowledge of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific intervention applied to the original function, the resultant Laplace transform output cannot definitively indicate the specific function (e.g., \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\)) that was used. Multiple different interventions could result in similar or indistinguishable Laplace transform characteristics, preventing definitive identification of the intervention solely based on transformation results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
