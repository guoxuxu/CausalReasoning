  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a real variable z. We are analyzing the treatment effect of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(f)(z) = \\int_0^z f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we accurately identify whether the transformation \\\\( G \\\\) was applied during the integration process by just examining the endpoint \\\\( T(f)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of a modified function could potentially result in the same value as that of an unmodified function, especially when dealing with complex functions and transformations. Therefore, the outcome at \\\\( T(f)(T) \\\\) could be identical for different transformation histories, making it uncertain whether \\\\( G \\\\) was applied or not without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
