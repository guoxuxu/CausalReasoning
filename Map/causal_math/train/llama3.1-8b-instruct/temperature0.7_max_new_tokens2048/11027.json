  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) a constant vector. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a different constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) introduces another modification to the system, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on all three matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). The resulting state at any point is influenced by the accumulative effects of the transformations due to compositions with evolving time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
