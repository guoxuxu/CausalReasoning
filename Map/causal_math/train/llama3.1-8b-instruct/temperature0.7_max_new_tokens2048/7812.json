  "Problem": "In the context of control theory, consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the state-space equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is the input matrix. We examine how the integral transformation defined by \\\\( x_{new}(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) impacts the system's behavior with respect to input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we conclusively identify if and when an intervention on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) occurred by observing just the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at some endpoint T?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) reflects an accumulation of influences from both the system dynamics and input history, including any interventions. Without additional information about the precise nature and time of interventions or the state trajectory, it's not possible to pinpoint interventions solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
