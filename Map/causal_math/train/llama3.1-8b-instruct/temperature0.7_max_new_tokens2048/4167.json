  "Problem": "Investigate a linear system governed by \\\\( dX = NX dt + M dW_t \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Wiener process (Brownian motion). We hypothesize a transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Kt} X \\\\) applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(X) = e^{Lt}X \\\\) (where \\\\( L \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of the system \\\\( X(T) \\\\), for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\), depend only on \\\\( N \\\\) and not on \\\\( K \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( q(X) = e^{Lt}X \\\\) as an intervention modifies how the initial and subsequent behavior of the system evolves under the stochastic influences and matrix interactions. Both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) will impact the trajectory and thus the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\), alongside the dynamics induced by \\\\( N \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
