  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation and its ability to highlight causality within the calculations.\n\nIf, during the transformation process, a modification \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) is applied at a certain s-value, will this intervention solely determine the resulting value of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at that point?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the modification \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) during the transformation process introduces a new dynamic to the function, fundamentally altering the output of the Laplace transform. The resulting \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is now a combination influenced by both the original function and the intervention, proving that the outcome depends on multiple factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
