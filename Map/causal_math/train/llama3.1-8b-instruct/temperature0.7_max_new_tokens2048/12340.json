  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nDoes applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\) and then allowing the system to evolve without further action yield a frequency spectrum centered solely at \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\), \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\xi) \\). Without further action, the spectrum remains centered at \\( \\omega \\), indicating a frequency component solely at \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
