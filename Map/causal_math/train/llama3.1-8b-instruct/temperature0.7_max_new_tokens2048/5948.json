  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario involving integral transformations. Let \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be a holomorphic function in a region \\\\( R \\\\). We examine the effect of transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_C K(z, s) f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\) is a kernel function also holomorphic in some domain of \\\\( R \\\\).\n\nIf we have the output function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) after transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\), can we deduce what specific transformations were applied and in what sequence, just based on \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations and their sequence from the final function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alone is usually infeasible due to the potential overlap and the interplay between multiple transformation possibilities. Without additional information about either the kernels \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), or the contours \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), the original operations remain undetermined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
