  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a mechanical system governed by the Laplace-transformed equation \\\\(L{\\\\ddot{x} + k\\\\dot{x} + mx} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\), and \\\\(m\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is the Laplace transform of a force function. We investigate the effects of applying different inverse transformations representing procedural changes.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any time t, can we uniquely determine the force function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the initial conditions or any parameters (k and m)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of constants \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(m\\\\), and the initial conditions (initial displacement and velocity), there could be multiple possible force functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) that would produce the same displacement due to the differential equation’s dependency on these parameters and conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
