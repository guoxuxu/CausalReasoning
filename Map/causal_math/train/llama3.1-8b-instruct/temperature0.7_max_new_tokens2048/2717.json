  "Problem": "The scenario involves the eigenvalue problem in the evolution of a system under transformation. Given a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix, we examine its effects on the dynamics modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and allowed to evolve under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) without further modifications, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), attain the same values as if only the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) fundamentally modifies the initial conditions by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into a fundamentally different state in the complex plane. The transformation caused by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) impacts the trajectory in a way that uniquely alters how the state evolves over time compared to the untransformed differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
