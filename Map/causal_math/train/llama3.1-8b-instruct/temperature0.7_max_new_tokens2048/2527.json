  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), defined on a bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions. We focus on the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{pt}v(x) \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) solves the Laplace equation.\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) modifying \\\\( u \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t_1, x) = e^{qt_1}v(x) \\\\) where \\\\( q \\\\) is a different complex number, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) still reflect the original function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) modified by initial and intervention parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the exponential scaling, changing it from \\\\( e^{pt_1} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{qt_1} \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform at any later time \\\\( T \\\\) will be a compound effect of both the initial and intervention easing factors on \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\), specifically reflecting the changes due to \\\\( p \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
