  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-2\\pi ist}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the variable s.\n\nIf an operation alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such that \\\\( z(t) = a \\cdot e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) with a constant scalar a before applying the Fourier transform, will the position of the peak in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a constant scalar \\\\( a \\\\) affects the amplitude but not the frequency of the function. Thus, the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will still peak at \\\\( s = \\omega / (2\\pi) \\\\). This demonstrates that scaling the input merely affects amplitude and does not displace the frequency components in the Fourier transform domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
