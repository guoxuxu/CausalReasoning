  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the use of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iSt} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where S is a complex constant, to modify z(t).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates z(t) over time with a complex exponential factor, back-calculating to the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible without explicit knowledge of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)'s application, due to potential alterations in both magnitude and phase shifts in the complex plane.",
