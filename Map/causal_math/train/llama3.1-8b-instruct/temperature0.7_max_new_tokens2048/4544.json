  "Problem": "Let’s analyze a complex dynamic system governed by a Cauchy problem involving Fourier transforms, defined by \\\\( u'(t) = A \\\\cdot \\mathcal{F}(u(t)) + B \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a function of time t, \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) denotes the Fourier transform.\n\nCan we precisely determine the nature of any interventions (e.g., their type and timing) from the observed state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could result from various interventions or a range of initial conditions and parameter settings. Without additional information regarding the intervening activities or changes in the parameters, it is not feasible to accurately back-calculate to identify specific interventions solely based on the resulting state at \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
