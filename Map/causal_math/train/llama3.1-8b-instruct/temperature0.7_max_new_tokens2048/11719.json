  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{z} \\) acting over the complex plane, where transformations are applied via complex integral transformations such as the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\). The system explores changes in the complex function domain and their propagation through the transformation.\n\nIf a corrective transformation, \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), is applied at a certain point to modify \\( f(z) \\) before taking \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\), does the outcome of the Laplace transform exclusively depend on the original \\( f(z) \\) without considering \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(z) \\) fundamentally changes \\( f(z) \\) by altering its form to \\( e^{z^2} \\) before the transform is applied. The results of \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\) will therefore incorporate the effects of \\( g(z) \\), reflecting the modified behavior of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
