  "Problem": "Consider an iterative linear system transformation defined by the equation \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) applied periodically over discrete time steps t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x_N \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x_N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x_N \\\\) alone does not contain sufficient information to uniquely identify the sequence or types of interventions applied. This is due to the potential for overlapping effects from the matrix transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), which can deliver similar transformations to the endpoint under different operational timelines and methods.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
