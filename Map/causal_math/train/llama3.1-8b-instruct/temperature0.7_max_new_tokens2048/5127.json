  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network involving a complex impedance function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where s is the complex frequency, and a, b, c are constants. An impulse response h(t) of this network is obtained through the inverse Laplace transform of Z(s).\n\nIf after applying an external control that modifies parameters 'b' and 'c' at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), enhancing the system damping, will the impulse response h(t) at T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still reveal the original effect of parameter 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "While the system's overall response h(t) is affected by the changes in 'b' and 'c', the distinct contribution of 'a' to the impulse response's initial conditions and characteristics (like initial phase) can still be seen, provided that the effects of parameter 'a' are not completely suppressed by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
