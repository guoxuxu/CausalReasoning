  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of a holomorphic transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is considered over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega T} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) results in \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), changing the trajectory of evolution. The new initial condition will affect the resultant state at any time T due to the squared amplification effect, distinct from merely evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to T under the original system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
