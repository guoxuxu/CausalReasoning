  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional operator \\( Q(D) \\) affecting \\( z(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\), will the final frequency response \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) be solely determined by the initial \\( P(D) \\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( Q(D) \\) introduces an additional influence on the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), affecting how \\( z(t) \\) transitions from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\). This results in a modification of the frequency spectrum at \\( T \\), making \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) dependent on both \\( P(D) \\) and \\( Q(D) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
