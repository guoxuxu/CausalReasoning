  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\) acting on a complex function \\( x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We examine the consequences of applying an Integral transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) over time t.\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) is applied to a function \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0, and then the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is applied without further intervention, will \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) be the same as if \\( x_0(t) \\) was directly transformed under \\( \\mathcal{L} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation via \\( z(t) \\) modifies \\( x(t) \\) by a factor \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\), which alters the frequency components of \\( x(t) \\). The Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) thus yields a result shifted in the s-plane by \\( i\\omega \\), compared to \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
