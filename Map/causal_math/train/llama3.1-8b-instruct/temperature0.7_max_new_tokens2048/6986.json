  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setup where an initial complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) undergoes a series of transformations defined by the Laplace Transform followed by an Inverse Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) respectively. The transformations affect the function over the complex plane based on transformation parameters.\n\nCan we clearly deduce the initial form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) after it has been transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( z(s) \\\\) satisfies the conditions for the Laplace Transform and its inverse, and if no alteration or loss of information occurs during the transformations, one should be able to deduce the original function post the described sequence definitively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
