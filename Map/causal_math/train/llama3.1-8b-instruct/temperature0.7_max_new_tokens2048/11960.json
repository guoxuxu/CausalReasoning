  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) where S is a constant matrix. The impact of the complex function \\\\( h(x) = e^{iDt}x \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t=T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t=T under \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{iDt}x_0 \\\\) at t=0. This transformed initial condition evolves differently under the system \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) unless D and S commute. The complex exponential can alter the trajectory and phase, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
