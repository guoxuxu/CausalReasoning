  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing its transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T without any earlier knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z)(t) \\\\) results in an integral that blends the effects of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T, obscuring direct information about the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) unless additional constraints or information about \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
