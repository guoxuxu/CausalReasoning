  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another modifying factor. Therefore, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interactions of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), making the state at T an outcome influenced by all these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
