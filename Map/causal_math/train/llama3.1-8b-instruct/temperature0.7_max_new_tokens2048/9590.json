  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which transcribes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation is applied, such as \\\\( T[f](t)=\\\\int_0^t f(s) e^{s} ds \\\\), affecting the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nCan we solely from observing the transformed state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without knowing the specific transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), which involves the integration of \\\\( e^{it}e^{t} \\\\), does not retain clear features of the original function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), such as the periodic unit circle motion, making it impossible to deduce the original function without prior knowledge of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
