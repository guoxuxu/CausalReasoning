  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts evolving over time t governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\) where P and Q are complex constants. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z dt \\\\) where S is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine precisely what transformations or interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on the knowledge of the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from different combinations of transformations and interventions. The presence of overlapping influence from P, S, and U and their integration within the system dynamics obscures clear differentiation of which transformations or interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
