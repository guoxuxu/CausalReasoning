  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\) and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the Fourier transformation defined by \\( F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\), where \\( \\omega \\) represents angular frequency.\n\nIf a specific \\( z(t) \\) function, say \\( z(t) = e^t \\), is transformed using the Fourier transform, will \\( F(z(t)) \\) at \\( \\omega = 1 \\) be same for any \\( t \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( e^t \\) for \\( \\omega = 1 \\) is a standard result that does not depend on the specific instance of time \\( t \\). It treats the function globally over the entire time domain rather than at specific instances, resulting in a consistent transform output for any \\( t \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
