  "Problem": "Suppose we analyze the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}x + \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. This system reflects the solution to a linear time-invariant dynamic system with input.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) and the control path \\\\( u(t) \\\\) over [0, T] without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The linear superposition principle allows multiple combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that might yield the same state at time T, particularly when the matrices A and B provide non-unique system responses due to their properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
