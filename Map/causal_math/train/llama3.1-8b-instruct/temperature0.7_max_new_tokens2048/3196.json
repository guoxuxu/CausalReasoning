  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving a circuit with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and two components: a resistor with resistance R and a capacitor with capacitance C. The input voltage across the circuit can be described by the function \\\\( u(t) = U_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and we are interested in analyzing the output voltage across the capacitor \\\\( v(t) \\\\) using the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the output voltage properties (such as amplitude and phase) at time T, can we unambiguously determine whether a filter was added during the experiment, assuming all frequencies are possible?",
  "Explanation": "The existence of potentially equivalent phase and amplitude changes through variations in \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or filter characteristics (such as phase adjustment or attenuative properties) contributes to an ambiguity in determining the precise nature and timing of interventions solely based on the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
