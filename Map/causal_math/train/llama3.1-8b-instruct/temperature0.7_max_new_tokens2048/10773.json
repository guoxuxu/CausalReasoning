  "Problem": "A mechanical system's position as a function of time is determined by the integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p(t) \\\\dot{x} + q(t)x = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are given functions. We analyze the impact of a control intervention defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = x + ct^2 \\\\) where c is a constant.\n\nIf the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(0) \\\\) are set, and then the system is allowed to evolve under the given equation without further intervention, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the system started with modified initial conditions via the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions, which would alter the trajectory of the system. Since the initial position is modified by a quadratic function of time, the subsequent dynamics determined by the integro-differential equation will diverge from those of the unaltered initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
