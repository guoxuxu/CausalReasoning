  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), representing a rotating vector in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The effect of an external transformation is considered using the operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) with \\\\( a \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using the transformation \\\\( M(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( M(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional factors that affect the state at time \\\\( T \\\\). The resultant state depends on \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( w \\\\), due to the compound influences of both initial and intervention transformations modulating the trajectory and phase of the vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
