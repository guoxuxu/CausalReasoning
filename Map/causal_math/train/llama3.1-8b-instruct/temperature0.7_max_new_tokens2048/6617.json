  "Problem": "Analyze a system where the temperature distribution along the line, u(x,t), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where k is the diffusivity constant. We consider the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\), where v is a constant scalar added at a specific time t.\n\nIf \\\\(g(u)\\\\) is applied to a temperature distribution \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was directly allowed to evolve to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\) alters the initial temperature profile by uniformly increasing each point's temperature by v. This change in initial conditions modifies the temperature distribution evolution, leading to a different profile at time T. The uniform shift in initial temperature affects the solution's entire trajectory under the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
