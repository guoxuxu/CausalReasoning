  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) (where \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency) applied to a signal transformation described by the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{s(t)\\\\} = S(\\\\omega) \\\\). We examine the impact of modifying the frequency component by multiplying the original signal by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) from the transformed spectrum \\\\( S'(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the specific \\\\( z(t) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum \\\\( S'(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a frequency-shifted view of the original spectrum \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), which corresponds to multiple potential shifts corresponding to different \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) values in \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), the original signal's form cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
