  "Problem": "Consider a closed curve C in the complex plane and a function f(z) which is holomorphic inside and on C, except for isolated singularities inside C. We examine the effect of applying the contour integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int_C f(z) dz \\\\) which computes the residues of the function at its singularities.\n\nWill applying g(f) to a function f(z) with known singularities give the same result as directly summing the residues of the singularities inside C without transforming by g(f)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying g(f) as described computes the residues of f at its singularities, which by the residue theorem, is precisely the sum of the residues at those points. Hence, applying g(f) achieves the same result as directly summing the residues of the singularities inside C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
