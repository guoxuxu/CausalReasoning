  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified by a transformation using a Laplace transform with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to the already transformed signal, will the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for t > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be independent of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alters the characteristics of the transfer function affecting the path of the signal. Thus, the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) becomes a product of both the original and the intervened transformations, making it dependent on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) as well as \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
