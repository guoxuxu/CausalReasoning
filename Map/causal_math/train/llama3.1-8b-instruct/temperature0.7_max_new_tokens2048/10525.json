  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) is used to solve the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = f(t) \\\\). The transform function is applied to both sides leading to an algebraic equation in the complex domain.\n\nDoes solving the transformed equation and applying the inverse Laplace transform bring back the effect \\\\( y(t) \\\\) identical to the one that would result from directly solving the differential equation with the same initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform method and its inverse are mathematically designed to preserve the equivalence between the transformed domain and time domain solutions under the same initial conditions. Therefore, solving the differential equation directly or via the Laplace transform should yield the same result for \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
