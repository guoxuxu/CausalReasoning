  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied initially to \\\\(x\\\\) so that the initial condition becomes \\\\(z_0 = Ux\\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) equal \\\\(e^{TA}x\\\\) when calculated without the application of \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) changes the initial state, which affects the entire evolution of the system under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\). Since \\\\(U\\\\) is unitary, it preserves the norm but can modify eigenvector directions, thus leading to a different endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) compared to just evolving \\\\(x\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
