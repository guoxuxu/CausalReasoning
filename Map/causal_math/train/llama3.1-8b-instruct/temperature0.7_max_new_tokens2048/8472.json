  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) \\) evolving over time according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\) applied at different time points.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely the transformations that were used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) just by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the final state \\( z(T) \\) is difficult given that multiple combinations of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\), with varying application times, can lead to the same endpoint due to their phase-manipulating nature. These transformations can overlap in effects and alters the trajectory in ways that are non-distinguishable at the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
