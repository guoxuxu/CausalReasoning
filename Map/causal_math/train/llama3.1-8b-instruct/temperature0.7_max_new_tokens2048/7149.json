  "Problem": "Analyzing a scenario where Z is a complex function defined as \\\\(Z(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t) \\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is a function that represents a system's response. We are interested in how changes in the real or imaginary part of \\\\(z\\\\) influence \\\\(Z(z)\\\\), and how interventions through transformational functions could affect the outputs.\n\nIf the real part of \\\\(z\\\\) is increased, will this always decrease the magnitude of \\\\(Z(z)\\\\) based on the integral transformation without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the real part of \\\\(z\\\\) effectively increases the rate of exponential decay within the integral formula for \\\\(Z(z)\\\\). This typically reduces the integral's magnitude since the function inside the integral, \\\\(e^{-zt} h(t)\\\\), decays faster, lessening the overall contribution over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
