  "Problem": "Evaluate the real part of the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a, b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(t\\\\) is the time variable. We explore an integral transformation by applying Laplace transform on this complex function.\n\nIf an additional phase shift by \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) degrees is introduced to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, does it depend only on the original constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a phase shift modifies the function to \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}e^{i\\\\phi}\\\\), which changes the Laplace transform to \\\\(\\\\frac{e^{i\\\\phi}}{s-a-bi}\\\\). This transformation ensures that the result depends on the additional phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), not solely on \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
