  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane as \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number. This function is being transformed by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) defined such that \\\\(L(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), which resembles the Laplace transform but over a modified domain.\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\\\) (with \\\\(\\alpha > 0\\\\)) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before applying operator \\\\(L\\\\), will the transformed result \\\\(L(z)\\\\) be finite?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\(e^{-(s + \\alpha) t}e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), which aids in convergence by providing an exponential decay regardless of \\\\(\\omega\\\\). Thus, L now effectively computes a Laplace-like transform of a decaying exponential function, ensuring convergence.",
