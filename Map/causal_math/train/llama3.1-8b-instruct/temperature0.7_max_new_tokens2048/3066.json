  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the lack of knowledge about the application of \\( g(z) \\), the integration involving \\( D \\) modifies the trajectory in a manner that may not be reversible, particularly if \\( D \\) and \\( C \\) have different eigenvalues or do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
