  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C h(w) dw \\\\) after applying the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\), can we determine with certainty whether the initial function applied was \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral result, even after applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\), will not uniquely indicate whether the initial function was \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\). This uncertainty arises because the replacement of g by h removes any trace of the initial function's effects on the outcome, considering both are entire and the attributes of e are unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
