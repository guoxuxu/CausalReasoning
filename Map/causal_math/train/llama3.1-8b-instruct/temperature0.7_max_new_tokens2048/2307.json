  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = cos(x) + i sin(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let us examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( z(x) t= e^tx \\\\) on this complex function over a time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial function and not on the intervention or original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + 1 \\\\) will alter the trajectory of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( z(x, T) = cos(e^T (x + 1)) + i sin(e^T (x + 1)) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\). This shows that the final state is dependent on the nature of both the initial exponential transformation and the intervening linear shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
