  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is initially governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then the system evolves naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t still follow the trajectory as if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z(0) \\\\). This alteration affects the evolution path of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) as they are scaled differently due to the real and imaginary components of C, leading to a trajectory distinct from the untransformed one.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
