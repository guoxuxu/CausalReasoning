  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over an interval [0, t].\n\nGiven the transformed state at \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over the interval [0, T] without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates the function with a decay factor \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\) which masks the details of the original function, particularly phases and amplitudes at different times. Reconstructive analysis solely from \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is generally not feasible without prior knowledge of behavioral changes at each moment within the interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
