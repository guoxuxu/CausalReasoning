  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We examine how manipulating the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) through multiplication by \\\\( t^n \\\\) affects its transform and the inverse process.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( t^n f(t) \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform, will the resultant transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the same as calculated from the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( t^n \\\\) and then applying the Laplace transform results in a different transform, specifically involving derivatives of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) up to \\\\( n \\\\)th order according to the properties of the Laplace transform of \\\\( t^n f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Manipulation of f(t) → Change in function form; Change in function form → t^n f(t); t^n f(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → F(s); s → t^n f(t); s → F(s)"
