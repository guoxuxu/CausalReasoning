  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right) + q(x)y = \\\\lambda w(x)y \\\\), where \\\\( p(x), q(x), w(x) \\\\) are given functions and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is the eigenvalue. An integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} k(x, t)y(t)dt \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nGiven the observed function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function before applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation, generally speaking, does not guarantee invertibility without specific conditions on the kernel \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\). Without knowing these properties or having additional information about the initial conditions, reconstructing the original function is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
