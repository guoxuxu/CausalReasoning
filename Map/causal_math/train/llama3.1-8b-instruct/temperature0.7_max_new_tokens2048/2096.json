  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0 \\\\), with p(t) and q(t) being continuous functions of time t. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation applied to y(t), specifically looking at the transformed function \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) derived after the intervention at T, can the exact nature of the interventions (specific forms of r(t) and s(t)) be determined only from \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the altered transform \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) carries information about the changes in system dynamics due to the intervention, it generally does not contain enough specificity to precisely and uniquely identify the functional forms of r(t) and s(t) unless additional constraints or data are provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
