  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of the operator \\\\( F(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where K is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the transformation matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nIf \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( F(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state by applying \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Kt}S \\\\), which changes the system's trajectory. The dynamics are driven by both matrices D and K through the transformation, resulting in a state at time T that differs from that obtained by evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
