  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of the system is analyzed when a transformation through a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) represented by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Lz \\\\) is introduced.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be accurately determined after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Not knowing whether the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied poses an ambiguity. Since \\\\( L \\\\) can fundamentally alter \\\\( z_0 \\\\), identifying the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without this knowledge is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
