  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the continuous mapping of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a real constant, and z represents a complex variable. This function is then subjected to a transformation via a linear operator T that acts as an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} e^{st} f(1-s) ds \\\\), where c and s are complex variables and t is a real parameter.\n\nIf a new operation, defined by \\\\( g(f) = e^{bz}f(z) \\\\) where b is a new real constant, is introduced as an intervention at some time t = t1, will the function at time t = T (where T > t1) depend solely on the initial function without considering the effects of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(f) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic to the system via another exponential modification, making the final function at t = T dependent on both the original transformation by T and the intervention, altering the trajectory and output of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
