  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a linear transformation on a complex function. Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, representing a unit circle in the complex plane. The transformation given is \\\\( T(z) = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, and given the fact that \\\\( k \\\\) can be any real number, multiple original states could correspond to the same observed state at time T. Specifically, both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( kz_0 \\\\) could evolve to the same \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if the transformation adjusts the magnitude appropriately.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
