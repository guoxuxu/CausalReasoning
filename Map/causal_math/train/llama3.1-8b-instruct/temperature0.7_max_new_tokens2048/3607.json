  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is a constant different from \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be only dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive interventions with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) add layers of complexity due to exponential scaling factors affecting both the magnitude and the trajectory phase. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\beta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
