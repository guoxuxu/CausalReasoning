  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) follow the differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the trajectory of z over time t.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), multiple combinations of interventions (\\( f(z) \\\\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) and their timings could result in the same final state due to non-commutative and overlapping transformation effects. This complexity makes it impossible to uniquely decipher the interventions based solely on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
