  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(S(z) = e^{-i\\\\gamma t}z(t)\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(S(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) modifies the original function by applying a further frequency shift. This leads to a compound effect involving both the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the intervention frequency \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), making the result of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) dependent on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
