  "Problem": "Consider the field of Complex Functions and Integral Transforms, specifically focusing on the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The initial function is \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined for \\\\( t \\\\geq 0 \\\\). Suppose we apply the Laplace Transform to derive \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), and examine scenarios where various operations or interventions are applied, such as modifying the function or applying inverse transformations.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is squared to form \\\\( f(t)^2 \\\\) and then the Laplace Transform is applied, will the result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)^2\\\\}(s) \\\\) be the same as squaring the original transform result \\\\( F(s) \\\\) so \\\\( F(s)^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of a product of functions is not generally the product of their transforms due to convolution properties and interaction of variables within the integral, hence \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)^2\\\\}(s) \\\\) is not equal to \\\\( F(s)^2 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
