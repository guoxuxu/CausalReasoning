  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its impact when integrated over a contour in the complex plane. The contour described by the path \\\\( C \\\\) is parameterized by \\\\( z(t) = a + te^{it} \\\\) for \\\\( t \\\\) ranging from 0 to 2\\\\pi, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the value of the integral of \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) over a contour \\\\( C \\\\), can we determine the specific path or parameters (such as \\\\( a \\\\)) of \\\\( C \\\\) just from the integral value?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral can depend on both the specific path taken and the complex function characteristics. Similar integral values might result from different paths or parameters, making it infeasible to uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) just from the integral value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
