  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), with a constant complex number \\\\( s \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the specific transformations used based on the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated by the complex operators and their integrals. The overlap in potential state trajectories influenced by \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) in the complex plane introduces ambiguity, making it impossible to determine the interventions uniquely or their specific parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
