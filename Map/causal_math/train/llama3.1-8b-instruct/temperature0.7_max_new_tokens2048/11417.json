  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nIf the function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is convoluted with \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) to form \\\\( p_{new}(x) = p(x) * G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) and then Fourier transformed, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(p_{new}(x)) \\\\) strictly retain the characteristic frequencies of \\\\( F(p(x)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with a Gaussian kernel acts as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain. Although the basic frequencies of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) will still be present, their amplitudes will be altered (generally reduced), meaning the strict retention of characteristic frequencies is not guaranteed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
