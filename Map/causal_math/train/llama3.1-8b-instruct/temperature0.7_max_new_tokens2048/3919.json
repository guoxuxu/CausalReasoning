  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) applied in a calculus context on a closed contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of various transformations and integrations of the function over the contour.\n\nIf the function is modified by an intervention where \\\\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\\\) is applied mid-calculation, does the end result of the integral over \\\\( C \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new function introduced by the intervention, \\\\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\\\), changes the nature of the integral calculations. This intervention alters the integrand throughout the contour, influencing the final integral result and making it dependent not only on the original function but also on the new function applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
