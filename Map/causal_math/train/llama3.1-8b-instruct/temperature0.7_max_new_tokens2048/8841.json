  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -kx\\\\), with a constant decay rate k. The impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\(L[f(t)](s)\\\\) on this system is explored, where \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\). The transformation variable s is complex.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation is applied to the function \\\\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\\\) at t = 0 and then the inverse transformation is performed, will the system's behavior for \\\\(x(t)\\\\) between t = 0 and t = T be the same as if the transformations were not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation and its inverse are mathematical tools that do not alter the physical system's behavior or dynamics. Applying the Laplace transformation followed by the inverse Laplace transformation essentially recovers the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), leaving the system unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k → decay rate; decay rate → dx/dt; dx/dt → x(t); x(t) → f(t); f(t) → Laplace transformation; Laplace transformation → x(t); t → T; x_0 → x(t); k → s; s → Laplace transformation"
