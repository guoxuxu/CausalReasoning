  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane function defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{f(z)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(z) = az^2 + bz + c \\\\) and a, b, c are complex numbers. Investigate the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = dz + e \\\\) on z, where d and e are also complex numbers, on the mapping of the function w.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied without any further changes, will \\\\( w(T(z_0)) \\\\) at any given \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) under \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the input to the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( w(dz_0 + e) \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( w(z_0) \\\\) due to the non-linearity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
