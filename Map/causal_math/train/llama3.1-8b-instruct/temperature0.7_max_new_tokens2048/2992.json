  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)} \\), can we conclusively determine both the original function \\( z(t) \\) and the intervention \\( e^{ct} \\) solely based on this transform?",
  "Explanation": "The modified transform indicates a pole shift but does not provide unique information about the components of this shift. While it suggests alterations involving both \\( a \\) and \\( c \\), without knowing one of these values explicitly, the precise form of the original \\( z(t) \\) and the exact intervention \\( e^{ct} \\) cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
