  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of complex functions, where each function obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. We explore how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}u(x)dx\\\\), influences the solutions.\n\nCan we recover the exact initial conditions of \\\\(u(x)\\\\) from its Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s)\\\\) if we don't know the form of \\\\(u(x)\\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides information about the general form of the solution, but specific details about boundary conditions or the exact formulation of \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at specific points require additional information. The Laplace transform does not retain localized spatial information in its standard form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
