  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = F(x, y) \\\\) that maps complex numbers \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( F(x, y) = x^2 + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( F \\\\) and its derivatives across transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(x, y) = (e^{Ax}x, e^{By}y) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( F \\\\) is applied to complex numbers \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) without any transformations and then the resultant \\\\( z \\\\) is directly evolved under the transformation \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( z \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) was first transformed and then \\\\( F \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( F \\\\) interacts nonlinearly with the components \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). Transforming \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) using \\\\( e^{Ax} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{By} \\\\) before applying \\\\( F \\\\) results in a different outcome than transforming the outcome of \\\\( F \\\\) directly. Non-linear combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) with exponential functions alter the results significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
