  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\). We analyze the behavior of its integral transformation using the Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without any modification to the function, will the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) at s = 2 reflect the original properties of \\\\( z(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform modifies the function by integrating it with the exponential decay factored by s, altering its original properties and behavior. For specific values of s, such as s = 2, the output does not retain all original characteristics of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) due to transformation dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
