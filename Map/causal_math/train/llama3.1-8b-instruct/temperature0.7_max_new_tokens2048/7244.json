  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) with a delta function at a specific frequency, can we determine whether an intervention (frequency shift by \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)) was applied and identify the value of \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) just by observing \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function at a certain frequency in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) only informs us about the effective frequency in the transformed function. Without prior information, it is impossible to confirm whether this frequency resulted from an intervention (such as a shift by \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)) or was the inherent frequency of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
