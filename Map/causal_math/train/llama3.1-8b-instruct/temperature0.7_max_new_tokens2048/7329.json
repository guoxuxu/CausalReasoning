  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined on the complex plane. We evaluate the responses to integrations involving the complex function and the related impacts given by the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve without further modification, will the result of \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at t = 1 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 1?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares the complex number, changing both magnitude and argument differently than the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\), which rotates the number in the complex plane without altering the magnitude. Thus, the results at t = 1 are fundamentally different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
