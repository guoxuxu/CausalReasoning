  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects and reversibility of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using an inverse transformation, specifically inverse Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\), is applied, will the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 only depend on the original differential system defined by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Laplace transformation as an intervention modifies the state back into its original domain (time domain) but does not erase the history or effects of the initial Laplace transformation and its interaction with the dynamics under A and B. The system's final state will reflect the compound effects of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
