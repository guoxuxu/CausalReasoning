  "Problem": "In a complex analysis scenario, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\), integrating over the variable s. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time t, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the exact value of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) provides the net effect of the integral, but it does not uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as different frequencies could potentially produce the same effect through different paths in the complex plane. Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) makes it impossible to infer the frequency precisely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
