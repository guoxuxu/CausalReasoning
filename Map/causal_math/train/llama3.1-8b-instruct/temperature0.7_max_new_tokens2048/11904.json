  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real functions of time t governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), and A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-B)s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve naturally under the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax, \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T conform identically to the trajectory as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was evolved directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by integrating differences between the evolutions of x and y, weighted exponentially. This modifies both components in a way that their original dynamics under A and B alone wouldn't predict, leading to divergent trajectories for x and y, hence affecting z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
