  "Problem": "Consider a function h(z) defined over the complex plane, and let's apply a Fourier transform on this function, denoted as H(w), to analyze its behavior in frequency space.\n\nIf after obtaining H(w), we apply an inverse Fourier transform on H(w) modified by a Gaussian function exp(-aw^2), will the resulting function still resemble the original h(z) in terms of its core properties of polynomial degree?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the Gaussian modulation exp(-aw^2) in the frequency domain alters the original function's structure due to convolution effects, changing its nature when transformed back from frequency to spatial domain. This results in changes to the polynomial's nature and degree.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
