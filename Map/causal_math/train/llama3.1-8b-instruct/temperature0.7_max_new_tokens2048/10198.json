  "Problem": "Consider a linear electrical circuit analysis where the voltage, \\\\( V(t) \\\\), across a resistor and inductor in series is described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), with R as resistance, L as inductance, and I as the current. Let's analyze the scenario where an operation is performed to transform the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(I) = I^2 \\\\) just before starting the system.\n\nCan we determine whether the initial current was squared (\\\\( h(I) \\\\) was applied) or not simply by knowing the observed current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on whether the squaring function was applied, and with potentially different circuits or voltages leading to similar current patterns at t = T, it is impossible to infer unambiguously the exact nature of the starting current.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
