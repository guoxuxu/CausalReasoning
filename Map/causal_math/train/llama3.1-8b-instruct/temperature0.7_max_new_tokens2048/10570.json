  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) under a transformation \\\\( T(r, s) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-i\\\\theta} z(r\\\\cos(\\\\theta), s\\\\sin(\\\\theta)) d\\\\theta \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nAfter observing the output from \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original form of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the form of z?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation involves averaging over a parametric path which obscures unique features of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), especially since critical information about phase and amplitude variances at non-path points is lost. Therefore, the original form of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) cannot be exactly recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
