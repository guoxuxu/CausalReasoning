  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real constant and t is time. We will analyze scenarios pertaining to a Laplace transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time t = t1, we modify the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iBt} \\\\) where B is a different real constant, will the Laplace transform at s still reflect the initial value of A?",
  "Explanation": "The modification at t1 shifts the function to a new form, affecting the Laplace transform result for all t > t1. The final transform will reflect both the influence of A prior to t1 and B after t1, changing the overall dependency and hence not isolating A alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
