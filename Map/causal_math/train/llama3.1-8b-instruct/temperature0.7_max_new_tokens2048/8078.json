  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\), identifying how this transformed state evolves over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) evolved from \\\\(F(u_0)\\\\), can we accurately determine the initial state \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial condition underwent a Fourier transform, recovering the original \\\\(u_0\\\\) from \\\\(u(T)\\\\) requires the inversion of both the Fourier transform and the action of \\\\(L(u)\\\\). Without knowing about the application of \\\\(F\\\\), it is infeasible to accurately retrieve \\\\(u_0\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
