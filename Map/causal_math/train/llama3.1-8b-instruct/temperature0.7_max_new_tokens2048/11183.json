  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\). Let's introduce a complex transformation represented by \\\\( p(x) = e^{i \\\\theta}x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number. Analyze the behavior of a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) within this framework.\n\nIf an intervention by another linear transformation \\\\( N \\\\) is applied between the applications of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( p \\\\), will the outcome depend solely on the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) at any time?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new transformation \\\\( N \\\\) modifies the path of transformation, making the result dependent not only on \\\\( M \\\\) but also on \\\\( N \\\\). The resulting state is affected by all transformations involved (\\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and the complex function), and cannot be attributed to \\\\( M \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
