  "Problem": "Consider the operation of convolution on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) with a system impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) producing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\). We explore the causality implications of this convolution under a transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) where \\\\( F(t) \\\\) is another kernel function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by knowing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) obtained from the convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation by \\\\( F(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * F(t) \\\\) transforms the input in such a way that it cannot be reliably reversed without explicit knowledge of \\\\( F(t) \\\\). The presence of \\\\( F(t) \\\\) alters the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), producing a \\\\( y(t) \\\\) that is non-invertible back to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
