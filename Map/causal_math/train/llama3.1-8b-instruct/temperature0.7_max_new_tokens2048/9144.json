  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan we determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both were applied during the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) by only examining the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can arise from multiple possible transformation sequences or interactions between \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), especially since these transformations can modify the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) in non-reversible ways. The lack of unique mapping from end states to transformations means no definitive causal path can be determined from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
