  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the causal influences when we alter \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a multiplier \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly from observing the altered transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with the modification by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Considering the transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after applying \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), one cannot isolate the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific frequency shift \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Different values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) might result in the same transformed function under certain conditions, making the deduction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
