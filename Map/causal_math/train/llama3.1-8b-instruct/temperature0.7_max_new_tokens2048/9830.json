  "Problem": "Consider a system where the evolution of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The impact of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any observed state at time T could result from different initial states, given the potential modification by \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\). The lack of clarity on the presence of this transformation makes tracing back to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
