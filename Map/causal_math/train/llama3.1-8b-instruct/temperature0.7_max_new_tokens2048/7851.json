  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) in the complex plane where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), described by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dz} = Pu(z) \\\\), with P being a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qz}u(z) \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf, at some point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rz}u(z) \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(Z) \\\\) for \\\\( Z > z_1 \\\\) be influenced only by \\\\( P \\\\) and not \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) significantly influences the endpoint \\\\( u(Z) \\\\), making it dependent on \\\\( Q \\\\), \\\\( R \\\\), and \\\\( P \\\\). The transformations \\\\( e^{Qz} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rz} \\\\) can notably affect the trajectory of the function and the resulting state at \\\\( Z \\\\) due to their combined effects in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
