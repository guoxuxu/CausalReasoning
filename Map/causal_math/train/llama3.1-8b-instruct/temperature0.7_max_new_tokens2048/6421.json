  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is momentum, \\\\( m \\\\) is mass, and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is a potential energy function. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to the position function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to its Hamiltonian without further intervention, will the waveform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), which is the Fourier Transform of \\\\( x(T) \\\\), at any later time T be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was evolved directly to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without computation of the Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) does not alter the state of the system. Thus, the system will evolve based solely on its Hamiltonian, yielding the same position function at time T and, consequently, the same Fourier Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
