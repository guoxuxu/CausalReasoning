  "Problem": "Investigate a heat distribution system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\(k\\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial temperature distribution function, \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u) = u*\\\\sin(x)\\\\) is applied as an intervention at a specific time t > 0, will the resulting temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t depend solely on the original diffusion equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) and not on the Fourier or sine transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u)\\\\) modifies the temperature distribution by introducing new spatial variations via multiplication with \\\\(\\\\sin(x)\\\\). Therefore, the resulting temperature profile at time T > t is influenced not only by the original diffusion properties but also by the effects of both transformations, affecting how heat propagates from the modified conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
