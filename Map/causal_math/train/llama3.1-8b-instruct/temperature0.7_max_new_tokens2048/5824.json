  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{tA}x\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix with complex eigenvalues and \\\\(x\\\\) is an initial complex vector. We investigate the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Uz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine specifically whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(S(z)\\\\), both, or neither were applied, based only on the outcome at \\\\(T\\\\) and knowing \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\) does not uniquely determine the transformations applied. Due to the properties of unitary transformations and their effects on the system’s phase and basis while preserving norm, multiple combinations of transformations could lead to the same final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), especially without explicit information on interim states and precise times of application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
