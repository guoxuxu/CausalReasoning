  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = pz' + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants and \\\\( z' \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nKnowing the transformation result \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine which interventions were used (whether just \\\\( L \\\\), just \\\\( M \\\\), or both), considering only the end value of \\\\( Lz(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( Lz(T) \\\\) might be affected in numerous ways by the applications of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), and possibly their combined effects, especially given the inclusion of higher-order derivatives and linear transformations. The lack of exclusive trajectories for transformations involving derivatives means that different sequences or types of interventions could yield similar or identical results, obscuring the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
