  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system's state over time t. An integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) characterized by the kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\) is applied, influencing the evolution according to the formula \\\\(Tz(t) = \\\\int K(s, t) z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nSuppose a modification is introduced at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) in the form of a second transformation \\\\(U\\\\) with a different kernel \\\\(M(s, t)\\\\). Will the final state of the function at time \\\\(T\\\\) be influenced solely by the original kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\) without the impact of \\\\(M(s, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second transformation \\\\(U\\\\) modifies the trajectory of the function by applying a new kernel \\\\(M(s, t)\\\\) that interacts with and alters the evolution guided by the original kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\). The final state is therefore a result of both kernels' influences on the function, not merely the original one.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
