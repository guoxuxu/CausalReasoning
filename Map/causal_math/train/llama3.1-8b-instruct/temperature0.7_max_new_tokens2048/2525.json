  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), defined on a bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions. We focus on the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{pt}v(x) \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) solves the Laplace equation.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( u(0, x) = v(x) \\\\) is given, and the system evolves naturally over time without any external intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) depend solely on the initial transform \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\) of \\\\( v(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{pt}v(x) \\\\) represents a time-scaling of the spatial function \\\\( v(x) \\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at any time \\\\( T \\\\) is directly proportional to \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\). The temporal factor \\\\( e^{pT} \\\\) only scales the amplitude of the Fourier transform and does not affect its dependency on \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(k) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
