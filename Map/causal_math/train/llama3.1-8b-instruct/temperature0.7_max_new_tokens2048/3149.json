  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( Z(z) \\\\) is applied to the contour \\\\( C \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) and integrated, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\) yield the same result as integrating a simple linear function from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) can significantly alter the values along the contour \\\\( C \\\\) through the dynamics introduced by the complex exponentiation, leading to a different result than that of integrating a linear function which follows a simpler transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
