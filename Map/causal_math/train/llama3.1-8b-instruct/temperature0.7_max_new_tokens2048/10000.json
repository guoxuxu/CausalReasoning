  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or types of interventions. Given the non-commutative properties of complex exponential transformations and the overlap in potential outcomes, it's impossible to uniquely distinguish between different interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
