  "Problem": "Consider a complex system defined by the equation \\( z' = Cz \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex function and C is a constant complex matrix. The system transformation is analyzed through the lens of the integral transform \\( L(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{Mt}z(t)dt \\) across time interval [0, T], where M is a constant complex matrix and T is the endpoint of the considered interval.\n\nIf an intervention applying another transformation \\( H(z) = \\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{Nt}z(t)dt \\) (where N is another constant matrix and \\( t_1 \\) is intermediate) is introduced at \\( t_1 \\), will the resultant \\( L(z)(T) \\) be purely determined by C's influence over the entire interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\( H(z) \\) between \\( t_1 \\) and T brings another layer of exponential modulation through \\( e^{Nt} \\). The overall result \\( L(z)(T) \\) now reflects a combination of the actions of both C and N, along with the respective impacts of M and N over their operational intervals. This composition alters the final output, indicating dependency on multiple parameters, not just C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
