  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter. We study the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse in the system, given by the transformations \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(z) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 purely from its Laplace transform at any point without additional data or parameters about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From the Laplace transform alone and without knowing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original function since the transform does not retain all time-specific information and depends critically on the frequency parameter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
