  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the integral transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( e^{-2t} \\\\) and influences the system through the convolution \\\\( y(t) = (f * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the exact moments and nature of interventions applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) only by examining \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution process inherently integrates over past values, losing distinct information on timing and specifics of interventions. This loss of information, coupled with the mathematical complexity of deconvolving such transforms without residual intervention details, makes precise causal reconstruction based solely on the final output virtually impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
