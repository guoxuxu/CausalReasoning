  "Problem": "Consider a multivariable control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(x) = D \\\\exp(Mt)x \\\\), with D being another constant matrix, is applied to manipulate the system state over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The insertion of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by applying the matrix \\\\( D \\\\exp(Mt) \\\\) at t=0, which means the system's trajectory changes based on the properties of D relative to M. This changes the state at any later time t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
