  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We apply a time-dependent shift via an operator \\\\( H(t) \\\\) that transforms \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into \\\\( g(t) = t \\cdot f(t) \\\\) before the Laplace transform is taken, resulting in \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) = F'(s) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( H(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( G(s) = F'(s) \\\\), one could mistakenly identify \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) as representative of a different original function without recognizing the multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\) incorporated by \\\\( H(t) \\\\). Thus, the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely reconstructed without clear knowledge of the application of \\\\( H(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
