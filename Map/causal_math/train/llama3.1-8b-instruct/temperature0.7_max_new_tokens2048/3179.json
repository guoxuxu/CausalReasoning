  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system defined by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a matrix representing system dynamics. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\( L \\{x(t)\\} \\), and then modifying this transform with a filter defined by the function \\( H(s) \\), where s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), where the filter \\( H(s) \\) is adjusted or replaced by \\( J(s) \\), will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be independent of the initial filter \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the filter from \\( H(s) \\) to \\( J(s) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) does not negate the influence of \\( H(s) \\) on the system's state prior to \\( t_1 \\). The final state \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by both \\( H(s) \\) and \\( J(s) \\), reflecting the cumulative effect of both transformations on the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
