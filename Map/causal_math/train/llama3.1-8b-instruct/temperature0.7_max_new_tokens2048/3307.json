  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous dynamical system represented by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the system which transforms the original function \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\), followed by the application of an inverse transformation afterwards.\n\nIf an intervention involving an additional filtering operation represented by a multiplication with function \\\\(g(k)\\\\) in Fourier space is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reflect only changes due to the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention of filtering with \\\\(g(k)\\\\) modifies the Fourier components selectively, influencing how different modes evolve. This selective transformation changes the trajectory and final state in a way that depends on both the properties of L and the filter \\\\(g(k)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
