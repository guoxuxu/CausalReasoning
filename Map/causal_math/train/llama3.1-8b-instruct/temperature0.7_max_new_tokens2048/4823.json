  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nIf a time-shift operation defined by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-bt}f(t) \\\\) where b is a real number, is applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and then transformed, will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using a time-shift operation modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = e^{(a-b)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function, under the assumption that Re(s) > (a-b), results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\). The intervention clearly alters the transformed function in a predictable way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
