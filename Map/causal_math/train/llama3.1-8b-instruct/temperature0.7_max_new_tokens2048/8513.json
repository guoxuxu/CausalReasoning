  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\alpha z^2 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the implications of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\alpha z^2 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\alpha z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by a factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), which affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This transformation alters how the terms involving \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) interact with the state, leading to a different final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
