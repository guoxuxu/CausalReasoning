  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S(g)(x) = g(x) + x^2 \\\\) is applied at a point during the computation of \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the final state depend only on the transformation \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform reflects both the initial effect of \\\\( T \\\\) and the subsequent effect of \\\\( S \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the integrand structure significantly which, when further modified by \\\\( S \\\\), results in a final state whose spectral properties are influenced by both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
