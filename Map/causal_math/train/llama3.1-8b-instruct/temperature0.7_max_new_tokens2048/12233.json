  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an unknown time-domain function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its image in the complex frequency domain. The effect of a complex function \\\\( G(s) = s^2 + 1 \\\\) is to transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) into \\\\( G(s)F(s) \\\\) representing a modification in the frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by analyzing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{G(s)F(s)\\\\} \\\\) at time t, without knowing the transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), the altered transform \\\\( G(s)F(s) \\\\) will not clearly indicate the properties or form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The transformation potentially obscures the original function's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
