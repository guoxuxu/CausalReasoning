  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) with boundary conditions. We explore the system response under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) and consider the dynamics when impacted by an operation \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}\\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, T) \\\\), can we definitively determine if the intervention \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed state may exhibit characteristics indicative of an intervention, without additional context such as the phase shift caused by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or direct observation of the intervention event, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) \\\\) was applied simply based on the endpoint in the transform domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
