  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a vector space using a matrix M and its exponential \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) which acts on vectors in the space. We investigate the effects of initial transformations \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\), where N is another matrix, on the temporal evolution of vectors.\n\nGiven an initial application of \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\) on a vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, untouched thereafter, will the transformation under \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) for a time T result in the same vector as if only \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) had been applied directly to \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(x) = e^{Nt}x\\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial vector, and as it evolves under \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\), the trajectory depends on both N and M. The result depends on the interaction between N and M, generally leading to a different endpoint at time T than if \\\\(x_0\\\\) was only evolved under \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
