  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nGiven the final state of the vector \\\\(v(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (rotation, scaling, or both) were applied purely based on the final vector's characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The final vector \\\\(v(T)\\\\) can potentially be achieved through different sequences of rotations and scaling, dependent on the values of \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\), \\\\(s\\\\), and \\\\(t_1\\\\). The final vector does not uniquely specify the pathway of transformations applied due to the possible variations in these parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
