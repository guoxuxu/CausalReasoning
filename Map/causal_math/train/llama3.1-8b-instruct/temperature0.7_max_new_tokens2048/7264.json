  "Problem": "Assume there is a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex numbers. This function is applied iteratively in the context of complex dynamics, commonly used in generating Julia sets.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations were applied during the iteration by merely examining the sequence at some point after the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations could result in similar or even identical states in the sequence after their application, especially due to the non-linear nature of complex dynamics in \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Thus, identifying the specific interventions used is generally infeasible from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
