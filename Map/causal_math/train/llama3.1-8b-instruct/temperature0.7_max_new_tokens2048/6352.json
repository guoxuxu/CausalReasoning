  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state of a system is described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and u is a control input. Assume the control input is transformed according to \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\), where K and L are also constant matrices.\n\nCan we identify exactly which transformation from either \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both, was applied, only by observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of transformations applied to the control inputs over different intervals could lead to the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the overlapping effects and non-unique solutions in systems driven by linear combinations of controls and state transformations. Without additional data on timings and specifics of the interventions, the exact causal path cannot be isolated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
