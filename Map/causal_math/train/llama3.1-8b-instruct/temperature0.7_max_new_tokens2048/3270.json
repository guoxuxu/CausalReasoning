  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) = \\\\hat{u}(t, k)\\\\) and its inverse across variable transformations.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(T, k)\\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine the original function \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear and invertible operation, the original function \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) can be fully recovered from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(T, k)\\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform, regardless of the initial application of the Fourier transform, assuming no other transformations are applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
