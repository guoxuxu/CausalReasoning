  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with an inductor L and resistor R in series connected to an alternating voltage source given by \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The voltage across the inductor is described by the equation \\\\( V_L = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} \\\\) and the resistor by \\\\( V_R = RI \\\\). We study the effect of altering the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of the source on the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the circuit.\n\nGiven just the final impedance observed in the circuit, is it possible to determine precisely whether a capacitor was added or if the frequency was changed?",
  "Explanation": "The impedance in an LRC circuit, \\\\( Z = \\\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\\\omega L - 1/(\\\\omega C))^2} \\\\), is dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), L, C, and R. Each parameter can influence the impedance similarly. Hence, observing the impedance alone doesn’t allow us to differentiate between the effects of a frequency change or the addition of a capacitor.",
