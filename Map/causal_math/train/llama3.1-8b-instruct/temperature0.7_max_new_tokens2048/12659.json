  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) modified by a time delay \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we ascertain whether the alteration in the input was due to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or a different manipulation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear, multiple types of input alterations (like different time delays or alterations in input amplitude) could produce similar effects on the output, making it impossible to discern from the output alone whether it was specifically \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or another form of intervention that contributed to the observed change in \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
