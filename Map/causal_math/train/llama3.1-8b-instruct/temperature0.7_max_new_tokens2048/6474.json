  "Problem": "Consider a context where z is a complex function of a real variable x, written as z(x) = u(x) + iv(x) where u and v are real-valued functions of x. We study the effects and causes considering the integral transformation T defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function T(z)(x), can we exactly recover the original function z(x) without any prior knowledge of its form?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the integral transformation T to retrieve z(x) often is impossible without additional constraints or information about z. The transformation may be non-injective, meaning different functions z might give rise to the same transformed function T(z), particularly if z contains components that are eliminated or dampened by the exponential factor in T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
