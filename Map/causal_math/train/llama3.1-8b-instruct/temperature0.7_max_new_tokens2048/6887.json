  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). This changes the function domain and potentially the system dynamics.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( B \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function \\\\( e^{B(t-t_1)}z(t_1) \\\\), will the outcome of the Laplace transform, \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) at any s, be dependent only on the new matrix \\\\( B \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The system's state up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( A \\\\), and post-intervention dynamics depend on \\\\( B \\\\). The combined effect of both matrices will influence the final transformed system, not merely the latter interval's matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
