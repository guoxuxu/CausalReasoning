  "Problem": "Consider a scalar linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = kx\\\\), where k is a real constant. The Laplace transform of x(t) is used to obtain the transfer function, and various filters represented by transfer functions \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p}\\\\) are applied, where p is a pole introduced by the filter.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at t=T, can you conclusively determine if the system was subjected to a filtering process involving pole p, assuming no information about interventions is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of whether a filter was applied, deducing the presence of the filter solely from \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is unreliable. The exponential growth or decay in the output could also result from the natural dynamics driven by k, making it impossible to uniquely attribute the observed state to the application of a filter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
