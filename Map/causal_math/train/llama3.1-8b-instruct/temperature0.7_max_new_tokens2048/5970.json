  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we precisely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original complex signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function in the Fourier spectrum precisely identifies the frequency of the initial signal. The transform’s property to uniquely represent frequency components allows for exact inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
