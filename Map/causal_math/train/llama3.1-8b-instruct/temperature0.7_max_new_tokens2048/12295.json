  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nBased on the observation of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point on the complex plane, can we determine if the transformation step involved any specific values of C or D, or both?",
  "Explanation": "While you can infer the product of the constants C and D from the scaling of \\\\( u(z) \\\\) to \\\\( w(z) \\\\), distinguishing between the specific contributions of C and D individually to the final form of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is not possible without additional information, because their effects are multiplicatively intertwined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
