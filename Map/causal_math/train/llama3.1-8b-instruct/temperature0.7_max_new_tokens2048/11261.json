  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the Laplace Transform on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial t^2} = -\\\\alpha^2 h \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. The scenario investigates how transformations influence the solution and inference of initial conditions or operations on the function.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} \\\\) is taken for a solution \\\\( h(t) \\\\) of the given differential equation, and no further functional alteration is applied, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}\\\\} \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) yield the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse are designed such that if \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a well-behaved function that satisfies the given differential equation, and no modifications are made to its transform, then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}\\\\} \\\\) will indeed recover the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This equivalence holds assuming all conditions for the proper application of the Laplace Transform are met, such as linearity and exponential boundedness.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
