  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a system's state over time. The Laplace Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the effect of applying an input function \\\\( u(t) = e^{st} \\\\) to this system, particularly considering how intervention could impact temporal dynamics.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time t = T, can we determine the original state of the system at t = 0 without knowing whether the input \\\\( u(t) = e^{st} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) could have influenced \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in a way that is indistinguishable from the system's natural behaviour. Without this knowledge, it's impossible to uniquely back-calculate to the initial state, given that the Laplace Transform may represent multiple underlying functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
