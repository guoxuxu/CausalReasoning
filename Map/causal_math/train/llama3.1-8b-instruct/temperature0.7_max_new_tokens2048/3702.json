  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, and an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to it. Analyze how identifying causal relations in such a context might be impacted by the properties of the function and transformation.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( T[h](s) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) in the absence of information on the functional form of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) generally loses information about the original function due to its nature (integral transformation often smooths or aggregates the function characteristics). Without knowledge of \\\\( h \\\\)'s dependency on \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), it is typically not possible to deduce their exact values uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
