  "Problem": "Consider the effects of applying a complex transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iw}z \\\\) on a vector field governed by a Laplace equation \\(-\\Delta u = 0\\). We are examining the system's response over time and the causal inference of operations.\n\nAssume that at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a phase adjustment intervention \\\\( v \\mapsto v e^{i\\theta} \\\\) is applied. Will the resulting field at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), solely be determined by the initial and final transformations and not by their intervening adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds an additional effect on the system, altering its phase and potentially interfering with how the field evolves according to the Laplace equation. The final field state at time T is influenced by all transformations, initial, intermediate, and possibly final.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
