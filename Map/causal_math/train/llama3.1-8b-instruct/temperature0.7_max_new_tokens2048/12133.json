  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is known to reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\). We explore the impact of modifying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by a function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the time-domain representation of the function.\n\nCan we confirm definitively that the modification by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) was responsible for any observed shift in \\\\( h(t) \\\\) based solely on the shifted function \\\\( h(t-a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the precise transformation in the Laplace domain based solely on observing a shift in \\\\( h(t) \\\\) isn't feasible without additional information, such as the value of \\\\( a \\\\) or confirmation that \\\\( G(s) \\\\) was applied. There could potentially be other operational transformations that result in similar shifts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
