  "Problem": "Consider the problem of heat distribution over a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion constant and u(x, t) represents the temperature. An integral transformation using the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the solution's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then evolved according to the transformed diffusion equation, will the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( F(u)(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at time T exactly represent the temperature distribution u(x, T)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform and its inverse forms an integral part of solving the diffusion equation. The transformed equation governs the evolution, and its solution accurately transforms back to provide the correct temperature distribution at any time T due to the linearity and properties of the Fourier transform.",
