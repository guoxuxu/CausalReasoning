  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention changes the function form to \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(t) = z(t) + \\\\alpha e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants) at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the new transformed function \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention distinctly changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by adding a component \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), which significantly influences the response under the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Therefore, the output \\\\( T(\\\\tilde{z}(T)) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), as well as \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
