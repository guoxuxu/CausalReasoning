  "Problem": "In a statistical framework, consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = X\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon \\\\), where \\\\( X \\\\) represents predictor variables matrix, \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) a coefficients vector, and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the error terms. We are examining the effect of a simultaneous linear transformation applied to both \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) through matrix \\\\( T \\\\) which affects the causality from predictors to response.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to both \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), such that we now have \\\\( X' = TX \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta' = T^{-1}\\\\beta \\\\), and no other interventions are applied, will the effect on \\\\( z \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( X \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( T^{-1} \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) balances the transformations, leaving the product \\\\( X\\\\beta \\\\) mathematically equivalent to \\\\( X'\\\\beta' \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z \\\\) stays invariant under this transformation irrespective of matrix \\\\( T \\\\)'s specific properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
