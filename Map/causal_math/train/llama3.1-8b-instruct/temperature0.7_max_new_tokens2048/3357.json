  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze scenarios where g(t) is a solution to a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with initial conditions, and \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, we study the implications of adding transformations like \\\\( g(t) = h(t)g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is known.\n\nIf the initial condition of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is modified by a scalar factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without further intervention, does the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) also change by the same scalar factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\alpha g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\alpha G(s) \\\\), multiplying the initial condition by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) proportionally changes the Laplace transform. The linearity of both the differential equation and the Laplace transformation ensures the transform of the resulting function is simply scaled by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
