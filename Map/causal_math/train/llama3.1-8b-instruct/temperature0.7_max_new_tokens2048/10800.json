  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Here, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is described by the time-domain differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal or control function. The Fourier transform is taken with respect to the function after applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(T) \\\\} \\\\) at the end of the interval, can we deduce which interventions (\\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, relying solely on the Fourier transform data?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform might display certain dominant frequencies or characteristics that suggest manipulation, yet it does not provide clear traceable evidence back to specific transformations like \\\\( Dx \\\\) or \\\\( Ex \\\\). Different combinations of transformations and input functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) might result in similar frequency content, making it challenging to distinguish which transformations were precisely used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
