  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex numbers, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are complex constants. The function’s evolution over time is analyzed considering linear transformations and their implications on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial values \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without additional information on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without knowing the values of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The transformations depending on these constants can radically alter the initial conditions in a non-invertible way if the constants are unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → e^(At); B → e^(Bt); x → z(t); y → z(t); e^(At) → z(t); e^(Bt) → z(T); z(T) → x; z(T) → y"
