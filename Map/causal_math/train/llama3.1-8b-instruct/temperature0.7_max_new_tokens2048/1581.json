  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The system is subject to the operation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) operates on it, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[f(z)](s) \\\\) at \\\\( s \\\\) be the same as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is not squared?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring operation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) substantially modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), enhancing non-linear characteristics and potentially affecting the area under the curve differently. Therefore, the resulting transformed function will not simply be the transformed original; their Laplace transforms will differ due to the alteration in functional form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
