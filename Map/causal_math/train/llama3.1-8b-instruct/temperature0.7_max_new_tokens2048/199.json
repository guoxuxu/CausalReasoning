  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanics problem where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). We examine the situation where an operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) acts on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) before evolution.\n\nIf another operator \\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), do the properties of the operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) still have an effect on the state at time \\\\(T\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both operators \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\) will affect the wave function's evolution. The impact of \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) on the initial state, compounded with the influence of \\\\(\\\\hat{P}\\\\), determines the overall state at time \\\\(T\\\\). The result is a combined effect of both operators through their respective transformations on the wave function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
