  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between two variables in a complex system where the effect of one component \\(\\ z \\) is defined by the integral transform \\(\\ Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), using the Laplace transform. We explore the scenario where \\(\\ z(t) \\) is a function influenced by another variable \\(\\ x(t) \\) such that \\(\\ z(t) = t \\cdot x(t) \\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\(\\ Z(s) \\) at time \\( T \\), can we accurately trace back whether any intervention occurred (like changing \\(\\ x(t) \\) at some \\( t_1 \\))?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations or interventions on \\(\\ x(t) \\) can produce the same resulting \\(\\ Z(s) \\), particularly since the relationship between \\(\\ z(t) \\) and \\(\\ x(t) \\) and across their transforms is non-explicit and depends also on integration properties. Thus, specifics of interventions cannot be uniquely reversed-engineered from \\(\\ Z(s) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
