  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. Here A and B are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the integral transform \\\\(F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\(F[z](s)\\\\) is applied to the functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the systems are allowed to evolve under their respective equations without further intervention, will \\\\(F[z](s)\\\\) at some s be the same as if the systems were directly evolved and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and time invariance of integral transforms and linear differential equations mean that applying the transform at the initial state (t=0) or after evolution yields the same result due to the properties of convolution in the Laplace transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
