  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), which transforms a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into its Laplace Transform domain representative \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Suppose an original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A is a scalar, and its behavior under perturbation represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Bt}f(t) \\\\), where B is also a scalar.\n\nIf a constant intervention modeled as \\\\( h(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) (where C is a scalar) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the outcome function depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and ignore the effects of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) impacts the system by introducing a new growth rate, forming \\\\( e^{(A-B+C)t} \\\\) after the intervention. Consequently, the result is a composite of the effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\), leading to a final Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) which depends on all three.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
