  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = K(t)x \\\\) over time t, where K(t) is a time-dependent matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( m(x) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, just by knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations or sequences of transformations due to the interplay of the matrix functions. Non-commutative effects and overlapping changes in state trajectories prevent the clear delineation of specific interventions based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
