  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nIf, during the integration process, the function undergoes an additional transformation \\( S(z) = z^2 \\), will the final result \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(S(z(x))) \\, dx \\) depend solely on \\( T \\) and not on \\( S \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) contribute to the final state of the integral. \\( S \\), applying a square function, can create new or remove existing singularities, while \\( T \\), being a reciprocal function, will further modify these conditions. This leads to a cumulative effect that is dependent on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
