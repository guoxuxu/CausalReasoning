  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem associated with the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space. The operator is defined by the differential equation \\\\(L[u] = -y'' + q(x)y \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(y(0) = y(1) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is a potential function.\n\nGiven the observed eigenvalues \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), can we uniquely determine if a change in the potential function from \\\\(q(x)\\\\) to \\\\(q'(x)\\\\) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential functions can potentially lead to the same set of eigenvalues due to the non-uniqueness and possible isospectral potentials. Without additional information, the original potential function cannot be precisely deduced from eigenvalues alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
