  "Problem": "Consider a model for the propagation of a signal \\\\(s(t)\\\\) through a medium, where the signal is initially transformed by a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\), and the medium's response is modeled by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. The propagation is analyzed at various times t under different transformations.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(y) \\\\), or both), based solely on the observed final state?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can result from different sequences of transformations and dynamical processing, and the linear nature of the differential equation means that multiple combinations of K and M might yield the same final state. This ambiguity prevents unique identification of the specific transformations applied from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
