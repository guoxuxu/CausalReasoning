  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values are altered to \\( x'=ax \\) and \\( y'=by \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants, and then \\( z \\) is calculated without further modification, does this change the outcome of \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied after modifying \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the new \\( z' \\) will be \\( (ax)^2 + 3(ax)(by) + (by)^2 \\). The exponential nature of \\( g(z) \\) means small changes in \\( z \\) due to changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can lead to significantly different outcomes in \\( g(z) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
