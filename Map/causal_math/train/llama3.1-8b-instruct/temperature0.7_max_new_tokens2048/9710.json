  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowledge about whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, is it possible to deduce accurately the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without definite knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), especially not knowing the specifics of the matrix C, the transformation could have altered the initial state in multiple ways, hence making it impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
