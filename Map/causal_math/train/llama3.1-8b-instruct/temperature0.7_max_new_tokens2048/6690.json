  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), with constants a and b. We assess the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) under different transformations and alterations to the original Laplace transform equation.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we uniquely determine the original constants a and b in the expression for \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) provides limited information at a specific instance and multiple pairs of constants (a, b) might result in the same value at that particular time. Without additional data points or constraints, determining a and b uniquely from a single value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
