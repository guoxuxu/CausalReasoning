  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\), where M is a constant 2x2 matrix. Explore the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the system, where the Laplace transform of a vector function is applied component-wise.\n\nGiven a final observed state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine which specific transformations (including linear or non-linear) were applied during the interval from 0 to T, based solely on the known endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied during the evolution involves having to distill multiple possibilities that could result in the same \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\). Without additional constraints or information about the transformations (whether they were linear transformations like \\\\(M\\\\) or involved non-linearities like \\\\(g\\\\)), it is not possible to uniquely identify the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
