  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra framework analyzing the effect of matrix diagonalization on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system examines the matrix transformation \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\), where A is an initial matrix and P is the matrix formed by the eigenvectors of A.\n\nIf after transforming A to D an external matrix Q modifies D to form \\\\( Q^{-1}DQ \\\\), will the resultant matrix have the same eigenvalues as the initial matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "Matrix transformations such as Q that simply change the basis (assuming Q is invertible and modifies the basis correctly) do not affect the eigenvalues. Therefore, despite the intervention, the eigenvalues of the resultant matrix will remain unchanged from those of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → P; A → D; P → D; D → Q^{-1}; Q^{-1} → Q; Q → Q^{-1}DQ; Q^{-1}DQ → eigenvalues; A → eigenvalues; D → eigenvalues; Q → eigenvalues; Q^{-1} → eigenvalues"
