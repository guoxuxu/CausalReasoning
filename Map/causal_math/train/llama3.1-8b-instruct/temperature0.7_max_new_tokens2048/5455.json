  "Problem": "In the context of a quantum mechanics framework, the time evolution of a quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, where the Hamiltonian operator \\\\( H \\\\) may involve time-dependent terms. We study the effect of applying an initial quantum gate transformation, represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U \\\\), on the state \\\\( \\\\psi(0) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by another unitary operation \\\\( V(t) \\\\), time-dependent, is applied at a selected time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) depend solely on the properties of the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) and not on the initial operation \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) is influenced by all transformations along its evolution, including both the initial operation \\\\( U \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( V(t) \\\\). These transformations interact with the evolving Hamiltonian, making the final state a result of a complex interaction between \\\\( U \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), and \\\\( H \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
