  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. This function describes a circle in the complex plane over time. We investigate the impacts of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(z) = zd^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined solely by the original function's parameters and not influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifications to the path, influencing both the magnitude and phase of the trajectory. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), as well as the original angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), affecting the final magnitude and position in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
