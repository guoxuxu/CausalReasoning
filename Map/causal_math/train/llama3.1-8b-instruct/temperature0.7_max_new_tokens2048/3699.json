  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This scenario investigates how the causal relationship between functions and their transforms behaves with or without interventions in the form of function modification.\n\nIf an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) during the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), will \\\\( H(s) \\\\) only reflect the presence of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and not the addition of the constant \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will be \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}(f(t) + c)\\\\}(s) = F(s-a) + \\\\frac{c}{s-a} \\\\). This shows dependence on both the exponential modification and the initial constant addition, indicating combined effects, not isolating one.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
