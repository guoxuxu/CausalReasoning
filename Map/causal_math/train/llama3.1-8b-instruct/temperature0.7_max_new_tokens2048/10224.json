  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform properties of matrices \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), along with the evolution matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), mean the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various paths and interventions. Different sequences of applying these transformations could yield the same final state due to the overlapping effects and non-unique decompositions of state transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
