  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\) is explicitly connected to the system's own dynamics since \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\). Therefore, any vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and then evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) follows a trajectory that differs only transiently from its direct evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), but converges to the same state at any given time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
