  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the complex initial condition. We evaluate how the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant, affects the evolution over time.\n\nCan the exact interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) used be determined conclusively based only on the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential overlap of effects from the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\), multiple combinations of interventions can lead to the same observed state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, one cannot uniquely identify the interventions used solely from the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
