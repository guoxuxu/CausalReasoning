  "Problem": "In a control theory context, consider the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) where C and D are constant matrices, and u is a control input. We explore the effect of the Laplace transform on the system's response, particularly through an impulse response represented by matrix H, where H is defined as the transformation \\\\(H(s) = C^{-1}D\\\\).\n\nIf the control input u is an impulse at t = 0, and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) without further intervention, will the application of the Laplace transform on the evolving system directly yield H(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the impulse response of the system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\\\) directly results in \\\\(H(s)\\\\) due to the properties of Laplace transformations in linear time-invariant systems. The transform of the system's response to an impulse at t = 0 is equivalent to the matrix H(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
