  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf an intervention squaring the function is applied at a certain time t1, will the trajectory from t1 to T be independent of the initial angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After the intervention at t1, the new function becomes \\\\( (e^{i\\omega t_1})^2 e^{i\\omega (t-t_1)} \\\\), which depends on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The angular frequency and trajectory up to t1 play a crucial role in determining the trajectory from t1 to T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
