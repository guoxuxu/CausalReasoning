  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nIf the parameter 'b' in the circuit equation is modified at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the long-term behavior of the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solely depend on the original settings of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) without considering the change in 'b'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'b' recalibrates the relationship between the input and output, directly influencing the circuit's response. The long-term behavior of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will depend on both the original settings and the new value of 'b', reflecting the impact of this parameter on the system's transfer function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
