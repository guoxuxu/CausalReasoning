  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) a constant vector. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) was applied, deducing the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) exclusively from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is uncertain. The transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have changed the initial vector field, and without knowledge of B, the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) remains indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
