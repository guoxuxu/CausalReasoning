  "Problem": "Let's explore a scenario involving a Laplace transform used to solve an initial value problem described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 \\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the behavior of the solution subject to modifications by the transform \\( T(y) = y e^{kt} \\), where k is a constant.\n\nAfter observing \\( y(t) \\) at time T, which has evolved from \\( T(y_0) \\), is it possible to uniquely determine the initial value \\( y_0 \\) without knowing k?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\( y(t) \\) but not the value of k used in the exponential term \\( e^{kt} \\) prevents the accurate determination of \\( y_0 \\). The transformation could have variously scaled \\( y_0 \\), and without precise knowledge of this scaling factor, multiple potential initial values could have led to the same observed \\( y(t) \\).",
