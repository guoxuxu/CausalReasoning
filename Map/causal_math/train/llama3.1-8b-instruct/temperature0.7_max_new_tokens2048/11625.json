  "Problem": "Assess the study of causal inference in a system modeled by a linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\(T_k(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) is applied, where k represents a frequency parameter.\n\nIf the system is initially given a profile \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed profile \\\\(T_k(u(t))\\\\) at any time t reflect the exact dynamics dictated solely by L?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) as it evolves under the operator L will be accurately captured by \\\\(T_k(u(t))\\\\) for any t, reflecting the intrinsic dynamics governed by L. The integral transform \\\\(T_k\\\\) is linear and commutes with \\\\(L\\\\), preserving the system's behavior in the transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
