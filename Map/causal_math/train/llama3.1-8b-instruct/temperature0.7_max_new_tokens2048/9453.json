  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions by multiplying \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) at t=0, effectively altering the phase of the initial vector. This modification affects the trajectory under the original system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T due to phase shifts induced by B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
