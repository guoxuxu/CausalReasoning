  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined in the complex plane, which represents a rotation as a function of time. Analyze how the Laplace Transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) of this function, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}e^{it} \\\\, dt \\), affects the original function's behavior under various conditions.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes the transformation of Laplace Transform without any additional manipulation, will the transformation inherently alter the function's frequency property?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) changes the domain from time to a complex frequency domain, inherently altering its characteristic as a function of frequency, including the interpretation and behavior of the signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
