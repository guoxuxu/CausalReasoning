  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations of interventions with \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) or even none, depending on their values and how they influence the trajectory through time. The overlapping effects and non-linear nature of exponentiation in complex dynamics prohibit a clear reconstruction of interventions merely from the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
