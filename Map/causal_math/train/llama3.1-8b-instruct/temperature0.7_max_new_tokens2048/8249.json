  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. The scenario investigates how the function's behavior changes under various transformations, particularly a transformation applied by an integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(Tf(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a fixed real constant.\n\nIf the integral operator \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any further manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t\\\\) solely depend on the initial function and not on the integral transformation parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) will be influenced by both the nature of the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the parameters of the transformation (\\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) in this case). The integral operator significantly alters the output depending on its own structure, affecting the result at any given time \\\\(t\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
