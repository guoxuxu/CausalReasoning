  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system defined by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a matrix representing the system dynamics and B is the input matrix controlling the system through input u. We test the effect of a specific integral transformation, defined by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^Te^{Dt}Budt \\\\), on the system's behavior over an interval [0, T].\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to calculate a new state at t=0 and the system is then evolved to time T under the original dynamics without any additional inputs, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be equivalent to evolving the system from an initial state x(0) with input u applied continuously?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) integrates over an applied input, significantly affecting system state by the calculated integral value, unlike a natural evolution where continuous input dynamically influences system behavior through B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
