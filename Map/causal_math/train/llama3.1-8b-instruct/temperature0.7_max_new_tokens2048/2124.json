  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the transformation defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying precise interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to potential overlapping effects of matrix exponentials from both initial and intervening transformations. Multiple intervention combinations might produce the same or similar endpoints, further complicating the analysis.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
