  "Problem": "A complex line integral is evaluated along different paths in a complex domain. The function is \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and the integral paths are circles centered at 0 with varying radii. We explore the impact of modifications to the path (change in the radius).\n\nIf the radius of the path initially set at 1 is modified to radius 2 at mid-calculation, and this change is considered as an intervention, will the resulting integral still be \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the radius during the integral calculation does not affect the end result so long as the path continues to enclose the pole z = 0 and no additional poles are crossed. The integral of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) along any such path remains \\\\(2\\\\pi i\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A modification to the radius of the path directly causes a change to the path, which in turn directly causes a change to the integral."
