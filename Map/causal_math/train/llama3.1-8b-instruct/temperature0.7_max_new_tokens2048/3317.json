  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the action of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at initial time t = 0 to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further modifications, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from that obtained if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to time T without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially modifies the magnitude of the complex number, which influences the trajectory of the solution. The original system evolves the phase only (spiral on a complex plane), but application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) also affects the magnitude, leading to a different state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
