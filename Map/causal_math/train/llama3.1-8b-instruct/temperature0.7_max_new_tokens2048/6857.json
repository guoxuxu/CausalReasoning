  "Problem": "Consider a function space transformation governed by integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a function in time domain and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. Analyze the effect of applying the inverse Laplace transformation on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and compare it under different variations of function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\) is Laplace transformed to \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then its inverse transform is applied without any modification, will the resulting function still be \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By the properties of the Laplace transform and its inverse, applying these operations consecutively without modification to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will recover the original function, thus \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\) remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
