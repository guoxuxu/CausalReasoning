  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact of the Laplace Transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) that represents a time-domain signal, specifically focusing on how applying the inverse Laplace Transform affects inference regarding the original function.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) is computed for a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and no further operations are applied, will the resultant function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) carry all information about \\\\( f(t) \\\\) unaltered?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a linear integral transform which is bijective for functions that meet its convergence criteria. Hence, all information about \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is carried over to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without loss, provided the function is within the transform's class of definable functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
