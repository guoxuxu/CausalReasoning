  "Problem": "Analyze the role of the Laplace transform in a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t + Au = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a linear operator. We consider the application of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and explore the repercussions on the system's response over time.\n\nGiven the final form of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) can we determine exactly whether it was the result of the initial operator \\\\( A \\\\) or due to the intervention of \\\\( B \\\\) without additional historical knowledge of the system's dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which operator influenced the final form of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) solely from the outcome is unfeasible because similar effects could result from different causes or combinations of operators in linear systems, leading to an inability to distinguish merely based on the final Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
