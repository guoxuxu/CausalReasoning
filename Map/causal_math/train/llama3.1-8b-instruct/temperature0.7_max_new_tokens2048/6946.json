  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at T, can we accurately trace back to the original signal \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was continuously applied or just initially?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\), whether initially or continuously applied, affects the evolution of the original signal in such a way that without explicit knowledge of its application regime (continuous or initial), determining \\\\( x_0 \\\\) just from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the complex interaction between the transformation and the linear operator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
