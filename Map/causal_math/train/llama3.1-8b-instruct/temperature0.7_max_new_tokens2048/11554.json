  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( M \\\\), the changes induced by the matrix in the real and imaginary components aren't evident from the final Fourier transform alone. This lack of information prevents the exact back-calculation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
