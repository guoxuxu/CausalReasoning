  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), a complex exponential where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real parameter representing frequency. We inspect the behavior of this function under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) over domain \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( Mz(x) \\\\) (where \\\\( M \\\\) is another complex constant) at some \\\\( x = X \\\\), will \\\\( T(z(X)) \\\\) purely depend on \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), disregarding \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new endpoint \\\\( z(X) \\\\) after intervention by \\\\( M \\\\) still undergoes the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), making the outcome dependent on all parameters \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involving \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) remains influential in determining the end state alongside the intervention effect from \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
