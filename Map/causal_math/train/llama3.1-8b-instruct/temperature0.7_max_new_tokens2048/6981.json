  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. This system undergoes an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x t} f(t) dt \\\\), and we explore the influence of this transformation on the system's behavior.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0, then letting it evolve under the original system dynamics without any further transformation, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be affected by the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into its Fourier transform, changing the state in a way that is not equivalent to the simple evolution under \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} x_0 \\\\). This new state evolves differently due to the alteration in its frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
