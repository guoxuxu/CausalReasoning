  "Problem": "We study a vector field \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by two processes: multiplication by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iwt}z \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) applied over time. We aim to understand how these transformations impact \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state after applying \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether the interventions \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both, were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences of applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\), along with different initial conditions, can produce the same final transformed state due to the Fourier transform's properties and the complex function interactions that affect phase but not magnitude in a non-trivial manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
