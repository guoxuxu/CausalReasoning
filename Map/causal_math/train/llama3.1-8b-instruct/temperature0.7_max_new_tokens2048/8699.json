  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic study involving a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant, applied to a complex variable z. We define a transformation using the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) on this function and analyze various cases of causal inference.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an adjustment or intervention is applied directly modifying \\\\( z \\\\) such that the new value becomes \\\\( z' = z + B \\\\) with B as another complex constant; will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( f(z') = e^{A(z + B)} = e^{AB}e^{Az} \\\\), thus altering not only the scale but potentially the growth rate and phase due to e^{AB}. Consequently, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) now depends on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
