  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\) describing the trajectory of a particle in the complex plane, where \\\\( R(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the radial and angular components, respectively. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time t = t_1, an intervention with a new function \\\\( h(z) = z e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and only reflect the effects of \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at t_1 modifies the trajectory again, superimposing an additional phase shift of \\\\( \\\\beta t \\\\) onto whatever effect \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) had accumulated up to t_1. Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the original transformation and the intervention, depending on the interplay of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
