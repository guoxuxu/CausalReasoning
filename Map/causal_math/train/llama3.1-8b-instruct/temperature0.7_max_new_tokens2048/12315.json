  "Problem": "Consider the impact of varying the counterpart of a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant real number, on the integral transform \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\\\). We investigate how changes in \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) affect the outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nFrom the characteristics of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) observed at time \\\\\\( T \\\\\\), can we ascertain whether a specific phase shift \\\\\\( \\\\phi \\\\\\) was applied at any time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\) without knowing \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\)'s pre-modification state?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the presence and specifics of phase shift interventions like \\\\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\\\) purely from the observed \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) characteristics is challenging without initial knowledge of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\)'s state. Phase shifts can alter the magnitude or alignment of spectral components ambiguously, making it difficult to trace back to exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
