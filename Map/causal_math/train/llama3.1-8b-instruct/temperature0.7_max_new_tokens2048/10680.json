  "Problem": "Consider the diffusion equation for heat transfer in a rod, \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), where u is the temperature, x is the spatial variable, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effect of an initial function \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is also a constant.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some time t after an unknown intervention changing thermal diffusivity, can we determine whether the original parameter was a or another value?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusive nature of the heat equation and the possibility of an unknown change in thermal diffusivity introduce significant uncertainty in deducing the exact initial parameter a. The alteration not only affects the diffusion speed but also the manner in which the initial conditions are propagated, obscuring the initial setup.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
