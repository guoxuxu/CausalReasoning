  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. The Laplace transform of the function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} + i\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the function in the s-domain. We further apply an integral transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied, one cannot uniquely deduce \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) due to the potential alterations made by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Multiple different initial functions could yield the same \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) under different transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
