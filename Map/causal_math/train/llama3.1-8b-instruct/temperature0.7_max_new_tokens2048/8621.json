  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nDoes performing a Laplace Transform on a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and using the result \\\\( X(s) \\\\) to perform an inverse calculation at a later time \\\\( s = T \\\\) yield the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for all t without any loss due to the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and its inverse are theoretically precise for sufficiently well-behaved functions (like those that are continuous and of exponential order). Therefore, the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) can be perfectly recovered at all times from its Laplace Transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) without any information loss.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
