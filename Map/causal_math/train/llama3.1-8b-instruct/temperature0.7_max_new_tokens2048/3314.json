  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is an analytic solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Evaluate how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) influences the system's behavior.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) was ever computed, can you retrospectively determine the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t < T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of the Fourier transform does not affect the system's state and serves only as an analysis tool. Thus, knowing whether it was computed provides no additional information about the system's state evolution prior to time \\\\( T \\\\), which is dictated solely by the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
