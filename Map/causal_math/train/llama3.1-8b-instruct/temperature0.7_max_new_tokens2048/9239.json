  "Problem": "Investigate a system subjected to the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse, influencing a time-dependent function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially impacted by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) and analyzed for causality and effects of transformations.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation by a factor function \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant, is applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), will the final Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) \\\\) be unaffected by the initial square transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) introduces further modifications to the Laplace domain characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), making the resultant transform dependent not only on the original function but also on both the square and exponential transformations. This leads to a compounded alteration in the s-domain representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
