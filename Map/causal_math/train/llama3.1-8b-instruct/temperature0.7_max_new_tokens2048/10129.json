  "Problem": "Consider a differential operator \\\\( L[y] = \\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} - y \\\\) operating in a complex function space. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) on functions that are solutions to the differential equation \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at x = 0, solves \\\\( L[y] = 0 \\\\) and then undergoes the transformation \\\\( T[y] \\\\), will \\\\( T[y](s) \\\\) be a solution to the transformed differential equation derived from \\\\( L \\\\) under the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[y] \\\\) converts the second-order differential equation into a characteristic equation component in the Laplace transform, satisfying the associated transformed differential equation. The effect of the transformation aligns correctly with how differential operators behave under integral transforms such as the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
