  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is also a constant matrix. The transformation occurs over time t concerning an initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where E is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) as an intervention alters the trajectory further depending on the relation between matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\), and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be dependent on the interplay of these matrix exponentials and cannot rely solely on C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
