  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(\\\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)(\\\\xi) \\\\) and then evolved according to the wave equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be identical to the wave evolution from the untransformed \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the modal composition of the wave, influencing how each mode evolves over time. The transformation to the frequency domain and subsequent evolution can alter the phase and amplitude of each component differently compared to the spatial domain evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
