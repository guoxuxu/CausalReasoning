  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a system of linear differential equations. Let \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be the voltage at a given node, represented by the linear relationship \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = MV + NU \\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(U(t)\\\\) represents external inputs like currents. Analyze the effects of applying an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, to the inputs.\n\nIs it possible to determine exactly which transformations (Laplace or Fourier) were applied to \\\\( U(t) \\\\) based solely on the resultant voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at a large t?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant \\\\( V(t) \\\\) could potentially be the same for different transformations of the input due to the properties of linear systems and their responses to similar but differently transformed inputs. Without additional data about the transformations, it is not possible to uniquely identify the specific transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
