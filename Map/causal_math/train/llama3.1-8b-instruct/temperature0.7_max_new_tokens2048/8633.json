  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier transform scenario where a given function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on the domain \\\\( t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) undergoes the transformation defined by \\\\( F(\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(f(t))(\\\\xi) \\\\), which is the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The variable \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\) denotes frequency. The effect of a multiplicative modulation by a cosine wave, \\\\( h(t) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\), on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is considered, i.e., the new function becomes \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is subjected to a Fourier transform without any intervention, will \\\\( G(\\\\xi) \\\\) (the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)) be equivalent to \\\\( F(\\\\xi) \\\\) (the transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\) results in the convolution of \\\\( F(\\\\xi) \\\\) with a function involving Dirac delta functions at \\\\( \\\\pm \\\\omega_0 \\\\). This shifts and splits the energy content of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) around these frequencies, producing a different result compared to the direct transform \\\\( F(\\\\xi) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
