  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the input function is \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the output function is \\\\(y(t)\\\\) given by \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\) where L represents the Laplace transform operation. We analyze transformations by applying an exponential modifier \\\\(f(x) = e^{-\\sigma t}x(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) at some point, can we deduce the original function \\\\(x_0(t)\\\\) after observing the output without knowing whether \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(x)\\\\), the transformation due to \\\\(e^{-\\sigma t}\\\\) could have shifted the frequency domain characteristics in a way that is non-retraceable without additional information, as it directly affects the poles and zeros in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
