  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where 'a' is a constant complex number. We explore the scenario under the Fourier transform, defined by the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an initial function form \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation, does this change the complexity or distribution property of the system in the frequency domain compared to a direct calculation of the transform from \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) yields a simple computation that reflects the intrinsic properties of the function in the frequency domain. This direct transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{a + i\\\\omega} \\\\), depending on 'a', already accounts for all characteristics of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
