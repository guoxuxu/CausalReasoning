  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect on complex numbers in the context of the complex plane transformation. We investigate how this transformation influences the properties of integration along a closed contour C, before and after specific interventions.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex contour \\\\( C_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the contour is allowed to evolve under normal complex rotations without further intervention, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equal to the integral along \\\\( C_0 \\\\) if no transformation was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) alters the nature of the contour in the complex plane, which in turn affects the result of the integral. This transformation may map the contour inside-out, substantially affecting the value of the contour integral compared to its original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
