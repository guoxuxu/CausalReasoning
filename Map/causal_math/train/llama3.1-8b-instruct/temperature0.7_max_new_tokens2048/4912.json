  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nBased on the state observed at time \\\\( T \\\\) in a system where both \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) and an unknown transformation \\\\( g \\\\) could have been applied, can we precisely determine what transformation \\\\( g \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint state could potentially result from a variety of transformations due to the properties of powers in exponential functions, which might produce similar outcomes for different values of \\\\( m \\\\) in transformations like \\\\( g(z) = z^m \\\\). Thus, it's not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( g \\\\) based solely on the state at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
