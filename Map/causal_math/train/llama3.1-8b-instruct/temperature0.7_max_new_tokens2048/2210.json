  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation in a complex plane defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Analyze the evolution of values under the transformation and its implications with and without external interventions.\n\nAfter observing the transformed value \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) at some point, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z \\\\) successfully?",
  "Explanation": "Given the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane, multiple values of \\\\( z \\\\) can result in the same outcome due to the \\\\( 2\\\\pi i \\\\) periodicity. Without additional information about the range or restrictions on \\\\( z \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely recover the original \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → f(z); f(z) → observation; observation → intervention; intervention → z"
