  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\), defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). An external operation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Nt} \\\\) with \\\\( N \\\\) being another constant matrix, acts on the state space over time. The impact of this operation on the initial conditions and subsequent system behavior is studied.\n\nAssuming that a new operation \\\\( U(s) = e^{Dt}s \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time t_1 where D is a constant matrix, will the final state at t = T only depend on \\\\( L \\\\) and ignore influences from \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) as an intervention impacts the evolution trajectory, creating dependencies on matrices N, D, and M. These influences compound through matrix exponentials and linear transformations affecting the state at t = T significantly by altering scale, orientation, or other properties over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
