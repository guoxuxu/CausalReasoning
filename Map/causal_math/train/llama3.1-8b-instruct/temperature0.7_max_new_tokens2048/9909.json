  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves as per \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\) up to t = T without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be identical to the output had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) merely evolved for T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial modification by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 fundamentally alters the trajectory of evolution. \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) changes the magnitude of the initial condition, thus modifying how \\\\( z \\\\) develops through time under the influence of \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\), leading to a different state at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
