  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\dot{u} = Ku\\\\), with K being a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the variability introduced by matrix exponential transformations such as \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), the resulting endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved through multiple combinations of these transformations. This ambiguity, combined with the non-commutative nature of certain matrix operations, makes it challenging to uniquely identify specific interventions from the final outcome alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
