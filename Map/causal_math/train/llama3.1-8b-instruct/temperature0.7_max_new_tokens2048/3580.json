  "Problem": "Consider a domain in the complex plane where we evaluate the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dt \\\\), with C being a contour in the complex plane. We explore the effect of varying the parameter z and modifying the contour C.\n\nGiven the resulting integrand value from \\\\( I(z) \\\\) after some transformations and redefining of the contour, can we determine precisely which transformations or modifications occurred by knowing the final integral value alone?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant value of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) could emanate from various transformations and different contour modifications. The inherent ambiguity in deducing the specific changes, especially when considering complex integral transformations and the influence of undislosed intermediate transformations, makes this determination non-unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
