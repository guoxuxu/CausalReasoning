  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a real constant, over time \\\\( t \\\\) is scrutinized.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the dynamics given by \\\\( A \\\\) and not influenced by \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another level of modification via \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), affecting the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This makes the endpoint dependent not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but also significantly influenced by both \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), due to their contribution to the overall transformation of the system's trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
