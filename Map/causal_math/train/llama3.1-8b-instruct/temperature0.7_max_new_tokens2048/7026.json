  "Problem": "Consider the control of a heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) on a domain, where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a thermal diffusivity constant and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) denotes the Laplacian. An intervention involves changing boundary conditions at a specific time using a function \\\\( h(t,x) = e^{\\\\lambda t}g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is a spatial function.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we conclusively infer the initial temperature distribution at t=0 without knowing if \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\) was applied at the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(t,x) \\\\) at the outset, it is not feasible to uniquely reconstruct the initial state, as the boundary condition impacts the solution trajectory of the heat equation. Diverse scenarios can lead to the same temperature distribution at time T due to the continuous nature of the equation and possible variabilities in boundary dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
