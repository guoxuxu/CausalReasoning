  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a modification \\\\( M(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} cos(\\omega s) z(s) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the specific form of \\\\( M(z) \\\\) or \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M(z) \\\\) introduces additional terms in the transformation, making the final endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the particular forms and interactions of both \\\\( M(z) \\\\) and \\\\( T(z) \\\\), not merely on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
