  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We examine the implications of a functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the exact sequence of applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached through various paths of interventions given the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials in combination with matrix C. The lack of certainty in the commutation relations among C, D, and F, and knowing how exponential matrices multiply, leads to multiple potential intervention sequences yielding the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
