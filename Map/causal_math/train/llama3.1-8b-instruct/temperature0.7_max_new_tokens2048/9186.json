  "Problem": "Consider the integral equation of the form \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix determining the system's dynamics and f(s) is a vector function. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse on this system.\n\nCan we uniquely reconstruct the function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) from the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), if no information about the initial function modification (by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform gives us a potential function \\\\( y(t) \\\\), but without knowing the modifications applied to \\\\( f(s) \\\\) such as the scalar multiplication by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), multiple feasible functions \\\\( f(s) \\\\) could correspond to the same output, hampering unique reconstruction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
