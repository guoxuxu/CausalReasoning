  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially, any deductions about \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are unclear since the early application of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could alter \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a way that is not reconstructible simply from knowing the dynamics under \\\\( At \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
