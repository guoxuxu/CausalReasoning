  "Problem": "Consider the relationship between the input vector \\\\(x\\\\) and the output vector \\\\(y\\\\) in a linear system characterized by the matrix equation \\\\(y = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a transformation matrix in linear algebra. We explore the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) which alters \\\\(x\\\\) to \\\\(x' = T(x)\\\\) and examine its effects.\n\nGiven \\\\(y' = Lx'\\\\) where \\\\(x' = T(x)\\\\), can we deduce the original vector \\\\(x\\\\) accurately without information on whether transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied, recovering \\\\(x\\\\) from \\\\(x'\\\\) directly from \\\\(y'\\\\) is not feasible due to the potentially irreversible alteration of \\\\(x\\\\) by \\\\(T\\\\). The transformation can suppress or enhance different features in \\\\(x\\\\), leading to losing information about the original form of \\\\(x\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
