  "Problem": "Analyze the stability and behavior of a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation in the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\vec{u}\\\\) is the fluid velocity, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity. Consider the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{u}(t))\\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nIf we apply an external force \\\\(\\\\vec{f}\\\\) to the system at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), changing the equation to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} + \\\\vec{f}\\\\), does the transformed field \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\) purely reflect the original viscous properties of the fluid?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\(\\\\vec{f}\\\\) as an intervention changes the dynamics reflected in the Laplace domain. The transformed field \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\) will then also include effects from the external force, altering the characteristics that were solely attributed to viscosity and initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
