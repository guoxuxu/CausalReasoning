  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency of the system. We explore the effects of a linear transformation \\\\(T(x) = Ax + B\\\\), where A and B are matrices, on the system's state.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), we cannot reliably trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to the potential alteration caused by A and B. The system’s trajectory might have been significantly altered making it impossible to uniquely deduce the correct initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
