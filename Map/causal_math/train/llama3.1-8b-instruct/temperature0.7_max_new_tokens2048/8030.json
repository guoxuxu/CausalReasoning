  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The focus is on understanding the behavior of the inverse Laplace transform evaluated over different time intervals t and interpreting the effect of parameter s.\n\nGiven a decrease in the magnitude of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can it be inferred that the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) was increased without knowing initial values?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)'s magnitude could result from different factors, not just an increase in \\\\( s \\\\). Other unknown dynamics, such as changes in the domain of z or external influences on the integral evaluation, could also result in magnitude reduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "decrease in magnitude of f(z) → increased s; decrease in magnitude of f(z) → t; t → s"
