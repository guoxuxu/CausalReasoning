  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Here, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is described by the time-domain differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal or control function. The Fourier transform is taken with respect to the function after applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in terms of another transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ex \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied, will the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(T) \\\\} \\\\) for \\\\( T \\\\) > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( E \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive application of transformations \\\\( Dx \\\\) and later \\\\( Ex \\\\) will both influence the trajectory and thus the frequency components of the signal. Consequently, the Fourier transform at time \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect the effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( E \\\\). The compound transformations alter the state, and their consolidated impact will be observed in the frequency domain.",
