  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of the convolution operation using a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with its transform \\\\( K(s) \\\\), on the system function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t = t_1 using another convolution with a different kernel \\\\( k_1(t) \\\\), will the system's output at time t = T solely depend on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on the type of interventions applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using another kernel \\\\( k_1(t) \\\\) at t_1 will further modify the system by convolving with \\\\( k_1(t) \\\\), influencing and potentially altering the trajectory and final output of the system at t = T. Thus, the output depends on both the initial and intervened conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
