  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain, with boundary conditions defined by the prescription \\\\(u = g\\\\) on the boundary. An integral transformation \\\\(f(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u dt\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, is considered over a period [0, T].\n\nIf at some t=t1 (<T), a different integral transformation \\\\(g(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{t_1} e^{Bt}u dt\\\\) is applied as intervention, does the final form of \\\\(f(u)\\\\) at T only depend on the original Laplace's equation and not on the transformations A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations A and B will influence the final outcome. The intermediate intervention with \\\\(g(u)\\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system; thus, the final form of \\\\(f(u)\\\\) at T is dependent on the specifics of both A and B matrices as well as the underpinning dynamics of Laplace’s equation. Detailed properties of A and B, like commutativity, will affect the resulting function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace's equation → domain; domain → boundary conditions; boundary conditions → integral transformation f(u); integral transformation f(u) → transformation matrix A; integral transformation g(u) → transformation matrix B; integral transformation g(u) → t1; integral transformation g(u) → Laplace's equation; transformation matrix A → f(u); transformation matrix B → g(u); transformation matrix A → Laplace's equation; t1 → g(u); t1 → Laplace's equation"
