  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of a linear resistor and a capacitor. The charging of the capacitor over time t is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}(V-V_0)\\\\), where V is the voltage across the capacitor, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and \\\\(V_0\\\\) is the constant input voltage. To analyze the system, we explore the influence of a sinusoidal signal \\\\(A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) superimposed on the input voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\).\n\nSuppose at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention adjusts the resistance R in the circuit. Will the resultant voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the sinusoidal amplitude A added at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the resistance alters the RC time constant, which affects how the circuit responds both to the constant voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\) and the sinusoidal part. Thus, the output voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) depends on both the sine wave amplitude A and the new resistance value.",
