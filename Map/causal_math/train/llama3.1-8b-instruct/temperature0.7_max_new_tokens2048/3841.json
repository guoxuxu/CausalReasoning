  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where C is a complex constant, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the consequences of an integral transformation on this system, denoted by \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda (t-\\\\tau)} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a decay factor.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to progress under the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\) modifies the initial conditions by integrating with a decay factor, thus altering the signal's trajectory and its final state at T, making \\\\(z(T)\\\\) different from direct evolution of \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
