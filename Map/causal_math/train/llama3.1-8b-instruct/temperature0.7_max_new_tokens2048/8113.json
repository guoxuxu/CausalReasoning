  "Problem": "Consider a complex function integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an analytic function. We analyze how different transformations by \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) without and with interventions affect the transformed function.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and evolves over time without further transformation, will the Laplace domain representation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) be different from the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The result of Laplace transforming \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) to get \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\) remains unchanged unless additional transformations are applied. The nature of the Laplace transformation ensures that the outcome is dependent only on the initial function and not on time evolution as no time variable is involved post transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
