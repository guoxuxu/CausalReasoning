  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of a holomorphic transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is considered over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowledge the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention combinations can lead to the same result at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the non-injective nature of the transformations such as squaring and square root functions in the complex domain. Therefore, identical endpoints may arise from different sequences of interventions, creating ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
