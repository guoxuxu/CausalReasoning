  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing physical quantities. We consider the effects of applying a Fourier transform as an intervention, modifying the function to \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain.\n\nFrom observing the transformed function \\\\( Z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we determine which specific convolution operation (selection of kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) was applied in the time domain without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Distinguishing the specific convolution kernel solely from the frequency domain perspective, without further constraints or additional information, is challenging. Many different kernels could yield similar effects on the frequency domain characteristics depending on their shape, making it impossible to conclusively identify \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z'(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
