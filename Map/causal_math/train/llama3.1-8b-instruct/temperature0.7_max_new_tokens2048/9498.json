  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region where the velocity field is represented by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\). We are interested in analyzing the result of applying a rotational transformation described by the function \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on this velocity field over an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nCan the original orientation of the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\) be accurately deduced from observing the flow at time T if the rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 but we are unaware of it?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or even the occurrence of the rotation, the original alignment of the velocity field cannot be precisely reconstructed from observations made at time T. Information about the original configuration is lost due to the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
