  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between complex functions and their integral transformations, specifically considering a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Does causal inference change with or without the presence of transformational modifications or interventions?\n\nGiven the transformed representation \\\\( L(g)(s) \\\\), can we explicitly determine whether the intervention \\\\( t^2 \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) just by examining \\\\( L(g)(s) \\\\), without additional information about the original function or the nature of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( L(g)(s) \\\\) does not explicitly reveal if \\\\( t^2 \\\\) was the intervention unless prior information about \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) or the specific intervention nature is known. The output could result from various different functions and transformations, making it indistinguishable without extra context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
