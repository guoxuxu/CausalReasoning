  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation of the form \\\\( y(x) = \\int_0^x K(x, t) y(t) dt + f(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a known function. We analyze the changes in function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) when a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) characterized by operator \\\\( L[y] = y + g \\\\), where \\\\( g \\\\) is an additional function, is applied to the integral equation.\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\( x_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( M[y] = cy \\\\) (multiplicative scalar operation) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting terminal function \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > x_1 \\\\) rely only on the kernel \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) rather than on the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M[y] \\\\) introduces a scalar multiplication that affects the solutions differently depending on prior transformations (like \\\\( L \\\\)), altering the effect of the kernel \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\). This makes \\\\( y(T) \\\\) dependent on the cumulative effects of \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and the kernel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
