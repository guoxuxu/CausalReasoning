  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nUpon observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was potentially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the known properties of D and its association with L through K, it is possible to reverse the transformation and the natural evolution of the system to compute back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), assuming \\\\( z(T) = K^{-1}e^{LT}K z_0 \\\\), implying \\\\( z_0 = K e^{-LT} K^{-1} z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
