  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\), obeying the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = Au \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = Bv \\), respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\) on this complex function over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\), can we precisely identify whether the transformations \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) or \\( \\mathcal{S} \\), or both were applied during the evolution, based solely on the knowledge of \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\) could result from various combinations of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{S} \\) due to the integral nature of these transformations blending the influences of \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) in ways that are not directly separable or traceable to individual interventions, introducing significant interpretational uncertainty.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
