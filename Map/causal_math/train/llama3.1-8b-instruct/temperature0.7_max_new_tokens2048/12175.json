  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We investigate the effect of the complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine explicitly which interventions were applied (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects due to the exponential nature of matrix transformations and their possible non-commuting properties complicates uniquely backtracking the interventions. Different combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) might yield the same final state because the exponential transformations can have overlapping effects that do not uniquely specify their origins.

  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
