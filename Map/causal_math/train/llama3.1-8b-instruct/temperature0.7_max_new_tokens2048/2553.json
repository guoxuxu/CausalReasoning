  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the resulting function is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) changes the initial conditions of the temperature distribution by scaling \\\\( u_0 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\). This modifies the subsequent evolution of the distribution according to the heat equation, leading to different temperature distributions at any time T compared to just evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
