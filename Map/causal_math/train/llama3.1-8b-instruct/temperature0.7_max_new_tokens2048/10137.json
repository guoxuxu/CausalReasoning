  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit that involves a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series connected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The relationship between the current (I) and the voltage (V) across the circuit can be modeled using a differential equation \\\\( V - L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} - RI = 0 \\\\). We are also interested in the impact of a Laplace Transform on this differential equation.\n\nIf the voltage source V is suddenly switched from a constant voltage to a sinusoidal voltage at t = 0, and no further changes are made to the circuit, will the current I(t) necessarily stabilize at the same sinusoidal frequency as the voltage?",
  "Explanation": "Switching V to a sinusoidal input in a linear differential equation system leads to a steady-state response where the current I(t) must also oscillate sinusoidally at the same frequency due to the system's linearity and the sinusoidal steady-state response of linear circuits.",
