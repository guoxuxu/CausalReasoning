  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the result of the integral transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), can we determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) influences the imaginary part of the transform, but without specific knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\\\), particularly \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\), it's not feasible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since multiple frequencies could yield similar effects depending on the decay rate induced by \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
