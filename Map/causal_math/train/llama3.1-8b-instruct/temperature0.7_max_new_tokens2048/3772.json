  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nGiven the final result after applying both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformation was applied first just by the output at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint results from a combination and integration of transformations, and these transformations' effects overlap in the time domain. Without distinct markers or non-overlapping effects from each, it's impossible to untangle which transformation was applied first. The integrals mingle the influences of each transformation, obscuring their order and individual impact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → z(t); t → z(t); z(t) → T[z(t)]; U[z(t)] → z(t); T[z(t)] → z(t); T[z(t)] → U[z(t)]"
