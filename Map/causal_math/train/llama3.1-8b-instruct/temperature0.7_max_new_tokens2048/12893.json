  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a scalar field, and \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant vector. We investigate the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) evolved from the transformed initial condition, can we deduce the form of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) evolved from a transformed or non-transformed initial condition, determining the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) would require knowledge about whether or not the Fourier transform was applied. The transformed initial condition might evolve differently compared to the original scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
