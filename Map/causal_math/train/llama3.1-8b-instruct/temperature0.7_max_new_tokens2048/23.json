  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\Delta z\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We also introduce a transformation function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int e^{-sD}z ds\\\\), assumed to act on the system at a specific point.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention in the form of a function \\\\(j(z) = z + k\\\\) (where k is a constant vector), is applied, will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) solely depend on D and not on the effects of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) or \\\\(j(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is affected by both the initial transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and the mid-point intervention \\\\(j(z)\\\\), along with the natural dynamics dictated by D. Both interventions potentially alter the trajectory and hence the final state, adding layers of complexity beyond just the diffusion process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The diffusion coefficient D directly influences the Laplacian operator Δ, which in turn directly influences z, and z directly influences the transformation function h, which in turn directly influences z, and z directly influences the intervention function j, which directly influences both z and the final state z(T)."
