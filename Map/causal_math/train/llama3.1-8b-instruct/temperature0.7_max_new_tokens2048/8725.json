  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) on a vector \\\\( v \\\\) in a vector space, where A is a constant matrix. Assessing the role of an additive perturbation \\\\( g(v) = v + w \\\\) applied to this transformation, where \\\\( w \\\\) is another constant vector.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\) to a vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\), and then let it evolve under a dynamical system \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( v_0 \\\\) was directly evolved using only \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) changes the initial state \\\\( v_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Av_0 \\\\). Thus, the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) from \\\\( Av_0 \\\\) yields a different trajectory than that from \\\\( v_0 \\\\), unless A commutes with B or is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
