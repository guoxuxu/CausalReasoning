  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving under the influence of a potential field governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\). The potential field is perturbed by an added magnetic field, described by a vector potential \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\). The effect of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) is represented through the transformation \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t) = \\\\vec{A} \\\\times \\\\vec{x}\\\\) at time t.\n\nIf the initial trajectory of the particle is perturbed by applying \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t)\\\\) at t = 0, and it is then allowed to evolve in the electric field \\\\(\\\\nabla V\\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory at t = T be the same as if \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t)\\\\) had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the magnetic vector potential perturbation modifies the initial momentum of the particle, altering its trajectory. Even though \\\\(\\\\nabla V\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) might individually lead to conservative fields, their combined effect via the cross product can create non-conservative systemic changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
