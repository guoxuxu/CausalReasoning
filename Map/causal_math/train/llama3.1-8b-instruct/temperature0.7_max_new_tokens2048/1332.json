  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\), can we definitively determine the types of interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) applied by observing only \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Various combinations of transformations and interventions could reach the same final point \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\), especially considering the oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and transformations that may offset or modify these oscillations. Thus, it is impossible to uniquely identify which interventions, if any, were applied without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
