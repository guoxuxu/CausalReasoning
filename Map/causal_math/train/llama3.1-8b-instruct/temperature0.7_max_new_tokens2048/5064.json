  "Problem": "Consider a multivariable control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(x) = D \\\\exp(Mt)x \\\\), with D being another constant matrix, is applied to manipulate the system state over time t.\n\nCan we decipher exactly which interventions (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or any other) were applied just by knowing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), given multiple possible interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the type of interventions used based solely on the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is highly ambiguous without further information. The overlapping effects of matrix exponentials under non-commutative operations mean multiple intervention combinations can lead to the same end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
