  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We study the effect of a linear transformation of variables defined by the matrix \\\\( T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} P & Q \\\\\\\\ R & S \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), applied initially at time t = 0.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( z'(0) = Tz(0) \\\\) and subsequently letting the system evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) lead to the same state at time t = T as if the transformation was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation matrix \\\\( T \\\\) alters the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) which affects the overall trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Given the differential governing equations, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will diverge from the trajectory of an untransformed initial state, affected by the matrix components P, Q, R, and S.",
