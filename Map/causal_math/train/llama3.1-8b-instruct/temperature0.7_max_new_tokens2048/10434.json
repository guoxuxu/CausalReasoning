  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u + iv \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + cz^2 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are constants. We explore the behavior when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t in [0, T], based solely on the knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at some T > t, without knowing the initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the entire original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information. The transformation involves an integration that inherently loses some information about the specific values that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) took on over the interval [0, T].",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
