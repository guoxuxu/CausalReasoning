  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly what transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied at earlier times solely from \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integration and exponential manipulations involving constants A, B, and C, the endpoints could align under various combinations of transformations, obscuring the exact historical sequence of interventions applied to the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
