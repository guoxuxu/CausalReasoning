  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is applied to transform a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) via the integral \\( G(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{az} g(z) \\, dz \\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number, and the transformation explores how changes in \\\\( a \\\\) affect the outcome of the integral transformation.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( G(a) \\\\) of the integral transformation, can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) without knowing the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( G(a) \\\\) does not uniquely specify \\\\( a \\\\) because different parameters can lead to similar transformations, especially without precise knowledge of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( a \\\\) could result in functionally similar outputs depending on the properties of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
