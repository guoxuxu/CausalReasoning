  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively. Here, A and B are real constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is considered in the analysis.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at a specific time t_0 within [0, T], will the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from 0 to T depend solely on the pre-intervention behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time t_0 modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at and post t_0, thus affecting the entire integrative outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from t_0 to T. This change directly influences the computed value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making it dependent not just on the original behaviors of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), but also on the changes induced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
