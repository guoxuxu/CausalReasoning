  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. We evaluate the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z + S \\\\), where R and S are also complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied initially, it modifies the complex state by \\\\( e^{RT}z_0 + S \\\\), which changes the trajectory of the evolution. Since both R and S can influence the course and final state, the outcome at time T will distinctly differ from the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
