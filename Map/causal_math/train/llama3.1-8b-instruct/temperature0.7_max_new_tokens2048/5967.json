  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system described by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is defined in the complex domain. Let's analyze an intervention using an inverse mapping \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is another complex function.\n\nIf an intervention via an inverse transform \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) be a straightforward combination of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), unaffected by the structure of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state after applying the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\) will generally involve a convolution or composite effect between \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), determined by interaction terms or convolution integral, depending on the specifics of the Laplace transforms involved. The output state is affected by both \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
