  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\} = U(s, x) \\\\) and the subsequent inversion to the time domain.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at some time T > t_1, after an intervention was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine whether the original or the post-intervention condition had more influence on the final state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear accumulation and propagation of effects from both the initial and boundary conditions (intervention) through the system's dynamics, it is often impossible to isolately attribute the conditions impacting \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\). The solution at T inherently integrates influences from all past conditions and interventions without a clear distinction of their relative impacts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t_1 → intervention; intervention → u(T, x); u(t_1, x) → u(T, x); t_1 → u(t_1, x); u(t_1, x) → u(T, x)"
