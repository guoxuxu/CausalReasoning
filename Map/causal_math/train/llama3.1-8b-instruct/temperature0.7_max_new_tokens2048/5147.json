  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We study the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) influenced by matrices A, B, C, and D. These matrices through their exponential transformations can substantially alter the trajectory and thus the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
