  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and we examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. This scenario explores the transformations under different conditions and interventions using the residue theorem from complex analysis.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed, will this result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and transforming the result using \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation before or after the function yields different results due to the non-commutative nature of addition and exponentiation in the complex plane. Specifically, \\\\( f(T(z_0)) = e^{az_0 + b} \\\\) which does not equal to \\\\( T(f(z_0)) = ae^{z_0} + b \\\\), thus changing the nature of the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
