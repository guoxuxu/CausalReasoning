  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a system governed by the convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specified as \\\\( y(t) = x(t) \\\\ast h(t) \\\\). Consider two functions, \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h_2(t) = t \\\\ast h_1(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by integrating it (\\\\( \\\\int x(t) dt \\\\)) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in a system with impulse response \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\), will the final output still be equivalent to processing \\\\( \\\\int x(t) dt \\\\) through \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integration of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) as an intervention introduces a different transformation, and the convolution with \\\\( h_1(t) \\\\) versus \\\\( h_2(t) \\\\) subsequently processes this altered signal differently. The initial integration shifts the frequency components of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), subsequently affecting how the signal interacts with each impulse response distinctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
