  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}(t-s)p(s)ds \\\\), and where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is the input signal. The integral kernel \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) represents the system's response to the input, transitioning over time.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a fixed function and evolves naturally until time T without any external intervention, does the nature of the kernel \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) alone decide the output function \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the behavior of the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T solely depends on the input function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and the kernel \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). Since there's no alteration in this relationship through external means in this situation, the output is directly determined by these two components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel e^(At) determines the output function z(T) directly through its integral transformation, regardless of the input signal p(t), since p(t) is a fixed function."
