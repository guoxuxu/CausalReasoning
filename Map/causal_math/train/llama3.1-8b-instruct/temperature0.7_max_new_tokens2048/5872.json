  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a control system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu \\\\) where \\\\(D\\\\) is a dynamics matrix and \\\\(B\\\\) is a control matrix. We study the influence of applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(Cx) \\\\) where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix to the state vector \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(x), h(x) \\\\), or both), only by observing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interplay of non-linear and potentially non-commutative transformations applied at different stages, multiple scenarios could yield the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents uniquely identifying the interventions used solely based on the state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
