  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time and \\\\( s \\\\) the complex frequency domain. We focus on the causal effect of inversion by considering the inverse Laplace transform to recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and examining the impact of additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after applying both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and an unknown potential intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we exactly determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the interventions(\\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) reflects cumulative modifications by both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and potentially \\\\( h(t) \\\\), depending on its specific form (e.g., exponential decay functions). Disentangling these effects to retrieve the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and identify specific interventions correctly is complex and non-unique due to similar transformations leading to similar \\\\( F(s) \\\\) outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
