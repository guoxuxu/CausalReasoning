  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new function \\\\( g(T) = e^{kT} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is made, will the end temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the linear coefficient k and not on any transformations applied before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(T) = e^{kT} \\\\) introduces a significant change based on the current temperature at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which is affected by any prior transformations like \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\). Hence, the final temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) depends on both the initial transformation and the exponential intervention, as well as the inherent dynamics given by k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
