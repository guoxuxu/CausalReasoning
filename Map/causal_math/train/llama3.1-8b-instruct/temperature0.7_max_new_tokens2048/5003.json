  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + a u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x, t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-ks} u(x, s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( S[u](x, t) = u(x, t) + c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the result \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the initial PDE and not on the transformations \\\\( T[u] \\\\) or \\\\( S[u] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operation \\\\( S[u] \\\\) alters the state of the system by adding a constant to the solution of the PDE. This change will be reflected through the integral transform \\\\( T[u] \\\\), which accumulates the modified values, making \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) dependent on the effects of both \\\\( T[u] \\\\) and \\\\( S[u] \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
