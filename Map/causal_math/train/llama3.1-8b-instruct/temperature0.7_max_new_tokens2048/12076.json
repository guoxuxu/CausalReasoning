  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the differential equations system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z represents a complex variable associated with time t. We analyze the system transformation under the integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i \\\\omega s} ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to the system at t = 0 and let the system evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) without intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T represent the same final state as if we had let the system evolve from t = 0 to T under just \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the system initially by adding a complex integral term to the state, which interacts with the system matrix A. This initial modification alters the trajectory of the system, and hence, the state at t = T will be fundamentally different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
