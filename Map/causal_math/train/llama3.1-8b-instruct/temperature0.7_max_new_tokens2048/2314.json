  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int K(x,y,t) u(y,t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), the changes induced by the kernel function K in the integral transform make it impossible to uniquely recover \\\\( u_0(x,0) \\\\), especially if the kernel and operator L are not trivially related.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
