  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t=0 modifies the initial condition by rotating \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by an angle \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\cdot 0 \\\\). However, as the system evolves, the additional rotation introduced by the transformation affects the trajectory. Therefore, each point along the path from t=0 to t=T will be rotated by \\\\( \\\\omega t \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory and endpoint compared to unmodified evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
