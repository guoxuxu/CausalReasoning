  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant. The causal implications are explored by applying a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) to the system.\n\nIf an intervention changes \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) to a new value \\\\( \\\\lambda' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) still reflect the original parameter \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention altering \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\lambda' \\\\) fundamentally changes the system's state trajectory from the moment of intervention onwards. Thus, the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will reflect the new parameter \\\\( \\\\lambda' \\\\), not the original \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
