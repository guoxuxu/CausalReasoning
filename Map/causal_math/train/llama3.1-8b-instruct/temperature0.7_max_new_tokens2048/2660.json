  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) represents the influence of noise, which could be stochastic in nature. We explore the effect of introducing a control operation given by \\\\(g(z) = Dz\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nFrom observing the final state at \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely identify whether the control operation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) was applied at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The inherent randomness introduced by \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) and potential similar effects from different timings or magnitudes of applying \\\\(D\\\\) contribute to a scenario where multiple histories could lead to the same observed state at \\\\(T\\\\). This uncertainty prevents a definitive identification of the intervention timeline or presence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
