  "Problem": "Consider a matrix function \\( z(t) \\) associated with a complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), where \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). We examine how an eigenvalue transformation \\( F(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) affects \\( z(t) \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( G(z) = e^{\\mu t}z \\) (where \\( \\mu \\) is a constant complex) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on \\( \\lambda \\) or \\( \\mu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) will be influenced by both \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) along with the original system dynamics governed by \\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\). The exponential terms introduced by \\( F(z) \\) and \\( G(z) \\) add compound effects that affect \\( z(T) \\)'s trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
