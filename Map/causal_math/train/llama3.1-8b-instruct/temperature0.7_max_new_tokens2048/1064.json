  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences of the exponential transformations applied through \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) can lead to equivalent endpoints due to the non-linear interaction introduced by the differential equation. The overlapping effects of exponential growth make isolating specific interventions based solely on \\( z(T) \\) impractical.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
