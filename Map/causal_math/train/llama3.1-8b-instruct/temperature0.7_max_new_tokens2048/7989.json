  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0, and the function is allowed to evolve naturally, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane still represent a unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) results in \\\\( z(t) = (e^{it})^n = e^{int} \\\\). This alters the frequency of traversal around the circle, effectively modifying the rate at which the circle is traversed but not altering the path's shape. Hence, although the path remains a circle, the changed frequency means the trajectory, in terms of time to complete one full circle, is different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
