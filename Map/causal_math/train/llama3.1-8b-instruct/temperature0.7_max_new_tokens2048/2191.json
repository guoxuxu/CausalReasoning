  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention involving a filtering operation defined by \\\\( H(f) \\\\) in the frequency domain is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L but not on the characteristics of \\\\( H(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( H(f) \\\\) affects the system's dynamics in the frequency domain, altering the end state after inverse transformation. This change is dependent on L and the filter characteristics, indicating the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}x(T) \\\\) is influenced by both factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
