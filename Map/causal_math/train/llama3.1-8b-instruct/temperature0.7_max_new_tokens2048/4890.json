  "Problem": "We consider a dual-space system where two functions are defined: \\\\( f(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\\\) (Laplace Transform) and \\\\( g(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i t x} \\, dt \\\\) (Fourier Transform). Let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represent an input signal evolving over time.\n\nHaving the result of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at hand, can it always be exclusively determined whether this result was obtained solely by the Laplace transform without any pre-computation based modifications on \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of similar transformations in output, similar to an Inverse Laplace condition, might confuse the identification process unless additional information about the initial conditions or the system's nature is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
