  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the charge \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) on a capacitor evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{Q} = -\\\\frac{Q}{RC} + I(t) \\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is an external current source. We examine the impact of modifying the circuit by changing the resistance to a new value \\\\( R' \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf, at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a controlled current pulse described by an additional function \\\\( J(t) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( Q(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on the initial resistance R and not on \\\\( R' \\\\) or the pulse parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the current pulse \\\\( J(t) \\\\) alters the input current thereby affecting the charge dynamics, making the final state \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) dependent not just on R but also on \\\\( R' \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The change in resistance and the dynamics of the pulse contribute to the rate and behavior of charging or discharging.",
