  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system controlled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = r(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\), where \\\\( r(t) \\\\) is the amplitude and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) is the phase. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) with a complex constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is considered over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system is then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T match the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) not transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) changes the initial condition by modifying both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Hence, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from that new initial condition will be altered both in growth rate and rotation, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
