  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) governing a system, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\) is applied to transform the function over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) after knowing \\\\( F(T) \\\\) without any change or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Under the assumptions of linearity and non-degeneracy of A, the inverse Fourier transform can recover \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\), allowing us to compute \\\\( x(0) \\\\). This recovery assumes that A's eigenvalues do not cause information loss during transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
