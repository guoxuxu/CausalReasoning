  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop feedback system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) is the control input. We are examining the system's behavior under the integral transformation given by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(K+L)s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system operates under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to that obtained by simply evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) influences the initial conditions by integrating matrix exponential effects over time, thereby altering the trajectory of the system. The integration affects how \\\\( x \\) evolves, diverging from the trajectory of simply evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
