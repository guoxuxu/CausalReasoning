  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nCan the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without auxiliary information about the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\), multiple input signals could potentially yield the same output, leading to an ambiguity in determining \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The kernel's properties are crucial in defining the transformation's mapping from input to output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
