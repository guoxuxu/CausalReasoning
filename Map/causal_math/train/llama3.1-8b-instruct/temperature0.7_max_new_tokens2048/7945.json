  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), commonly known as the heat equation, where D is a diffusion constant. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation given by \\\\( g(u_0) = u_0 + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a function representing a heat source distribution.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u_0) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and the system evolves according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) alone was evolved using the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to the initial condition modifies the initial temperature profile, which influences how the heat will diffuse over time. Since \\\\( h(x) \\\\) adds extra heat in specific areas, the temperature profile at any later time T will be different from that obtained by evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
