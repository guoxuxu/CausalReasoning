  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing an electric voltage across a resistor in a circuit, governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\). The influence of the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is examined to understand the circuit's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately deduce the exact transformations (Laplace transform, \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or their combinations) applied throughout the timeline, just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of transformations and their parameters. Without additional temporal data or constraints, the specific sequence and nature of interventions (like the presence of the Laplace transform, \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\)) applied until t = T cannot be uniquely determined due to the overlapping influences and non-unique decompositions in transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
