  "Problem": "Investigate the system behavior under the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( b \\\\) is a vector. We study its response when manipulated with the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z + d \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a matrix and \\\\( d \\\\) is a vector, over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan the exact nature of interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), their timing, and parameters like \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\)) be determined solely from the knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from multiple potential intervention strategies, timings, and parameter configurations due to the linearity and possible overlapping effects of the transformations. This indistinguishability makes it impossible to uniquely identify the precise nature of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
