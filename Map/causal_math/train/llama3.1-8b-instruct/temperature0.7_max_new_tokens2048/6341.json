  "Problem": "Examine a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), affects the system's evaluation over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) and the transformed function is then evolved according to the modified equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial s} = \\\\mathcal{L}(L(u))\\\\), will the inverse transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,T)\\\\) at time T yield the same result as evolving \\\\(u_0\\\\) directly under the original PDE to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform changes the domain of the problem and modifies how the differential operator L acts in the transformed space. When evolving \\\\(\\\\hat{u}\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(L(u))\\\\), and then applying the inverse Laplace transform, the interaction effects in the transformed domain can lead to different outcomes than direct evolution under the original PDE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
