  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time control system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We investigate the role of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, in influencing the state evolution over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), uncertainties around the influence of M make it impossible to uniquely back-calculate to \\\\(x_0\\\\) using solely matrix A, because the transformation may have significantly altered initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
