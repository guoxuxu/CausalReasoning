  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) describing a dynamical system's behavior in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, modifying the function's phase.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under its differential equations without any further intervention, will the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the native system equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially modifies the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a different initial condition. Since the system's evolution depends sensitively on initial conditions, especially given the complex interactions between \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), the trajectory and thus the final state at time T will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
