  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final transformation in the Laplace domain for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only reflect the change in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the initial value?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\), thus changing the entire function to \\\\( e^{i(\\omega+\\delta)t} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\). This subsequently changes the transformed function to \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{e^{-(s - i(\\omega + \\delta))t_1}}{s - i(\\omega + \\delta)} \\\\), showing dependencies on both the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the modified \\\\( \\delta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
