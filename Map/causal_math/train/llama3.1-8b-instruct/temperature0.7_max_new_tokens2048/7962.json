  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(g(x)) \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), which is subsequently evolved via Laplace transform \\\\( L(h(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\) over time variable t.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) accurately from the output after sequentially applying the Fourier and then the Laplace transform, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of Fourier and Laplace transforms fundamentally alters the function's domain and form, making it complex (and in most clinical cases, impossible) to uniquely reverse both transformations accurately without additional context about the initial conditions or form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Fourier transform F(g(x)) → Producing a transformed function F(g(x)); Applying Laplace transform L(h(t)) → Producing a transformed function L(h(t)); Applying Laplace transform L(h(t)) → Time variable t; Fourier transform F(g(x)) → Frequency domain representation; g(x) → Function g(x); F(g(x)) → Input for Laplace transform L(h(t))"
