  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt\\\\) where z is a complex variable and f(t) represents a real-valued function of t. This integral transform is fundamental in solving differential equations and analyzing signal systems.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is modified to \\\\(f(t) + h(t)\\\\) at t = 0, where \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is another function, and the integral transformation is applied to the new function without further intervention, will the resulting function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) be the same as if only \\\\(f(t)\\\\) was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by adding \\\\(h(t)\\\\) changes the integrand in the defined transformation, leading to a different result for \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Since the transform is a linear operator, \\\\(u(z)\\\\) for \\\\(f(t) + h(t)\\\\) will be \\\\(u(z) + v(z)\\\\), where \\\\(v(z)\\\\) is the transformation of \\\\(h(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
