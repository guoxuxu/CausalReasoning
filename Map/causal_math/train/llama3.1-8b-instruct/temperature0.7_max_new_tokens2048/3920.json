  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) applied in a calculus context on a closed contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of various transformations and integrations of the function over the contour.\n\nCan we determine the specific nature of interventions (original function or transformations) purely from knowing the integral result over contour \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral result over the complex contour does not uniquely determine the path of interventions used unless additional constraints or properties of the functions are known. The nature of complex integrals allows different functions and transformations to yield similar or identical results, hence the original path cannot be uniquely identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
