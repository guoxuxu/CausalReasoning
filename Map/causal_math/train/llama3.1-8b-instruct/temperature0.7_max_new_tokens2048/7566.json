  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\), can we reconstruct the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) accurately without knowing the parameter s?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral transformation incorporates the complex exponential factor depending on s, and without knowledge of s, it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as the transformation involves integration over an entire trace of the system's evolution, losing specific time-localized information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
