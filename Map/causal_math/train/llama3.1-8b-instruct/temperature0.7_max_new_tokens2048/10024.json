  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 5 \\\\). We deploy an operator transformation \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^z t dt \\\\) over the domain of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( T \\\\) applied on either \\\\( f(x) \\\\) or after intervening and applying it on \\\\( g(x) \\\\), can we specify which function was used just by analyzing the result of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity in interpreting the outcome of \\\\( T \\\\) stems from its integral transformation properties, which aggregate the polynomial details into a single output. Both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the intervened \\\\( g(x) \\\\) might produce similar integral results depending on their defined intervals and polynomial coefficients, making it challenging to discern from the outcome alone which function was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
