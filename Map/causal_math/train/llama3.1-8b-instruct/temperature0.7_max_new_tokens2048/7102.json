  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time t under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lz = z' + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), the changes imposed by the integral transformation, including potential damping or amplification depending on \\\\( a \\\\), lead to multiple possible initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\) that could yield the same observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
