  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\( V(t) \\) is transformed by a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) resulting in \\( V(s) \\). The transformed system is characterized by the impulse response function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s + R} \\), where \\( R \\) is a resistance in the circuit. The transformation represents an operation over the input voltage.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new component is added to the circuit thereby modifying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( H'(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+C)(s+R)} \\) (where \\( C \\) is an additional circuit element) as an intervention, will the new output \\( V_{out}(s) \\) for \\( s = R \\) depend solely on \\( R \\) and not on \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new component \\( C \\) modifies the impulse response to \\( H'(s) \\). Consequently, the output voltage \\( V_{out}(s) \\) at \\( s = R \\) is a result of the interaction between the original impulse function \\( H(s) \\) and the new component \\( H'(s) \\), thus dependent on both \\( R \\) and \\( C \\), not just \\( R \\).",
