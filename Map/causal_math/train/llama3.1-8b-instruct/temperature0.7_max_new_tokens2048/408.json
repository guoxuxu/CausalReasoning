  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit containing a resistor, inductor, and capacitor (RLC circuit) where the voltage input \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a function defined by \\\\( V(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), with A and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being constants. We analyze how the transformation defined by the Laplace transform affects the circuit's response over time.\n\nGiven the observed current \\\\( i(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which input was used (whether \\\\( V(t) \\\\), \\\\( U(t) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( i(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same current \\\\( i(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different inputs because of how the system’s impedance affects different frequency components in the inputs. The overlap in the frequency response of the circuit obscures the ability to distinguish between \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and \\\\( U(t) \\\\) or a combination thereof.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "V(t) → V(s); V(t) → i(t); U(t) → V(t); V(s) → i(s); i(t) → i(s); i(s) → i(T); V(s) → i(s) → i(T)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The input voltage V(t) influences the current i(t), and the Laplace transform of V(t) influences the Laplace transform of i(t), which in turn influences the current i(T) at time T."
