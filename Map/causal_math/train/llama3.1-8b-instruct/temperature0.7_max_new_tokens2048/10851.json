  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) is a constant. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) versus simply evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nAssuming another transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u) \\\\) representing a Laplace transform is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be dependent only on the nature of the original PDE and not on the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using the Laplace transform alters the system's properties by changing the domain and potentially the nature of solutions. Coupled with the earlier Fourier transform, the final state at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depends on the effects of both transforms, each influencing how the solution evolves.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
