  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional transformation subject to the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)) when applied to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\\\\\, where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at some point during the transformation (prior to applying \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)), a modification is introduced such as changing the variable (e.g., substituting \\\\( s \\\\) with \\\\( s + a \\\\) in the transformed equation), will the final solution reflect only the original constants \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) of the ODE?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention such as modifying the transformed equation's variable alters the final solution once the Inverse Laplace Transform is applied. This modification changes the characteristics of the solution, reflecting the intervention's effect (variable change) along with characteristics determined by the original constants \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Original ODE (p, q) → Laplace Transform → Modified equation (p, q, a) → Inverse Laplace Transform → Solution (p, q, a); Original ODE (p, q) → Laplace Transform → Inverse Laplace Transform → Solution (p, q)"
