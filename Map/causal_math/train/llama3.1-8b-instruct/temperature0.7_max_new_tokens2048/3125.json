  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain z as \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) for a constant c. Analyze how the Laplace transform impacts this function when converted using an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is transformed into the Laplace domain without any modifications, does the Laplace transform, represented as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), uniquely correspond to the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) involves an integral transformation that encapsulates all values over an infinite range, potentially losing information about the individual behavior at specific points, thus not uniquely representing the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
