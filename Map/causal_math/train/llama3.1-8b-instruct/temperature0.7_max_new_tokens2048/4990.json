  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) applied to a function \\( f(x) \\). We analyze various scenarios where \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\), and ‘a’ is a real constant, to understand the impact of this transformation on the system.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\( f(x) \\) after observing its Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) at time T without knowing if \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( F(k) \\) after transforming a function that could be \\( f(x) \\) or \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\), it's impossible to deterministically conclude the original function due to the potential modulation effect introduced by \\( e^{ax} \\). The frequency shift complicates backward inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
