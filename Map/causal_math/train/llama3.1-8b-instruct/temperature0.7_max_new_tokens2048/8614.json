  "Problem": "Assume we are dealing with a circuit system characterized by a linear transformation given by a matrix product \\\\( R = MC \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix representing the Maxwell's equations and \\\\( C \\\\) represents electrical properties of materials like capacitance and resistance.\n\nAfter observing the response matrix \\\\( R \\\\) at a later time, can we precisely trace back to determine the initial material properties matrix \\\\( C \\\\) without any changes or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) representing Maxwell's equations is known and hasn't changed, and since no interventions are applied, one can utilize the observed \\\\( R \\\\) to reliably calculate back to the initial \\\\( C \\\\), relying simply on their multiplicative relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
