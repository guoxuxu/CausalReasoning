  "Problem": "Examine the response of a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Consider applying the Fourier transform \\\\(F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) to the function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and then analyzing its evolution under a given boundary condition transformation.\n\nGiven the final state of \\\\(f(x, y, t = T)\\\\), can we determine precisely if an intervention (like applying a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\)) took place, merely by knowing the state at \\\\(T\\\\) and not whether a Fourier transform was performed?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity in the effects induced by the Fourier transform and any subsequent linear transformations does not allow for a clear, unambiguous reconstruction of whether an operator \\\\(L\\\\) was necessarily applied. The overlapping effects of transform and intervention create multiple plausible scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → transformed function; boundary condition transformation → transformed boundary condition; Laplace equation → solution f(x, y); intervention (L) → change in solution f(x, y); solution f(x, y) → Fourier transform; boundary condition transformation → solution f(x, y); solution f(x, y, t = T) → final state; intervention (L) → change in solution f(x, y, t = T); final state → information about solution f(x, y, t = T)"
