  "Problem": "Analyze a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) is considered as an intervention on the system, with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) uniquely by observing the value of \\\\( f(T) \\\\) at \\\\( z = T \\\\) without knowing anything about potential interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( f(T) \\\\) without detail on interventions lacks the context of whether transformations construed by matrices like \\\\( B \\\\) were applied or not. Without such knowledge, reconstructing \\\\( A \\\\) exactly is uncertain as similar effects could be mimicked by different matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
