  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(f(x, y) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)\\\\) and \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\) are harmonic functions. The transformation considered here is the complex exponential transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\).\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a point \\\\(z_0\\\\) and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^z\\\\) changes the initial value of the system by applying the exponential map, which affects the trajectory under the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = az\\\\). Thus, the state at any time T will differ from the case where the initial state was not transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
