  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIs it possible to infer the exact initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the result observed at t = T could originate from different initial conditions, particularly if F impacts the system in a non-trivial way that cannot be simply reversed from observing the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
