  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original constant \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) applies a complex exponential function to the initial conditions, complicating reversion since multiple values for \\\\( w \\\\) can map to the same point in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
