  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) after applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and a spontaneous intervention of \\\\( u(s) \\\\) at some unknown time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), can we uniquely determine the time \\\\( s_1 \\\\) of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform mixes the effects of the original function and the intervention, making it challenging to reverse engineer the exact time of intervention solely from the end result, as the contributions of both parts to the integral are fused into a single value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
