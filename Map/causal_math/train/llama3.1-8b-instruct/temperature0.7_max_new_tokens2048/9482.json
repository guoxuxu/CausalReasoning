  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. To study its behavior, we introduce an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) of the function.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by inverse-transforming the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) if no additional information on intervention is provided?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) transformation for linear systems with unique initial conditions. By performing the inverse Laplace transform, we can retrieve the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) precisely, assuming no external intervention alters the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
