  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system dynamics are modified at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by changing A to a new constant \\\\( B \\\\), and the input function u(t) is also changed at that time, will the Fourier-transformed state of the system at a later time t depend exclusively on the new dynamics and new input?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier-transformed state depends on the entire history of the system including the effects of the original dynamics characterized by A prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), as well as the impacts of the intervention with new dynamics B and the changed input function. This history impacts the frequency components and their phases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → x; u(t) → x; U(s) → x; h(t) → x; t1 → A; t1 → u(t); t1 → x; x → Fourier-transformed state of the system; B → x; new u(t) → x"
