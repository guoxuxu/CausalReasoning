  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform in space, given by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi,t)\\\\), on the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what changes in thermal conductivity occurred (whether \\\\(k\\\\) was changed to \\\\(k'\\\\), or remained constant), solely by knowing the value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) does not uniquely indicate whether or how \\\\(k\\\\) was altered during the evolution, due to the possibility of multiple thermal conductivity profiles leading to the same or similar temperature distributions at time \\\\(T\\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(k'\\\\) might produce indistinguishable outcomes in the transformed domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
