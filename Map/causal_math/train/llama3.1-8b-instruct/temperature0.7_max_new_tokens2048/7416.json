  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\( h(t) \\). We analyze the response of this system to a complex input signal \\( x(t) \\) using the Laplace transform, where the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is \\( X(s) \\) and that of \\( h(t) \\) is \\( H(s) \\).\n\nBased on the system output \\( y(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\), can we definitively decipher whether additional interventions, such as filtering with \\( g(t) \\), were applied post the initial input \\( x(t) \\), without independent knowledge of \\( g(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( y(t) \\) alone does not provide enough details to categorically determine whether or not interventions such as additional filtering occurred unless the characteristics of \\( g(t) \\) or its effect on the system are known. Multiple configurations of \\( x(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\), and \\( g(t) \\) might lead to the same output, making such inferences indistinct.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
