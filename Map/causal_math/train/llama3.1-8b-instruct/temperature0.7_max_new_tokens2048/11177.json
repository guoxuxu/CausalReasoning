  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), for some complex square matrix A. We evaluate the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also complex matrices.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Ce^{D0}z_0 = Cz_0 \\\\). Since \\\\( Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) is not generally equal to \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) unless C commutes with \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) for all T, the trajectory of the system changes leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
