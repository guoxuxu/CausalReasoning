  "Problem": "In a complex domain, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The time evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider alterations in this system's behavior by applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant.\n\nSuppose that at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by \\\\( H \\\\) and not by \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by all three constants \\\\( H \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and \\\\( N \\\\) due to the multiplicative effects of the exponential terms on the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\), influencing the system's entire path from start to finish.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
