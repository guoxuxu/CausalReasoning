  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function describes an oscillatory system in the complex plane. We examine the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system and its implications on the causal inference.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, does this affect the outcome of the Laplace transform at time T, when \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modifies the system to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t} \\\\). Therefore, the Laplace transform changes to \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ z(t) \\} (s) = \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i\\omega} \\\\). This new form is a direct consequence of the intervention, altering both the decay rate and the complex frequency component of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → ω; t → i; t → α; t1 → e^(-αt); e^(-αt) → Laplace transformation; Laplace transformation → z(t); z(t) → outcome of Laplace transform at time T; t1 → T"
