  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\). We explore the behavior of this transformation under different conditions and study the causal inference between the input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and its transformed counterpart \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is a zero function for all t, i.e., \\\\(f(t) = 0\\\\), will \\\\(F(s)\\\\) be zero for all s?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the zero function is always zero, as there are no values to transform across the integral from 0 to infinity. Therefore, \\\\(F(s)\\\\) will remain zero across all values of s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
