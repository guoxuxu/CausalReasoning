  "Problem": "Analyze a system given by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\), and consider the effect of applying a boundary condition transformation represented by \\\\( u = h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a harmonic function.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the exact boundary condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) that was used initially without knowing it beforehand?",
  "Explanation": "As the solution to the Laplace equation in domain \\\\( D \\\\) is uniquely determined by its boundary conditions and since the system is linear and time-invariant, knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) allows us to deduce \\\\( h(x) \\\\), assuming the solution everywhere inside \\\\( D \\\\) corresponds to that boundary condition uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
