  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention involving another transformation, say Fourier transform \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), is applied at some time during the evolution, will the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at the end still directly correspond to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without considering the effects of the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the Fourier transform as an intervention overlays additional spectral characteristics and modifications which are independent of the Laplace transform characteristics. Thus, these transformations collectively influence the final outcome, which won't align directly with the simple inverse of the original Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
