  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor of capacitance C, a resistor of resistance R, and a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t}. Using complex impedance for the circuit analysis, examine the effects of an intervention by introducing an inductor with inductance L midway through an observation period.\n\nIf the voltage source V(t) is set to a particular frequency \\\\omega, will the circuit's steady-state current response I(t) at time t = T be entirely determined by the R and C values when no inductor is added?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of the inductor, the circuit's impedance is solely determined by the resistor R and the capacitor C. The steady-state current response, I(t), at any frequency \\\\omega can be derived using the formula I(t) = \\\\frac{V(t)}{R + \\\\frac{1}{i \\\\omega C}}, indicating a direct dependence on R and C only.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
