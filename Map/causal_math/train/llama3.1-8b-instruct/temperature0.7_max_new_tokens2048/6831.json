  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system evolves over time t and undergoes an integral transform using the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervening function such as a damping effect, described by \\\\( u(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive real, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace Transform, will the transformed result \\\\( F(s) \\\\) still uniquely reflect the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any interference from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the damping function alters the form of the original function to \\\\( u(t)z(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}e^{i\\\\omega t} = e^{-(\\\\alpha-i\\\\omega)t} \\\\). The resultant Laplace Transform will thus be \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\), involving both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in its composition, affecting the clarity of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)'s inference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
