  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a function \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\) on a complex variable \\( z \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = kz \\), where \\( k \\) is a complex constant, and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), another function \\( j(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\) (where \\( \\theta \\) is another real number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( j(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) results in an additional rotational impact, making the final state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on the combined effects of \\( k \\), \\( \\omega \\), and \\( \\theta \\). The exponential components in \\( e^{i\\omega t_1} \\) and \\( e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)} \\) both influence the final state calculations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
