  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time under the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) for a matrix C.\n\nIf further interventions are made by applying another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z(t) \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still solely depend on the characteristics of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new modifying dynamic in the form of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). The output at T consequentially depends not only on the original matrices A and B but also significantly on C (from the earlier transformation) and D, due to their respective influences on the trajectory of z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
