  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop feedback system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) is the control input. We are examining the system's behavior under the integral transformation given by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(K+L)s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\).\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine which transformations (either \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both) were applied based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The specific transformations leading to a particular state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) are not uniquely decipherable from the final state alone because both transformations \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( S(x) \\\\) might result in overlapping or indistinguishable effects on the system’s trajectory, influenced by the nature of \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
