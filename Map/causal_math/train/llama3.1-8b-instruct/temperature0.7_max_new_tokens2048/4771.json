  "Problem": "Consider a stochastically driven system modeled by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + BX_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are deterministic matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Brownian motion. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(X) = C e^{Dt}X_t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and explore the system's evolution.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a transformation \\\\( h(X) = Fe^{Gt}X_t \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) are constant matrices) is conducted at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( X(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B, D, \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced transformation via \\\\( h(X) \\\\) adds new dynamics to the system represented by \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\). This, along with \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), influences the stochastic differential equation's pathway significantly, altering how \\\\( X(T) \\\\) evolves post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
