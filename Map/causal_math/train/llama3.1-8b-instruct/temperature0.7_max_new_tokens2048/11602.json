  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz + u \\\\) with \\\\( u \\\\) being a control function and \\\\( D \\\\) a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nKnowing the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing \\\\( u(t) \\\\)'s form?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\( u \\\\), which directly affects the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\), implies that multiple combinations of initial conditions and forms of \\\\( u \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Therefore, without explicit knowledge of \\\\( u(t) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely back-calculate the initial state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
