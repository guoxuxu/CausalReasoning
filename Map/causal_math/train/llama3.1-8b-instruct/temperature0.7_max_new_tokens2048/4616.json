  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). We investigate how modifying the original function impacts its Laplace transform, and vice versa, particularly focusing on an exponential function applied as \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we pinpoint what specific transformations (value of \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( g(t) \\\\)) were applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation observed as \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could result from numerous combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), impacting \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in different manners but leading to the same resultant transform. The lack of unique mapping from the final state \\\\( H(s) \\\\) back to specific parameters means that these cannot be uniquely determined without extra contextual information or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
