  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between complex functions and their integral transformations, specifically considering a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Does causal inference change with or without the presence of transformational modifications or interventions?\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 z(t) \\\\) is applied before performing the Laplace transform, will \\\\( L(g)(s) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) without requiring knowledge about the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) can be related to \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), the transformation involves convolution and integration manipulation that cannot be solely determined by \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\). It requires explicit knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the nature of the transformation (\\\\( t^2 \\\\)) applied to it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
