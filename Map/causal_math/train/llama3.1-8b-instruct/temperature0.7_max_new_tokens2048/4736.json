  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We are curious about the effect of modifying the function f by a polynomial \\\\( p(t) = t^2 \\\\) before applying the integral transformation.\n\nKnowing the resultant transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can one conclusively determine whether the intervention (addition of \\\\( c \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) occurred, based solely on the value of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will differ with an intervention, but such effects could be mathematically mimicked by other potential modifications to the function or even by variations in the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Thus, identifying the specific intervention from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone isn't feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
