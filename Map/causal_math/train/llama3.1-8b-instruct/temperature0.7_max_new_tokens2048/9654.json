  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} x \\\\) defining a rotation in the complex plane, where A is a real constant matrix and x is a complex vector. We investigate how time-dependent transformations \\\\( f(t, z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with B also a constant matrix, influence the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the evolution result \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine if the transforming function \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) was applied earlier without knowing B?",
  "Explanation": "Determining if the transformation \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) was applied without explicit knowledge of B is challenging. The matrix B could adjust the rotational dynamics in a way that isn't distinguishable from those induced by A at time T unless other specific identifiable effects of B are known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
