  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex domain. We assess the effect of applying a Laplace Transform, indicated by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to a transformed function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0 and is transformed by Laplace Transform over a period T without any intervention, will the Laplace Transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) reflect solely the characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( g(t) = e^{it} \\\\) directly analyses the function without intervention, directly reflecting the exponential decay and oscillatory nature inherent in \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\). The transformed function's characteristics in the s-domain directly represent \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
