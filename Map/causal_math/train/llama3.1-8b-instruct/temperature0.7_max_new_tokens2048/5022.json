  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear operator describing the system's inductance matrix. Analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\(\\phi(V) = e^{Mt}V\\), where \\(M\\) is another inductance matrix, on the voltage \\(V\\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf \\(V(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) is observed without knowledge of whether \\(\\phi(V)\\) was applied at \\(t=0\\), can the original vector \\(V_0\\) be accurately deduced?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\(\\phi(V)\\) was applied, it is unfeasible to accurately deduce \\(V_0\\) since the transformation \\(e^{Mt}\\) could have altered the original conditions in a manner that isn't traceable without specific knowledge of \\(M\\) and how it interacts with \\(L\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
