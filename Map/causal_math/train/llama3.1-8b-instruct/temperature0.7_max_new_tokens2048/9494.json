  "Problem": "In a control system, a linear time-invariant differential equation describes the system's dynamics: \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The effect of control input is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), where K is a control matrix applied at time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear information on whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, and what the matrix K was, we cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) since different K values could alter the initial conditions in a myriad of ways, leading to the same observed endpoint due to different trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
