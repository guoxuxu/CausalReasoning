  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by a set of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')\\\\, dt'\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nGiven the observed state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine exactly which, if any, transformations (i.e., \\\\(T(z)\\\\) or \\\\(S(z)\\\\)) were applied, solely by knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final complex function \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from a variety of sequences of transformations or a combination thereof due to the nature of the exponential operations in the transformations and their interactions. The merging of possible trajectories produced by different transformations makes it challenging to clearly identify what specific interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
