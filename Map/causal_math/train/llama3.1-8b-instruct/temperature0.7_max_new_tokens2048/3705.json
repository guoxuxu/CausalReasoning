  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) that is subjected to the operator \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Analyze scenarios where an additional transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) into \\\\( G(s) \\\\), and no other transformation is applied, will the resulting function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) account for possible quadratic modifications of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) due to \\\\( t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L \\\\) directly translates the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) into its Laplace form without altering its functional composition. The quadratic factor \\\\( t^2 \\\\) is not inherent to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and requires explicit application, thus it is not considered in \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\). ",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
