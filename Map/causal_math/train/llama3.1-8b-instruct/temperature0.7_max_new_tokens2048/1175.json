  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nIf an external modification \\\\( S(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (with C being another constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( S(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) dependent not only on A but also on B and C. The interaction of these exponential terms means that the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) is influenced by all three parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
