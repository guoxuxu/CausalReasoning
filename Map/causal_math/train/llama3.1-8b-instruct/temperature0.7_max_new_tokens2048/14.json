  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a space of functions. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by kernel \\( K(x, s) \\) and analyze both the direct application of \\( L \\) and the application after the transformation \\( K \\).\n\nGiven the output function \\( L(K \\ast f)(x) \\) at some point \\( x \\), can we deduce the original function \\( f \\) at that point without knowing whether \\( K \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( K \\), the output \\( L(K \\ast f)(x) \\) may lead to ambiguous interpretations about \\( f \\). The effect of the kernel could be essential in shaping the resultant function, making it difficult to reverse engineer to \\( f \\) without acknowledgment of its impact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the linear operator L after the transformation K reveals information about the original function f at point x."
