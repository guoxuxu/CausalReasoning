  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = C e^{At} \\\\), where A is a skew-symmetric matrix and C is a constant matrix. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transform given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is calculated for the initial function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and then the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} \\\\) is applied, will the resulting function at any time t be the same as the original function \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse should ideally be exact inverses, theoretically reconstructing the original function perfectly provided all conditions for convergence are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
