  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant voltage source V and a linear resistor R in series with a capacitor C. The charge Q on the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\\\frac{V - Q/C}{R}\\\\). We study the impact of applying a sinusoidal function \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) as an external forcing term to the circuit.\n\nIf we observe the charge \\\\(Q(t)\\\\) on the capacitor at t = T, knowing it differs from the expected behavior under the natural system, can we signify precisely that \\\\(f(t)\\\\) was the cause without any knowledge of its form or parameters?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple external forces could produce similar alterations in the capacitor's charge behavior. Without specific knowledge of the function's form or frequency, it is not possible to definitively attribute the observed \\\\(Q(t)\\\\) to the function \\\\(f(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The voltage source V and the resistor R directly influence the charge Q on the capacitor, while the capacitance C also affects the charge Q."
