  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we precisely determine the interventions used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) by only knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the additive nature of the phase shifts from \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\), multiple combinations of \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\) can lead to the same \\( z(T) \\). This makes it impossible to uniquely determine the sequence and specific interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
