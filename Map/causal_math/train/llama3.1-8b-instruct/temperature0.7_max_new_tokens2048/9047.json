  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{t^2} \\\\) at some time t_1 < T, will the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T rely exclusively on the original contour C, regardless of whether it was changed to C'?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function integrated along the contour, and different contours could yield different results due to differences in the exponential growth introduced by \\\\( e^{t^2} \\\\) and the way it interacts with the path-dependent integration over C or C'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
