  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations given by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We investigate the influence of a transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\), where M is another matrix and c is a constant vector, on the solution x.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is applied to a solution vector \\\\(x_0\\\\), and then this transformed vector is used to solve \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) match the original \\\\(x_0\\\\) used if no transformation had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\) alters the initial vector, changing the equation to \\\\(A(Mx + c) = b\\\\). Unless M is the identity matrix and c is the zero vector, the solution vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will generally be different from the original \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to the modification of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
