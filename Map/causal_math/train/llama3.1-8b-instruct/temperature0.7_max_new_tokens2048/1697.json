  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature T in a region evolves according to the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Suppose a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(T) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( T_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(T) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a sinusoidal term, which then evolves differently from \\\\( T_0 \\\\) under the heat equation. This sinusoidal perturbation will diffuse at a rate determined by \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and interact with the existing distribution, leading to a different distribution at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
