  "Problem": "Consider a closed loop feedback system where the output function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\\\) involving a Laplace transform variable 's'. We evaluate the introduction of a disturbance function \\\\( d(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real number, affecting the output.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time t, is it possible to conclusively trace back to determine whether the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) was introduced, without prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents a convolution with the disturbance, and without the specific value of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), it is impossible to disentangle the components contributed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone from those altered by \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), the spectral characteristics influenced by the disturbance can't be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
