  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nGiven the frequency domain representation \\\\( g(w) \\\\) after the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the time domain without any error?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the transformations were done correctly and all properties required for the Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms are satisfied, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can be precisely recovered from \\\\( g(w) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
