  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax^2 + Bx + C \\\\), where A, B, and C are constants. We explore the system's behavior with the initial condition \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\) and a transformation defined by \\\\( f(x) = Dxe^{Et} \\\\), where D and E are constants.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Kxe^{Lt} \\\\) (where K and L are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely impacted by the original constants A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an additional transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces further modifications to the trajectory. These changes, layered atop effects from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the dynamics governed by A, B, and C, mean the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by K and L as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
