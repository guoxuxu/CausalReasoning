  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) by a linear operator L, defined as \\\\(L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where A is a complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nGiven the final result after applying both L and M at different intervals, can we uniquely determine the sequence and parameters of the transformations (A and B) based solely on the final output?",
  "Explanation": "The final output resulting from applying both L and M could potentially be achieved by different sequences of these operators with varying parameters A and B. The overlapping effects of the exponential integrals and possible non-uniqueness in function responses under these transformations obscure the ability to backtrack precisely which operations were used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
