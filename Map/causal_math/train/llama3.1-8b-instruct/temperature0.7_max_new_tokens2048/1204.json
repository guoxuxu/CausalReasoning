  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the position of a particle, \\(s(t)\\), is influenced by a complex potential \\(U(z) = V(x) + iW(y)\\), where \\(z = x + iy\\). The movement is governed by the equation \\(\\dot{z}(t) = U'(z)\\). We assess the impact of linear transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) defined by the matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}\\), and their effect over time \\(t\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\(z(T)\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were used (whether \\(\\mathbf{T}\\), \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\(z(T)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\(z(T)\\) could result from various combinations of transformations and their timings due to the complex derivative \\(U'(z)\\) influencing the dynamically evolving state in a potentially nonlinear manner. Identifying the precise sequence or type of interventions without additional data is not feasible due to overlapping and interdependent possible effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
