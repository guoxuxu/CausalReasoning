  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\\\lambda y \\\\), with boundary conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(1) = 0 \\\\). Here, \\\\( q(x) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how transformations \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) (where k is a constant multiplier) affect the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) is applied to an eigenfunction \\\\( y_0(x) \\\\) of the original Sturm-Liouville problem, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\\\lambda y \\\\) without any further action, does the resulting function qualify as an eigenfunction of the untransformed problem?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of an eigenfunction \\\\( y_0(x) \\\\) by a constant k does not change its property of being an eigenfunction for the original differential operator since the operator is linear and homogeneous. Hence, \\\\( f(y_0) = ky_0 \\\\) satisfies the original Sturm-Liouville problem for the same \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
