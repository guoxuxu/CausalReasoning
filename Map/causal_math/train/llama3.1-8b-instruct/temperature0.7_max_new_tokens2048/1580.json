  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\) where c is a complex number. We analyze the impact of integral transformations using the Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). Let's examine the transformations with and without interventions on the function and its reverse causality.\n\nCan we precisely resolve the original values of c and t if given the Laplace Transform output after an intervention that shifted t by a known u?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the intervention (shifting by u), the Laplace Transform output doesn't necessarily allow for a unique reversal to both c and the original t. The transformation affects the output in a manner where multiple combinations of c and t could result in the same transformed function, hence making precise determination infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
