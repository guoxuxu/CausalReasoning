  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T, x)) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether none, \\\\( M \\\\), or another operator), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T, x)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different operators could yield the same final transformed state due to the properties of linear operators and transformations in differential equations. The lack of uniqueness in potential operator effects prevents the exact determination of which interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
