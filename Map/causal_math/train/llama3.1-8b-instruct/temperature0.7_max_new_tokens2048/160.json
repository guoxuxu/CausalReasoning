  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on a matrices, \\\\( g(Z) = e^{Z} \\\\), applied to the solution \\\\( X(t) \\\\) of a differential system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = MX + XN \\\\) where M and N are constant matrices. We explore the effects and causation in different scenarios involving this transformation.\n\nGiven the state observed at \\\\( g(X(T)) \\\\), can we precisely determine the intermediary interventions (application of \\\\( h \\\\) or any other function), if any were used?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specifically which interventions, like \\\\( h(Z) = Z^2 \\\\), were applied during the evolution of \\\\( X \\\\) is complex due to the non-linear transformations and the possibility of multiple interventions leading to similar resulting states. This ambiguity arises because of the diverse effects these functions can have on the matrix evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
