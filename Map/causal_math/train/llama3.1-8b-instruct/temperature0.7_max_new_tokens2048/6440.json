  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\), \\\\( g(T) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( T(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or types of interventions, due to the variable nature and overlapping effects of additional heat \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and cooling \\\\( k(x,t) \\\\) functions. These additive and subtractive transformations complicate exact backward determination of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
