  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential V(x), described by \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = [-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 + V(x)]\\\\psi \\\\). We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) at time t and analyzing its momentum space representation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the wave function is allowed to evolve according to the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\psi(p, T) \\\\) in momentum space at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) was evolved to t = T and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolving in position space yields a different trajectory due to the potential term V(x) affecting the phase differently in position space before transforming, compared to evolving in momentum space directly where the kinetic and potential energy contributions evolve differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
