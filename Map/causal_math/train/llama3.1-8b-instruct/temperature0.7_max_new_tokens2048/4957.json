  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a two-dimensional domain, and a transformation \\\\( u(x, y) = v(x, y) + g(x, y) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) is a harmonic function (also satisfying the Laplace equation).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) at initial boundary conditions, and allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at a later time be the same as if \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) was subjected directly to the same boundary conditions under \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 v = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) satisfies the Laplace equation and is harmonic, the transformation does not alter the behavior of \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\). The superposition principle for linear equations like the Laplace equation indicates that \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) will satisfy the equation individually regardless of initial conditions, as \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) merely shifts but maintains the laplacian zero condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
