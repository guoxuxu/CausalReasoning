  "Problem": "Analyze a controlled system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{t} + cu_{x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. A transformation is considered, defined by \\\\( g(u) = U(x,t) \\\\) where U is an integrating factor related to u, potentially altering the system dynamics.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), can we accurately retrieve the original function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied, recovering the precise initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) would be doubtful. The transformation could significantly modify initial conditions, complicating any direct inversion especially without additional information or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
