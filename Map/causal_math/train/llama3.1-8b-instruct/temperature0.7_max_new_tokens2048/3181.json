  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a dynamically determined matrix. The system is subjected to operators \\( h(x) = Ce^{Ft}x \\) and \\( k(x) = Ke^{Gt}x \\) representing two types of interventions over time t with constant matrices C, F, K, and G.\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to a state \\( x_0 \\) at time t = 0, and the system then evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) without further intervention, will the state \\( x(T) \\) at time T be equivalent to the state derived from directly evolving \\( x_0 \\) under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\( h(x) = Ce^{Ft}x_0 \\) at t = 0 alters the initial conditions by transforming \\( x_0 \\) which modifies the trajectory of the initial state. Unless F commutes with D, the result will not simply be the trajectory evolution of \\( x_0 \\) under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), but will instead reflect the compounded influence of C, F in terms of growth patterns and directions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
