  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis setting where a complex function \\\\(z(s) = e^{sZ}\\\\) transforms a variable \\\\(s\\\\), and \\\\(Z\\\\) is a complex matrix. The system then undergoes an integral transformation via the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\) post-intervention, can we conclusively determine the specific type and parameters (i.e., matrix \\\\(Z\\\\) or \\\\(W\\\\)) of transformations that were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant function of the Laplace transform is a comprehensive effect of all changes, including the dynamic alterations by \\\\(Z\\\\) and \\\\(W\\\\). Without distinct identifiers within the resulting function that clearly separate the influences of \\\\(Z\\\\) and \\\\(W\\\\), it's not feasible to conclusively discern the parameters or types of transformations applied based solely on the Laplace transform outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
