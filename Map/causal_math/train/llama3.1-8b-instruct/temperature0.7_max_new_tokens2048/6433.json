  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nWould the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolving it under the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any further changes result in the same endpoint as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) alters the initial state, and thus modifies how the state evolves. Given that C influences the growth or decay of the real and imaginary components differently than A and B alone, the final state will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
