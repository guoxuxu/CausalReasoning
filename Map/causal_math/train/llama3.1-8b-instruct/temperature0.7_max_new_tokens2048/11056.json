  "Problem": "We consider a complex function transformation in the context of an integral transformation. The initial function is \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original real-valued function. We analyze applying a transformation \\\\( h(t) = k(t) * f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( * \\\\) denotes convolution with a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the ultimate transformed function \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we precisely pinpoint which transformations or convolutions were applied (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( j(t) \\\\), both, or none), solely based on the evaluation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at the endpoint can result from varying convolution combinations and sequences, greatly complicating the inversion process. Without additional knowledge, distinguishing between sequences or types of interventions based solely on the final transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is theoretically infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
