  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) is then computed, will the transformed function's behavior in the Fourier space represent the same differential property as applying the Fourier transform first and then computing its differential effect?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then taking the Fourier transform converts the double differentiation in real space into a multiplication in the Fourier space by \\\\( -k^2 \\\\), which is equivalent to first transforming \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and then applying the differential operation in the Fourier space.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
