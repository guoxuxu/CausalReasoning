  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( A \\) is a real matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\( T(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), applied to \\( z(t) \\) at different time points \\( t \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nDoes the function \\( z(t) \\) evaluated at a specific time \\( t = T \\) remain invariant under the application of the transformation \\( T \\) without further manipulation of the function or additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transform \\( T \\) to \\( z(t) \\) would actually compute a complex Laplace transform involving \\( e^{iAt} \\), which significantly alters the function by integrating it over all time with the exponential decay factor \\( e^{-st} \\). The output fundamentally differs from merely evaluating \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
