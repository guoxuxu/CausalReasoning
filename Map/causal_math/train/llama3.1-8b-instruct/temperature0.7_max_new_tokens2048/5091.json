  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is actively applied, influencing the system, will the transformed initial state under \\\\( f(x) \\\\) still solely determine the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T introduces a new variable impacting the system's evolution, regardless of the initial transformation by C. The system's state at any time T > t_1 is a result of the combined effects of initial transformation, the system dynamics A, and the control effect introduced by B and u(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
