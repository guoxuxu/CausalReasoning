  "Problem": "We consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\), with M being a complex matrix. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge about the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) leads to ambiguity since the transformation \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) could modify \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in an unknown way. The non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials with respect to M further complicates reversing the trajectory back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
