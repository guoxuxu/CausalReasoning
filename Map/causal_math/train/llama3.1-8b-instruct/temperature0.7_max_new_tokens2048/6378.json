  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(z(s)\\) defined over the complex plane and involving a parameter \\(s = x + yi\\) (where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit). We are particularly interested in investigating how the transformation \\(H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\\) (a Laplace transform) behaves with changes in the function \\(f(t)\\) used in the transform.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\(H(s)\\), can we directly deduce the form of \\(f(t)\\) if no additional information about \\(g(t)\\) or their respective transforms is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific data about \\(g(t)\\) or knowledge that \\(f(t)\\) was modified, it's impossible to uniquely reverse engineer \\(f(t)\\) from \\(H(s)\\) since multiple combinations of \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) might result in the same \\(H(s)\\), especially considering the integration over \\(t\\) and interaction with \\(s\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
