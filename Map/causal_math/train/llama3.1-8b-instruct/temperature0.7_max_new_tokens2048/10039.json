  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions and their derivatives are effected by the Laplace Transform. Here, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ v(t) \\\\} = V(s) \\\\), with s representing the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) + w(t) \\\\) where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is another real function and its Laplace Transform is known, will the resultant function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still reflect only the original U(s) without influence from W(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) introduces an additional component that modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\), and consequently, the resultant transformed function U'(s) will be a combination of U(s) and W(s). This makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on W(s) as well as U(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
