  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of this transformation in the context of the Laplace transform, defined as \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) is applied to transform a real variable input \\( t \\) into the complex plane, and then the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) is calculated, will \\( F(s) \\) be the same as the Laplace transform of the original function without the \\( e^{iz} \\) transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) introduces an oscillatory exponential factor, significantly altering the behavior of the function in the complex plane, thus changing the result of the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\). The transform of \\( e^{iz} \\) results in complex exponentials which behave differently under integration in the Laplace domain compared to the original real function \\( t \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → e^(iz); e^(iz) → F(s); F(s) → s; t → z; e^(iz) → F(s) → F(s) being the same as the Laplace transform of the original function; t → Laplace transform of the original function"
