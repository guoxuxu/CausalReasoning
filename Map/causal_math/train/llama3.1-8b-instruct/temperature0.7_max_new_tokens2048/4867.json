  "Problem": "We examine the effect of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. This transformation represents a rotation in the complex plane. Subsequently, the transformed complex number is used in a Fourier transform calculation \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is some integrable function.\n\nIf a further transformation, say \\\\( z'(w) = e^{-i\\\\phi}w \\\\) with a different angle \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), is applied midway through the Fourier transform operation over time, will the resulting output depend uniquely on either \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform output will incorporate the effects of both transformations resulting from multiplying rotational factors, leading to a final effective rotation that is a result of both \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\). Thus, the output is a function of the combined transformations, not either one individually.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
