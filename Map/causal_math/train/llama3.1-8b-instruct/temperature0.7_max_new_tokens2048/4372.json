  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. Assume that the system's behavior is influenced by a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = L[z(t)] = L[u(t)] + iL[v(t)] \\\\), with s being the complex frequency.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Laplace transformation, the filtering operation, or both) based solely on the value of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain could potentially result from different combinations of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s behavior and interventions (either the initial Laplace transform or subsequent filtering). The transformations and their effects might not uniquely indicate which interventions were applied due to possible overlaps in the resultant spectral behaviors in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
