  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nBased on the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some final time T, can we identify exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) during the time period till T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modify the state in a manner dependent on the continuous and potentially overlapping parameterization by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Consequently, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) could yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine the specific transformations used without additional information on the sequence or timing of applications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
