  "Problem": "In a control system, the effect of a matrix operator \\\\( P \\\\) on a signal's Fourier transform is examined. Given a signal function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), its Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is denoted by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The operator \\\\( P \\\\) acts on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) to produce \\\\( P(X(\\\\omega)) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf, during the processing of \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) through \\\\( G(s) \\\\), an intervening operator \\\\( Q = \\\\frac{1}{s + 2\\\\omega^2} \\\\) is introduced at some point, will the final output signal still directly reflect only the effect of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and not \\\\( P \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( Q \\\\) modifies the outcome, introducing an effect dependent on its form and not merely on \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The final output becomes altered by the interaction between \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( Q \\\\), leading to a composite effect rather than attributing effects solely to \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
