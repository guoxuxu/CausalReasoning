  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region \\\\(R\\\\). We study the behavior under a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and analyze the system's response over a boundary \\\\(S\\\\) conditional on a function \\\\(v = e^{kt} u\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original boundary values \\\\( u(S) \\\\) from observing the transformed values \\\\( F(u)(S) \\\\) without knowing the specific content of Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, while invertible, requires knowledge of its complete application, including transformation pairs and frequency components. Without this specific information, reconstructing the original \\\\(u(S)\\\\) from \\\\(F(u)(S)\\\\) may not be accurate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
