  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real constant matrix and z a complex number. We study the behavior of this function when subject to transformations and analyze the inverse Laplace transformation which is given by \\\\( F(p) = L^{-1} \\\\{ f(z) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf an adjustment by a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCz} \\\\) (where C is a real constant matrix) is applied at a specific point and then the inverse Laplace transformation is applied, will the resulting function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) be different from the case with no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a point modifies the function from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to a new composite function involving both A and C, altering the original dynamics. The Laplace transformation of this new function, considering the effects of both exponentials, will inherently differ from that without \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
