  "Problem": "Let's consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time in the complex plane. We investigate the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf a function \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state at time \\\\( T \\\\) (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend only on the original transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\) further modifies the dynamics initiated by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). The system's behavior, therefore, becomes a result of both transformations, leading to \\\\( z(T) = (e^{it_1})^6 \\\\cdot e^{i(T-t_1)} \\\\) if applied in sequence. Hence, the endpoint depends on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
