  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}x d\\\\tau \\), where C is another constant matrix over time t.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied or not, can we determine the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) used at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), and given the potential change introduced by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) in the integral, it is not feasible to uniquely backtrack the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to the non-reversibility and potential overlapping of state trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
