  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace Transform of this function is used to analyze its behavior in the complex frequency domain, represented as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some point s, can we uniquely determine the original functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without knowing if any modifications were applied pre-transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a complex function like \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is typically unique to its time-domain representation, but without additional information about modifications like constant shifts, there can be ambiguity between multiple potential originating functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
