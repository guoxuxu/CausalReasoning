  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagating in a medium characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the wave function, \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(x\\\\) is spatial coordinate, and \\\\(c\\\\) is wave speed. Let's investigate the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at an initial time, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), it is challenging to reverse-engineer the exact state of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The transformation adds spectral components that could lead to multiple potential initial conditions that fit the observed state at T, given the non-uniqueness linked to the periodic and oscillatory nature of the wave equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
