  "Problem": "Analyze the input-output relationship in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by the system function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. Evaluate the impact of applying a Laplace transform, which translates the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain operation.\n\nIf an additional filtering operation represented by another LTI system \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+c} \\\\) is applied to the output at a certain time, will the final system output in the Laplace domain be straightforwardly expected as the product of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( G(s) \\\\), and the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, when consecutive LTI systems are involved, the overall system function becomes the product of individual system functions. Therefore, the final output's Laplace transform is the product of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( G(s) \\\\), and the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), assuming input remains unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
