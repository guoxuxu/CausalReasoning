  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) representing a controlled input.\n\nGiven the output at time \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the precise input function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) used from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple input functions can result in the same output at time \\\\( T \\\\) due to the properties of convolution and the potential non-invertibility of the transformation. Information about the entire response function or additional conditions would be needed to uniquely determine \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
