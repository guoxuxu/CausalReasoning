  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the input function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) + d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) at t = 0, and the system evolves naturally without further intervention, will the transformed output \\\\( w'(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was directly processed to generate \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X?",
  "Explanation": "The modification in \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by adding a constant \\\\( d \\\\) will lead to a corresponding change in the integral computation of \\\\( v(x) \\\\), shifting it by \\\\( d \\\\) times the integral of the kernel over t, and thus \\\\( w'(x) \\\\) will also be shifted by the same amount, differing from the original \\\\( w(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
