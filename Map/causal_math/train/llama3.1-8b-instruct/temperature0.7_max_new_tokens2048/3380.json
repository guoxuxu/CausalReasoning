  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent real function and \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the influence of this transformation where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function having both amplitude modulation and phase shift properties based on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain what interventions (the initial transformation using \\\\( w \\\\) or the scaling using \\\\( k \\\\)) and in what order they were applied by just knowing the formula of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be the outcome of various interplays between the initial complex exponential transformation and the scaling intervention, with non-unique sequences giving rise to the same final form. The layering of effects from \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) contributes to multiple possible histories that cannot be disentangled solely based on the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
