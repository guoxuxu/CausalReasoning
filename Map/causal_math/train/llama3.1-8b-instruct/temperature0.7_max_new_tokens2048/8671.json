  "Problem": "Investigate the system described by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant. We apply transformations using the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and study the effect at time \\( t \\).\n\nIf a transformation \\( G(s) \\) is applied at a mid-point \\( t_1 \\) before reaching \\( T \\) (where \\( G(s) \\) is another Laplace transform function), will the system's state \\( z(T) \\) depend only on \\( e^{at} \\) and not on \\( F(s) \\) or \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( G(s) \\) plus the initial transformation \\( F(s) \\) affects the trajectory in the s-domain. These transformations will shape the state at \\( T \\) extensively, meaning \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( e^{at} \\), \\( F(s) \\), and \\( G(s) \\). Their effects are compounded in the s-domain dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
