  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is then transformed using a Fourier Transform to analyze its frequency components over time.\n\nDoes the frequency component of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remain unchanged in its Fourier Transform representation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This shows that the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is preserved exactly in the transformation, with no change or loss in the frequency content.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → ω; ω → z(t); t → z(t); ω → Fourier Transform; Fourier Transform → frequency component; z(t) → Fourier Transform; t → Fourier Transform"
