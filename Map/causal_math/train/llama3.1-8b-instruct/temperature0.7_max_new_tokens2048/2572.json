  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation denoted by \\\\( h(z) = Pe^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where P is a constant matrix and Q is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at endpoint T, can we determine precisely what transformations and interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( i(z) \\\\), or both) by analyzing just \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity introduced by several matrix exponentials and their potential non-commutative interactions makes it incredibly challenging to deduce the exact sequence or type of interventions, such as \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( i \\\\), applied during the evolution. Multiple different transformation paths may yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
