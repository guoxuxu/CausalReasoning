  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(z_0(t) = e^{it}\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at a later time T be the same as if \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\), involving an integration over time with an evolving exponential factor \\\\(e^{s^2}\\\\), modifies the trajectory of the function, altering the original dynamics described by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\). Consequently, the state of the system at time T after applying \\\\(T(z)\\\\) will not match that obtained from direct evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
