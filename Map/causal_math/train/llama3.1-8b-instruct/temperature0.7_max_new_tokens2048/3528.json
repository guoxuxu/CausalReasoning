  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + u_{xx} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u_t\\\\) and \\\\(u_{xx}\\\\) are the time and second space derivatives of \\\\(u\\\\), respectively. To study the problem, we use the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x,t)dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (either initial Fourier transformed state or modifications at \\\\(t_1\\\\)) were used, calculated only by knowing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformations and potential interventions affecting the spatial and modal compositions, the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) could result from various initial and modified states, making it impossible to determine uniquely the specific interventions or initial conditions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
