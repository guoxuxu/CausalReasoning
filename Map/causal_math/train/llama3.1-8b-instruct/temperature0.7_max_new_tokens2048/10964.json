  "Problem": "Assess the causal relationship in a vector field defined by \\\\( z(x, t) = Ax + tBx \\\\) where A and B are fixed matrices and x is an input vector. An integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{sC}z(x, s) ds \\\\) is applied to z(x, t), involving a matrix C.\n\nKnowing the final outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\), is it possible to determine whether the intervention \\\\( G(z) \\\\) was applied, based solely on the end result?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in potential effects from A, B, C, and D, especially considering their interactions through both integration and matrix exponentiations makes it unfeasible to definitively identify the use of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The transformations can yield similar results for different matrix configurations and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
