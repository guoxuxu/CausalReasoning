  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were employed (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely from the final state value?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the interventions from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is not feasible, as different combinations of transformations and their timings (\\\\( R \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\) and their application times) can produce equivalent outcomes. The overlap in potential effects and trajectories introduced by the exponentials makes precise identification of historical interventions impossible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
