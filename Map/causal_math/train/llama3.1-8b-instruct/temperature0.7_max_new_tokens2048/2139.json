  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the properties of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f](s) \\\\) of this function, given for a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\tilde{f}(z) = e^{(z+p)^2} \\\\) for some complex constant \\\\( p \\\\), and we compute \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[\\\\tilde{f}](s) \\\\), will the result depend solely on the properties of \\\\( s \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\tilde{f}(z) = e^{(z+p)^2} \\\\), introduces a dependency on the original form of \\\\( f \\\\) since the transformed function is directly derived by modifying the original. Thus, the outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\tilde{f} \\\\) is not independent of the initial definition of \\\\( f \\\\) but also reflects the changes introduced by the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
