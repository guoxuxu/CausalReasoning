  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) which represents the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) applicable over the domain of complex numbers for \\\\( z \\\\). The system's behavior is analyzed by varying the complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) and examining the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2u(z) \\\\).\n\nIf the function parameter \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( u(z) \\\\) is squared without any external intervention, will this change the result of the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) when compared to just applying \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( u(z) \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "Squaring \\\\( z \\\\) directly affects the Laplace transform's convergence and alters the domain of definition. Since \\\\( g(z) = z^2u(z) \\\\), manipulating \\\\( z \\\\) before applying it will change the resultant transform reflecting the magnified response in the frequency domain differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
