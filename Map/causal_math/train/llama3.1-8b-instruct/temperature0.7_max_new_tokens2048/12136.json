  "Problem": "Consider an integral operation on the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) within the contour integral along a closed curve \\\\( C \\\\. The transformation to be applied is \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) before executing the integral.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and then we compute the contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{iz} z^2 dz \\\\) without further intervention, will this integral have the same value as the original \\\\( \\\\int_C z^2 dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) significantly alters the integrand, changing the function's structure that affects the outcome of the contour integral. The exponential multiple of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) introduces oscillatory behavior which will yield a different result from directly integrating \\\\( z^2 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
