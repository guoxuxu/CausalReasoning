  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. An integral transformation is applied, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under the differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) evolved directly to t = T under its respective differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions due to the integration and potential influence of the matrix C, which can alter the behavior of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). This results in a different trajectory and endpoint for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
