  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the use of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iSt} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where S is a complex constant, to modify z(t).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the initial differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial function by integrating it with a factor of \\\\( e^{iSt} \\\\). This change in initial conditions affects subsequent evolution, leading to a different state at time T due to the convolution-like effect of the integral transformation on both x(t) and y(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
