  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency in a physical context. The function is then transformed through an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine exactly the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) based only on the final result after applying both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and then \\\\( R \\\\), knowing the value at some \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "After successive transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\), the final result encapsulates highly mixed and integrated effects of both transformations. Without specific knowledge about the properties and interaction of these transformations, it's impossible to uniquely trace back to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
