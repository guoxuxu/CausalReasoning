  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nKnowing only \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\), is it feasible to precisely determine both the scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the shift vector \\\\( v \\\\) that were applied to the original function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the components of \\\\( v \\\\) from \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) is challenging as changes in scale can, to some extent, mimic or obscure the effects of shifting in the frequency domain, leading to potential ambiguities in identifying exact values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
