  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\), where M is a constant 2x2 matrix. Explore the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the system, where the Laplace transform of a vector function is applied component-wise.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(0)\\\\) as it was prior to any transformations with certainty?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system evolves from the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\) and the transformation is linear and time-invariant, knowing \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\) and the system matrix M allows for uniquely determining \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(0)\\\\) through the mathematical inversion process of the solving the system's differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
