  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the Laplace equation in a rectangular domain, governed by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\). We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions of the domain. Let the boundary conditions change from function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(h(x, y) = g(x, y) + e^{kx}\\\\), where `k` is a constant.\n\nIf a Laplace correction term is applied to the domain as an intervention at a specific time, which attempts to negate the effects of \\\\(e^{kx}\\\\), will the result inside the domain return to what would have been if only \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) were applied as boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "An appropriate intervention designed to cancel out the effect of \\\\(e^{kx}\\\\) on the boundary can recalibrate the boundary condition towards the original function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\). Assuming the intervention perfectly counteracts the added term, the resulting internal solution should revert to what would be observed under the original conditions dictated by \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\), based on the linearity and superposition principle in the Laplace equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
