  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the displacement vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time t is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by the function \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), on the system behavior.\n\nGiven the processed output \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( F(x) \\\\), \\\\( G(x) \\\\), or both), just by observing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used is not directly feasible from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone due to the overlapping effects of different transformation methods on the system's behavior, leading to indistinguishable final states under various transformation scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
