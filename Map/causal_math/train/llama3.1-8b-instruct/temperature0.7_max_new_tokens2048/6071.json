  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor R, inductor L, and capacitor C in series, governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). The interaction is studied using the Laplace Transform to switch between the time domain and the frequency domain.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) a constant voltage source is suddenly applied across the series circuit as an intervention, will the new steady-state solution in the frequency domain only depend on the characteristics equation of the original circuit elements?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a constant voltage source at \\\\(t_1\\\\) alters the source terms in the differential and hence the Laplace Transform of the equation. The steady-state solution in the frequency domain then incorporates the effects of the voltage source in addition to the natural response dictated by R, L, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
