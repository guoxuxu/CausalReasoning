  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or any other transformation) were used, solely by analyzing \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of numerous possible transformations that could adjust the dynamics of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) (like varying \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or multiple compounding operations) means the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) might result from different interventions. The ambiguity in the exponential influence without additional information on the evolution history or the nature of interventions makes accurate backtracking of interventions challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
