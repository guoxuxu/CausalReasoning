  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a series of transformations including a Fourier Transform followed by a linear filter represented by a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then an inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nCan the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) be perfectly reconstructed just by knowing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) if \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is known and assuming \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is invertible?",
  "Explanation": "Given the invertibility of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) can be reconstructed. The manipulation through \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is reversible by applying the inverse operation in the frequency domain, thus precisely retrieving the pre-transformed signal without any ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
