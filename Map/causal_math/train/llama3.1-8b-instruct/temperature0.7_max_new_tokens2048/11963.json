  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) where S is a constant matrix. The impact of the complex function \\\\( h(x) = e^{iDt}x \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone isn't feasible due to the potential overlapping effects and non-commutativity of the matrix exponentials. Various combinations of D, F, and their interaction with S can yield the same endpoint, leading to ambiguity in determining exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T → x(T); S → x(T); D → x(T); x → h(x); D → h(x); T → h(x); h(x) → x(T); x(T) → used intervention; x(T) → used intervention"
