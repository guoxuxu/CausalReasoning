  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda+i\\omega)t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) are real constants representing growth and oscillation parameters respectively. We will explore the impacts of applying a Laplace transform to this function and its inverse.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\gamma t}\\\\), with \\\\(\\gamma > 0\\\\) as a constant, is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the form of \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) derived from the modified function still be a simple transformation of \\\\(s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the damping factor modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(e^{(\\lambda-\\gamma+i\\omega)t}\\\\). This results in a new Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda - \\gamma + i\\omega)}\\\\), which has distinctly different real and imaginary parts compared to the original, showing explicit dependency on \\\\(\\gamma\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
