  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent functions defined in a physical system. The causal inference is analyzed through the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), where complex frequency s incorporates both decay and oscillatory behaviors.\n\nIs it feasible to deduce both the initial transformation and the mid-course intervention just by analyzing the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations overlap in their effects, merging into a combined influence on the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This fusion of effects, especially compounded over time in the frequency domain, makes it extremely challenging to separate and uniquely identify the contributions from each transformation retrospectively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
