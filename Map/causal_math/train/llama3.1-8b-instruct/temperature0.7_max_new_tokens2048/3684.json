  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and defined as \\\\( L[f(x)] = x^2f(x) \\\\). We investigate the properties of its responses under different transformation scenarios using the Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(x)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the modified transformation result \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can the exact sequence and type of interventions (applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\) or their combination) be identified from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final result \\\\( F(s) \\\\), being a transformation in the s-domain, could potentially stem from multiple configurations of the original function and interventions. Due to the properties of Laplace Transform and the non-linearity introduced by \\\\( L \\\\) and interaction with \\\\( g(x) \\\\), it's not feasible to precisely backtrack and identify the interventions from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
