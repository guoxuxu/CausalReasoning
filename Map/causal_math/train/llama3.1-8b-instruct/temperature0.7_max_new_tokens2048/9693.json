  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and transformed back without any modifications, will the resultant function over time \\\\( t \\\\) be exactly the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to reconstruct the original function if there are no alterations during the process. Hence, assuming no intervention and proper conditions (\\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\) being maintained), the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be exactly retrieved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
