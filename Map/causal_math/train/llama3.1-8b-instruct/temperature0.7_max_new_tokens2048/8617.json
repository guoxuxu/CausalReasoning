  "Problem": "Consider a function z defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are interested in how the Fourier Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), affects this function.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is taken at time t = 0, and then z(t) naturally evolves according to its definition without further mathematical intervention, does the resulting function at time T match the Fourier Transform of z(t) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( w \\\\). Because this transformation uniquely corresponds to the frequency domain representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and does not depend on time t, evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still results in the same transformed function. Thus, the Fourier Transform of the evolved function matches the initial transform.",
