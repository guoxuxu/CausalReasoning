  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on a linear algebra operation where \\\\( z \\\\) is mapped under \\\\( A \\\\), a square matrix. The transformation is given by the matrix exponential \\\\( h(A) = e^{A} \\\\). We explore how these transformations interact and evolve over time.\n\nGiven only the final state of the system, can we determine precisely whether an intervention occurred at \\\\( t \\\\) with either \\\\( p(B) \\\\) or a different matrix \\\\( C \\\\), knowing that both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are potential intervention matrices?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final matrix, due to the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentiation, combined with potential similarities in how \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) might affect the system, it's impossible to definitively tell which of the potential interventions was applied. The transformations may result in overlapping or indistinguishable end states because of their exponential behaviors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
