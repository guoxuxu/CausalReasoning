  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tx} dt \\\\), and we wish to analyze how transformations influence the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) through various manipulations, involving either differentiation under the integral sign or Laplace Transform.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where T is a specific value, can we infer the transformation parameter \\\\( a \\\\) without being aware of the application of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate whether a scaling by \\\\( a \\\\) was applied, as different transformations or different values of \\\\( a \\\\) could potentially result in the same outcome depending on the location and value of T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
