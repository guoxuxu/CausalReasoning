  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical study of electrical circuits where the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through a component is influenced by the Laplace transform applied to a time-dependent voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\). The system's differential equation is given by \\\\( I'(t) = L{V(t)} + RI(t) \\\\), with R being the resistance.\n\nGiven the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify the interventions applied (initial or inverse Laplace transforms, or both) based merely on the value of \\\\( I(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions like applying or reversing Laplace transforms based solely on the outcome \\\\( I(T) \\\\) is challenging due to potential overlaps in effects caused by the transformations and inherent dynamics of the system. Multiple combinations of interventions could lead to similar results at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
