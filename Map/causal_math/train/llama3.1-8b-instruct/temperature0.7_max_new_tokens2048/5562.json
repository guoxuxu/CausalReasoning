  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore how the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}f(z) \\\\, dt \\\\) affects causal inference.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and assuming no intervention apart from the initial application of \\\\( T[f] \\\\), can we determine the exact initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation applied through \\\\( T[f] \\\\), and only given the final state, there can be multiple potential initial states \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to the squaring operation which could yield the same outcome under the differential operation \\\\( M \\\\) and integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
