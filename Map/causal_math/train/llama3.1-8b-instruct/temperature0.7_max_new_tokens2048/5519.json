  "Problem": "Analyze a system modeled by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) the initial condition. We consider the impact of applying a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{Bt}x_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by convolution with another function \\\\( j(t) = e^{Ct}x_2 \\\\) is introduced, will the behavior of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the dynamics defined by \\\\( A \\\\) and not on interactions with \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics. The entire state of the system post \\\\( t_1 \\\\) becomes dependent not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but also crucially affected by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The resultant system's state integrates effects from all contributing exponential matrices and initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
