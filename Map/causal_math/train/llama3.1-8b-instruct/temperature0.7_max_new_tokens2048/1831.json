  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix providing a linear transformation.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Nx \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only rely on the matrix D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) further modifies the trajectory, thus the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on D, M, and N. Specifically, it depends on how these matrices interact and the exact timings of their application, covering \\\\( e^{D(T-t_1)}Ne^{Dt_1}Mx_0 \\\\) as the potential final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
