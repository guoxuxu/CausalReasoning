  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied on the initial condition vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. The interaction is studied under different transformations by incorporating another matrix function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be exactly reconstructed from observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T, without any information about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial intervention by \\\\( h(x) \\\\), any transformations caused by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions in ways that are not reversible uniquely. This uncertainty, compounded by the action of M, precludes an exact derivation of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
