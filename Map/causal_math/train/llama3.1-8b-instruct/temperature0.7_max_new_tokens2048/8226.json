  "Problem": "Investigate the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are complex constant matrices, considering the integral transformations over a time interval [0, T].\n\nObserving \\\\( w(T) \\\\) after it has evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the subsequent applications of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation through B was applied before A?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant vector \\\\( w(T) \\\\) incorporates transformations influenced by both A and B. Without clarity on whether and how B was applied before A, the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the final observed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
