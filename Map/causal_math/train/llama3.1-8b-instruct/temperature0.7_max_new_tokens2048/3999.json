  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by the Laplace operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s)\\\\), examining the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and its transformation \\\\\\\\(( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\)). We then intervene by applying a transformation through the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{t}f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{t}f(t) \\\\) is applied midway at \\\\( t = T/2 \\\\), will the final transformed function in the Laplace domain depend solely on the initial Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( g(t) = e^{t}f(t) \\\\) changes the nature of the function before applying the Laplace transform. This change affects the resulting Laplace domain representation, making it a function of both \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and the new parameters introduced by multiplying with \\\\( e^{t} \\\\). The final transform will therefore depend on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
