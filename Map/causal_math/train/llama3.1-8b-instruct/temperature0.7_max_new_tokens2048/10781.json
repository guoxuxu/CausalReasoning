  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. Let \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) be the velocity field, and suppose a transformation by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a stream function representing a perturbation.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) into the initial condition \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equations without further intervention, will the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without the introduction of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the perturbation through \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) modifies the initial conditions and hence, influences the evolution of the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\). Depending on the nature of \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), the change can lead to different flow patterns, instabilities, or transitions to turbulence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
