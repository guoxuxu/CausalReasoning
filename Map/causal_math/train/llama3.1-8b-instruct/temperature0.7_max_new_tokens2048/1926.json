  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int e^{-sx} v(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function at time \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( T(u(x,T)) \\\\), can we retrieve the exact initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation parameters (i.e., the value of \\\\( s \\\\) in the exponential function), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\). The transformation might alter or lose information critical for accurately reconstructing the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
