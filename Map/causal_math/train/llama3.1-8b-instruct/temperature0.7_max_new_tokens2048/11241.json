  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + N \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of system states. The system's behavior is analyzed under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = C e^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + N \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( h(x) \\\\) transforms the initial state, it modifies the trajectory based on the matrices \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). These transformations change the initial conditions and thus influence the trajectory, leading to a system state at time T that differs from the unaltered process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
