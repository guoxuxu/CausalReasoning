  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We're studying the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we apply a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( T(z) \\\\) for t = T > t_1 be influenced solely by the operation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) and not by \\\\( U(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) may alter the system state at or before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) which affects the whole subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that will modify how \\\\( T(z) \\\\) ultimately computes at any t > t_1. This changes the trajectory in a manner dependent also on \\\\( U(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
