  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be precisely deduced at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could have rotated the initial point, the observed result at t = T could correspond to multiple possible initial points \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The rotation introduced makes it impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
