  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( q(x) = Mx \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) introduce modifying factors via K and M respectively, affecting the trajectory that the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will follow. Thus, the final state depends on the initial control by K, the intervention by M, and the operation of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
