  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nKnowing the state of the system at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact transformation or combinations of transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformations \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Gt} \\\\) could interact or overlay their effects in various ways, there are multiple transformation pathways leading to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were precisely used without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
