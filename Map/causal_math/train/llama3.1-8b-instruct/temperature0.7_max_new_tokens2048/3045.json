  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This function is transformed by the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\} \\\\). We explore whether causal relationships about the properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be discerned from the transformed function.\n\nDoes the pole of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = -a \\\\) imply that the time-domain function's growth rate is solely dictated by \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The location of the pole of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) at \\\\( s = -a \\\\) directly corresponds to the exponential term in the time-domain function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), indicative of the growth rate being governed by \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
