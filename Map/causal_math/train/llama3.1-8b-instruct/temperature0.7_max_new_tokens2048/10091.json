  "Problem": "Consider the inversion of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + cz\\\\) where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. We assess the effect of the Laplace transform on the inversion process determined by the equation \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{az}g(z))(s)\\\\) where \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is another function of \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain point, an additional function \\\\(h(z) = e^{bz}z\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is a complex constant) is applied, impacting \\\\(z\\\\) in the function formulation, will the resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) be independent of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) introduces an additional layer of complexity that affects the overall system response. The resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) will depend on both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) since the newly added system variables interact dynamically, altering the final output of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
