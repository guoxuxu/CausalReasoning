  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate how transformations defined by the integral transformation \\\\(T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\alpha s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with constant \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), affect the function over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve as is without further intervention, will the function \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) at t = T match the untransformed \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) changes the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating it with an exponential factor, resulting in a new function that does not merely oscillate like \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The resultant function is a complex integral that retains the effect of both the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the exponential decay/ growth factor \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), leading to dynamics that differ fundamentally from the untransformed function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
