  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nKnowing that \\\\(x(t)\\\\) satisfies \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), can we conclusively trace back to determine whether the initial vector was \\\\(x_0\\\\) or \\\\(Mx_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\(x_0\\\\) and \\\\(Mx_0\\\\) satisfy the equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) when M is invertible, observing \\\\(x(t)\\\\) satisfying the equation does not uniquely determine whether the transformation was applied or not; both are valid preconditions without further distinguishing information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
