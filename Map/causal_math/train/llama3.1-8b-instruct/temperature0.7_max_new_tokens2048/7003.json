  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the modified state at any later time T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and only reflect the last transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by both transformations due to the compounded effects of complex exponentials \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{mt} \\\\), showcasing a dependency on both the initial and intervened transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
