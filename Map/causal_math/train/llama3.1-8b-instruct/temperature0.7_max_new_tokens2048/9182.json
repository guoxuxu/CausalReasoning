  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\), where A is a 2x2 constant matrix. Observe the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\), where P is a constant invertible 2x2 matrix, and its effects on the solutions.\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original starting vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) if we do not know whether a transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\(Px\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(x_0\\\\) because the transformation could alter the initial conditions irreversibly, especially given that the matrix P might not be commutative with A or its exponential.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
