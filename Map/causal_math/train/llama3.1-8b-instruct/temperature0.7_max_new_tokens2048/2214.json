  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\( v \\) be uniquely determined by observing \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\) and knowing \\( A \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\) and \\( A \\), \\( v \\) can be exactly recovered by computing \\( v = e^{-AT}z(T) \\), assuming \\( A \\) is non-singular. The invertibility of \\( e^{AT} \\) allows for the precise reconstruction of \\( v \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
