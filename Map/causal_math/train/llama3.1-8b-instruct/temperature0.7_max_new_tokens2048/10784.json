  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. Let \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) be the velocity field, and suppose a transformation by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a stream function representing a perturbation.\n\nGiven the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what perturbations were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, T) \\\\) may result from various combinations or sequences of perturbations. The non-linear and complex nature of the Navier-Stokes equations makes it challenging to exactly trace back and identify specific perturbations or their effects based solely on the endpoint characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
