  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain the specific interventions applied (whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\), \\\\( u(z) \\\\), or both), solely through the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is uncertain due to the alterations each transformation makes on the phase and amplitude independently. The transformations \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) can yield equivalent results at certain configurations, obscuring which interventions were used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
