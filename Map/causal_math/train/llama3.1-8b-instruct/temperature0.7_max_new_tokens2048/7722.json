  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int e^{At} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is a scalar function. This setup explores how changes in \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( f \\\\) influence the behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), is it possible to determine uniquely whether the transformation was generated using \\\\( A \\\\) or a different matrix just from the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without access to the definition of \\\\( f(s) \\\\) or additional metadata?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of details about \\\\( f(s) \\\\) and potential similarities in the behavior of exponential matrices can cause different matrices to yield similar results, making it impossible to uniquely back-calculate the exact matrix used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
