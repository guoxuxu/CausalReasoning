  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in the domain describing a physical system. The transformation is defined by an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( v(x) = (T u)(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} U(x, y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\( U(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\), and aware of an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine what transformations (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied, just by analyzing \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of different kernel functions and the potentially similar results they can produce under the operator \\\\( A \\\\), it is challenging to precisely attribute the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) to specific transformations. The interactions between the kernels and the operator may yield indistinguishable outcomes, making accurate backward inference difficult.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
