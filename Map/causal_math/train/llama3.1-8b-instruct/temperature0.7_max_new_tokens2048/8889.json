  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod is guided by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. The rod's initial temperature profile is altered by a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) represents a specific heat profile added along the rod.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature profile \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time t be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to time t under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial temperature profile, adding \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to it. This alteration changes the initial conditions and thus the evolution pathway of the temperature distribution over time according to the heat equation, resulting in a different temperature distribution at any later time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
