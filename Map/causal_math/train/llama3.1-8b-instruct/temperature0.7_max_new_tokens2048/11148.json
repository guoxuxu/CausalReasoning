  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations expressed as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a linear transformation in a vector space. A specific operator \\\\(T(x) = e^{Mt}x\\\\) is applied, with M being another linear matrix, affecting x through an exponential transformation.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can the prior applications of transformations (either \\\\(T(x)\\\\), \\\\(U(x)\\\\), or both) be conclusively identified, based solely on the outcome \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could have been produced through various combinations or sequences of transformations due to the properties of matrix exponentiation, which include nontrivial interaction and overlap in the effects on the vector space. Isolating specific interventions merely by outcome is thus unreliable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
