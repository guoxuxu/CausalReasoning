  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined over time, where the state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time t is influenced by \\\\(z_0\\\\) and a transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) a real constant. We investigate the role of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Bz\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = Cz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix, is applied at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on the dynamics defined by \\\\(A\\\\) and not on the transformations by \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interjection of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) modifies the trajectory from \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards, leading to a terminal state of \\\\((e^{iA(T-t_1)})(Cz(t_1))\\\\). This state is influenced by both the dynamic matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and the intervention matrices \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), affecting the state evolution in intricate ways.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
