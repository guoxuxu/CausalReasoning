  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. The transformation of this function under a Laplace transform is investigated.\n\nIf a matrix B modifies the complex function to \\\\( f(z) = e^{(A+B)z} \\\\), and a Laplace transform is applied, does the result solely depend on A?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation via matrix B changes the function to \\\\( e^{(A+B)z} \\\\). Thus, the Laplace transform now depends on the new matrix \\\\( A + B \\\\), resulting in \\\\( (sI - (A + B))^{-1} \\\\). This outcome is influenced by both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
