  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) is a constant. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) versus simply evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven only the state \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t=T \\\\), can we precisely determine whether the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform, or both were applied at any point in the past?",
  "Explanation": "The state at time \\\\( T \\\\) could arise from multiple configurations and transformations owing to the properties and interactions between the Fourier and Laplace transforms. These transforms complicate tracing back to specific interventions uniquely, as similar states could be achieved through different combinations of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
