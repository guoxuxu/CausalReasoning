  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), and an external heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) is introduced that affects the temperature. The impact of heat source transformation defined by \\\\( u(x,t) = u(x,t) + h(x,t) \\\\) on temperature distribution is analyzed.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) of the temperature distribution, can we determine if a heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was applied throughout the entire duration up to T without additional data or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about initial conditions or the functional form of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), it is impossible to definitively ascertain whether the temperature distribution changes were due solely to the heat source or other factors incidental to the original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
