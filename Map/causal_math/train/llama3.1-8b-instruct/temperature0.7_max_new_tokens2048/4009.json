  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\) where \\(M\\) is also a diagonalizable matrix and \\(S\\) is the matrix that diagonalizes \\(D\\).\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( h(x) \\) modifies the initial condition \\( x_0 \\) to \\( S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx_0 \\). Given \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0 \\), when transformed by \\( h(x) \\), it becomes \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx_0 \\). \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( e^{Dt} \\) might not commute, resulting in a different final state \\( x(t) \\) for the same \\( t \\) value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
