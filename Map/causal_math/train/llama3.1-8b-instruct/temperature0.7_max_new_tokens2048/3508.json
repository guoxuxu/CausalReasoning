  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled with a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) representing impedance, and a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) which converts time-domain functions into the s-domain. The action is analyzing the behavior of the current function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) when subjected to an input voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\).\n\nFrom knowing the modified current response \\\\( I'(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what filters or transformations (like \\\\( F(s) \\\\)) were used, solely based on the value of \\\\( I'(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same current response at time T, \\\\( I'(T) \\\\), could result from different combinations of filtering or other transformations due to varying parameters like 'a' in the transfer function of the filter. Therefore, precise interventions can't be uniquely identified only by observing the outcome due to possible equivalent configurations leading to similar responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
