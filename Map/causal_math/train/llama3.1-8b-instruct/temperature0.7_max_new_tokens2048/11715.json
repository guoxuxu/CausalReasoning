  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by A, B, and C. Each of these contributes a rotation to the complex number, and their combined effects will directly influence the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The impact of each transformation, especially since they involve different constants, changes the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
