  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tx} dt \\\\), and we wish to analyze how transformations influence the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) through various manipulations, involving either differentiation under the integral sign or Laplace Transform.\n\nGiven the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what constant value \\\\( c \\\\) was added at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but not \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Various constants \\\\( c \\\\) added at different points or with different initial functions \\\\( z(x) \\\\) can yield the same final result under some conditions, particularly given the flexibility of integration and transformation constants in the definition of \\\\( z(x) \\\\). Thereby, knowing only the result and the point of intervention isn't enough to backtrack the precise nature of the intervention without additional specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
