  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved through \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) to T = t?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the original state by implementing an additional rotation through exponential factor \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\). The combined effect of both transformations means the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be altered, leading to a different final position at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
