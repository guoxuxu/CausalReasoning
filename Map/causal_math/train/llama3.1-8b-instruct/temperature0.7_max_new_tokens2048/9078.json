  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We explore the impact of applying an additional operation defined by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a complex function in the s-domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( H(s)F(s) \\\\) without knowing whether the multiplication with \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the transformation could have modified the spectral characteristics in such a way that reconstructing the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without this information is indeterminable, especially if \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is not trivial (e.g., not just a scalar multiple).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
