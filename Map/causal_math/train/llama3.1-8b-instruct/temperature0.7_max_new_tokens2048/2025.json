  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by a set of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')\\\\, dt'\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the differential equations without any further intervention, will the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) had evolved directly to t = T without the application of \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the function by integrating its exponential over time, which changes the trajectory of its evolution under the system's dynamics. The effects of integrating with the exponential matrix \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\) can significantly alter both the growth rate and the oscillatory behavior of the resultant complex function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
