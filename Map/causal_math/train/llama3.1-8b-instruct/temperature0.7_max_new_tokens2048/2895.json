  "Problem": "Examine a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) with an initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\), where L represents a linear differential operator. We consider the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where another transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u) \\\\) is used, does the outcome \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still rely on the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and the subsequent intervention \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) both influence the solution at \\\\( T \\\\). Because transformations can modify the functional space and the effect of the operator L, the resultant state depends on both the initial and intervened transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
