  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx + Mu\\\\), where L and M are constant matrices and u represents control input. Let's explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}x dt\\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, on the system.\n\nBy examining the final system state \\\\(x(t)\\\\), can we definitively trace back and identify both the initial transformation (whether \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied or not) and the change in control input from \\\\(u\\\\) to \\\\(v\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) might not uniquely specify the earlier interventions such as the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) and the modification of the control input because of the overlay of effects, making it difficult to unravel the specific historical sequence of events and interventions from the final observed state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
