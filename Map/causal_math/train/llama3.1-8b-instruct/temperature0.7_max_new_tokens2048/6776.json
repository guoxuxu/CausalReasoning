  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + q(x)y = \\\\lambda y \\\\), with boundary conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(1) = 0 \\\\). Here, \\\\( q(x) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how transformations \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) (where k is a constant multiplier) affect the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this system.\n\nCan we identify what intervention \\\\( f(y) = ky \\\\) or altered condition \\\\( -\\\\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + (q(x) + h(x))y = \\\\lambda y \\\\) led to a particular eigenfunction \\\\( y(x) \\\\), just by observing it in the context of the original unaltered problem?",
  "Explanation": "Since both scaling by k and changing the potential function can independently produce variations of eigenfunctions, observation alone of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) under the original conditions provides insufficient information to conclusively determine the specific interventions or changes made to the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
