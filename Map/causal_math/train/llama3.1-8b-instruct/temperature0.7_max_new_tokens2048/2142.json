  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where initial data points are mapped in a complex plane according to the function \\\\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( i \\\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant, and \\\\\\( t \\\\\\) is time. We examine the effect of another transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\\\) introduced as an intervention, where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = T \\\\\\), can we infer the exact initial value \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) purely based on this magnitude, assuming no intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "While the magnitude of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) provides information about the magnitude of \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\), it does not offer any clues about its phase. Without the phase information, the exact value of \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in the complex plane cannot be uniquely determined just from its magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
