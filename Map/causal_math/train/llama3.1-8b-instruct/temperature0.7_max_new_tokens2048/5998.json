  "Problem": "We consider a mathematical model where two complex variables, z and w, are related via the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\) at an initial time t = 0. Over time, w evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\), with A being a complex constant. We examine the influence of an early intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\) defined by the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\( z(t) \\) at t = T, can we deduce the original value \\( z_0 \\) and w at t = 0 without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(w) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of whether \\( f(z) \\) was initially applied and without knowledge of the value of w at t = 0 or the application of \\( g(w) \\), it is not possible to reliably trace back to \\( z_0 \\) and w since w affects z dynamically through \\( f(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
