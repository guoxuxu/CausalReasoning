  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\( T[L[g]](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\) can we uniquely determine the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) were used, based solely on the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The end transformation result \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\) could potentially be due to a variety of function setups and differential operator or integral transform choices. Without information about the specific structure of \\\\( L \\\\) or the original function, multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) with various operator choices could provide the same outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
