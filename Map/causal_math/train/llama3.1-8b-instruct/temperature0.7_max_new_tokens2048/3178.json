  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system defined by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a matrix representing system dynamics. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\( L \\{x(t)\\} \\), and then modifying this transform with a filter defined by the function \\( H(s) \\), where s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nCan the initial condition \\( x_0 \\) be uniquely determined from \\( x(T) \\) after the transformation \\( H(s) \\) has been applied to \\( L \\{x(t)\\} \\) without knowing \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( H(s) \\) modifies the spectral characteristics of the system's response in a way that cannot be reversed without knowing the specifics of \\( H(s) \\). This alteration masks the original spectral content associated with \\( x_0 \\), making it impossible to retrieve \\( x_0 \\) uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
