  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( G(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the integral transformation and not on the nature of \\\\( f \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new complex scaling on the evolving variable, which will alter both the magnitude and phase of z. This, combined with the initial rotational effect from \\\\( f(z) \\\\), means that the final result of \\\\( G(z(T)) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations and not just the integral transformation alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
