  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the response of a complex system under the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) while iterating through scenarios of system modification or the imposition of a boundary condition.\n\nIf the Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is calculated for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially, and then the system is allowed to evolve naturally under the time translation, will the future form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) match the antitransform prediction from this initial transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its antitransform under time translation form an exact reversible pair, making the computed future state from the original Laplace transform correct. Transform properties ensure consistency across the time-shifted predictions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
