  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is also a constant complex number.\n\nAfter observing the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial function \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\) from 0 to T without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?\", ",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the exact original function \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\), as the transformation could have significantly altered the evolution path, particularly because the impacts of N in the integral transformation are not generally deducible from the final state under M alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
