  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). This system deals with an input signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over time t, where the output signal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) represents the system's response in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an impulse function \\\\( g(t) = \\delta(t - t_1) \\\\) is added at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention in the system, will this change the result of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from what would have been obtained without the intervention, considering \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding an impulse function will indeed modify \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The Laplace Transform of \\\\( \\delta(t - t_1) \\\\) is \\\\( e^{-st_1} \\\\), which will additively alter the original transform, showing a dependency on the intervention and altering the expected output from solely being \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
