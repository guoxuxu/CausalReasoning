  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is applied at some point between \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will the resulting function at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) be dependent only on the effects of matrix A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the system, influenced by matrix B. Thus, even at point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), the function reflects combined influences of both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
