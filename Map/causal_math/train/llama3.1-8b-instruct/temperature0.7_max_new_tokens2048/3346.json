  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i \\\\theta}z\\\\) acts on a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) in the complex plane. Here, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a real number representing a rotation angle. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\) for dynamics given by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant, is considered.\n\nObserving \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can it be definitely stated whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The effect at \\\\(t = T\\\\), a position on the complex circle, could be reached by numerous initial conditions and rotations. Without exact information on \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) or the initial position \\\\(z_0\\\\), the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) cannot be conclusively determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
