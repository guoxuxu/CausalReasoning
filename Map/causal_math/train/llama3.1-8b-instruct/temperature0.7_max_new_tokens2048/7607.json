  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We also consider the impact of Laplace transformation on this function, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive real number) is introduced at some time \\\\( t_0 > 0 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the modified function only depend on the original parameters k and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a damping factor modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function will not only depend on the original parameters but also significantly on the newly introduced \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), as it changes the convergence and nature of the exponential term in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
