  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a system in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (P + iQ)z \\\\), with real matrices P and Q. Examine the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{(C + iD)t}z \\\\), where C and D are also real matrices.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{(E + iF)t}z \\\\) (where E and F are constant matrices) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original operators P and Q, and not the matrices C, D, E, and F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifying factors. As such, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on all matrices involved: P, Q, C, D, E, and F. Exponential transformations affect both the amplitude and phase, influencing the ending condition of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
