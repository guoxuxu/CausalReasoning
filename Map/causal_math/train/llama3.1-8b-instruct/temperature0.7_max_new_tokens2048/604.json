  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined over the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{aw^2 + bw} dw \\\\) where a and b are constants. We are interested in the causal influence of changes in parameters a and b, or transformations on w, on the resulting function values computed by z.\n\nKnowing the value of z(w) at T, can we precisely trace back whether the change in parameter b or the transformation of w or both took place?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the interactions within the integral and the exponential reactivity to changes in both the parameters and transformations, z(w) output can align with numerous potential alterations in b or transformations of w. Without additional information, it is impossible to definitively attribute the observed z(w) to specific changes or interventions in parameters or variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A change in parameter b causes a change in z, and a transformation of w also causes a change in z."
