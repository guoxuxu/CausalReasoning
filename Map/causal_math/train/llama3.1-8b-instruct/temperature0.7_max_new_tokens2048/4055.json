  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\} = U(s, x) \\\\) and the subsequent inversion to the time domain.\n\nIf an additional boundary condition modulated by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is inserted at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the evolution, will the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t > t_1 solely depend on the initial function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and independent of the new boundary condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Once a boundary condition is inserted as an intervention, the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) becomes dependent on this new condition. The differential equation hence integrates this boundary effect throughout the subsequent evolution of the system, modifying the profile of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at any time after \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
