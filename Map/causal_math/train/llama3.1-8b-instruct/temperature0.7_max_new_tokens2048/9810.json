  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation under a Fourier transformation, denoted as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k^2 \\\\hat{u} + \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) is a transformed external force. The parameter k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nBased on the transformed wave equation's dynamics, if \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\) is given for some t>0, can the initial state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(k) \\\\) be uniquely determined without knowing if any force \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\), even if it is zero, one cannot uniquely trace back to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(k) \\\\) because any arbitrary introduction of \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) could align with the observed state at t>0, altering the original setup of the equation.",
