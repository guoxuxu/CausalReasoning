  "Problem": "Let's consider the vector space transformation by the integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), known as the Laplace Transform. We study the behavior when the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, transforms under this operation.\n\nGiven the transformation \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) at initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), applied directly without modification, does the transform solely depend on the properties of A?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, since \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), the output of the Laplace Transform, \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\), will depend directly on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The Laplace Transform computes the system's response in the s-domain and is purely dependent on how \\\\( A \\\\) defines the excitation function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
