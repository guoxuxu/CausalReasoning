  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) which is derived as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\), where A represents a constant. The system is studied under a Heaviside step function input \\\\( u(t) = 1(t) \\\\) converted into the Laplace domain to form \\\\( U(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\). The output in the Laplace domain is then \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at a certain transformed frequency s, can we uniquely determine the value of A in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - A} \\\\) assuming no other system information is manipulated or interfered with?",
  "Explanation": "While you can infer properties of A if \\\\( H(s) \\\\) typology is known, there could exist multiple values of A that produce the same output characteristics under specific conditions of s or congenial transformations of input, making it non-unique without additional system specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
