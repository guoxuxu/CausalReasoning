  "Problem": "Consider the transform \\\\( z = f(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\), which maps the input x to a complex domain. We analyze how the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) impacts the causality and the influence of various interventions represented by other transforms such as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( f(T) \\\\) adjusted by further application of \\\\( g(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which original transform (\\\\( f(x) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x) \\\\)) or both were applied only by knowing the final combined output?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the unique properties and non-linearity of the exponential and sinusoidal functions involved, the final output could be the result of several combinations of these transformations. This complexity, compounded by their overlapping effects, makes it impossible to decouple and identify the precise interventions used solely from the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
