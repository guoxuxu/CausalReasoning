  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an inductor and a resistor in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( I \\\\) is the current, \\\\( L \\\\) is the inductance, \\\\( R \\\\) is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent voltage source. We examine the impact of an initial transformation of the current by \\\\( f(I) = I_0e^{kt} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) observed at some time t, can we deduce the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) specifically at t = 0, without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) was applied, and how k relates to the properties of the circuit (e.g., L and R), it is impossible to uniquely determine the precise initial current at t = 0 since both the transformation and the system dynamics alter the response over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The current I is directly influenced by the inductance L and the resistance R, and the time-dependent voltage source V(t). The derivative of the current dI/dt is directly influenced by the current I. The current I is directly influenced by the transformation f(I). The current I at time t is directly influenced by the initial current I_0 and the constant k, which affects the transformation f(I)."
