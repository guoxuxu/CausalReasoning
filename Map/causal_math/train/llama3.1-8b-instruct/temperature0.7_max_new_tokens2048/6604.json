  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We explore the behavior of the function under different transformations and integration conditions.\n\nAfter applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) = ax + b \\\\) and calculating \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\), is it possible to deduce the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) solely from the resulting \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it is not feasible to reverse engineer the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) from \\\\( z(h(x)) \\\\). The transformation parameters critically affect how the integral's limits and integrand are modified, necessary information for deconvolving back to \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
