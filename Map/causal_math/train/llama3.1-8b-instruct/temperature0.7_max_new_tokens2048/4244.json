  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant scalar and \\\\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. We study the effect of the Laplace transform on this function over time interval \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), including its frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), only by analyzing the output of the derivative intervention in the Laplace domain followed by the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "While the derivative operation in the Laplace domain and subsequent inverse transform affect the function's form, without prior information about the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or detailed knowledge of manipulations during the intervention, we cannot reliably determine the exact original frequency due to the non-unique correspondence between frequency and transformed signal characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
