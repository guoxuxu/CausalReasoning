  "Problem": "Consider a system under a linear transformation described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) changes the domain and the characteristics of the function z(t), moving from time domain to frequency domain. This transformation does not merely shift z(t) but alters its fundamental representation, hence the trajectory under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) post-transformation is not the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
