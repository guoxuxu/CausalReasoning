  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent functions defined in a physical system. The causal inference is analyzed through the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), where complex frequency s incorporates both decay and oscillatory behaviors.\n\nIf an initial impedance \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is modified by a Laplace transform, and then the system evolves under natural conditions with no additional transformations, will the future modelling of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > 0 be equivalently described by the Laplace transform of the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without using \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) via the Laplace mechanism significantly alters the frequency domain representation and behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The evolution post-transformation will reflect the initial modification, thus differing from the scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
