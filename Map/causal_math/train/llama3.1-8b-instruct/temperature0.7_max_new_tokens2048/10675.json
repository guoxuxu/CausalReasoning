  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Sturm-Liouville problem \\\\( -\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx}\\\\right) + q(x)y = \\\\lambda w(x)y \\\\), where \\\\( p(x), q(x), w(x) \\\\) are given functions and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is the eigenvalue. An integral transformation \\\\( T[y](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} k(x, t)y(t)dt \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( k(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf an intervention alters the kernel to \\\\( k'(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( k' \\\\) differs from \\\\( k \\\\)), will the final state of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) depend solely on the original Sturm-Liouville operators and not on the changes in the kernel?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel to \\\\( k'(x, t) \\\\) during the transformation process introduces a new set of conditions and potential modifications to the resultant function's behavior under the Sturm-Liouville problem. This change affects how the function aligns with the eigenvalue problem, making the final state dependent on both the original and altered kernel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
