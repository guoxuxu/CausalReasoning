  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain point we introduce an additional modifying function \\\\( k(s) \\\\) applied specifically at a single value of \\\\( s_0 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( F(z) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial form of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( k(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the function \\\\( k(s) \\\\) affects the integrand at \\\\( s_0 \\\\) and modifies the integral computation. This intervention affects the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), hence making it dependent not only on \\\\( g(s) \\\\) but also on \\\\( k(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
