  "Problem": "Consider a function space in which solutions to the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 f = 0 \\\\) are investigated, and let \\\\( g(x,y) = x^2 - y^2 \\\\) be a transformation applied to any function \\\\( f \\\\) in this space. Examine the impacts of applying another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(f) = f + \\\\lambda xy \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(f) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f_0(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) and then this function is transformed by \\\\( g \\\\), will the resulting function at the end still satisfy the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 f = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(f) \\\\) results in a function \\\\( f + \\\\lambda xy \\\\), which alters the harmonic nature of the function. While \\\\( x^2 + y^2 \\\\) is harmonic, the addition of \\\\( \\\\lambda xy \\\\) introduces terms that do not satisfy the Laplace equation upon transformation by \\\\( g \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
