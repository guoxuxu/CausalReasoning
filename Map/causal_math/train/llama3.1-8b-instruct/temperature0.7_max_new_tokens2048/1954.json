  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\) applied at different instances.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the matrices A and B that govern the individual components x and y of z?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation aggregates the effects of A and B into a combined transform. Without additional information on how A and B individually affect x and y, or additional constraints such as commutativity, it's impossible to uniquely decompose them solely from \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
