  "Problem": "Consider a physical system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a region R. An external force is modelled by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) that modifies the boundary conditions of R at time t = 0. We analyze the effect of this initial condition and subsequent interventions on the solution u(x, y, t) across the domain.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x, y, T) \\\\), can we exclusively determine the initial boundary condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) if there was an unknown intervention at some time t1 before T?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of whether there was an intervention, or what that intervention was (\\\\( k(x, y) \\\\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial boundary condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) based on the solution at time T, due to the additional variable introduced during the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
