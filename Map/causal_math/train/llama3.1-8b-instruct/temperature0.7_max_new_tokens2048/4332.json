  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model with complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex number. We explore the effects of the Laplace Transform on this function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\), to transform from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transformed function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) resulting from an unknown intervention using \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we determine solely from \\\\( h(s) \\\\) whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or a different function \\\\( q(t) \\\\) was used as the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention function from the resultant Laplace Transformed function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is generally infeasible without additional context or constraints. Multiple different functions could result in similar or even identical transforms, making unique identification challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
