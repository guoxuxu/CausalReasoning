  "Problem": "Evaluate the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\) on the real function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when transformed using the Laplace Transform. Let the original system be governed by \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the function at time t, can we deduce the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( z(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( z(s) \\\\) (the complex function) was applied, it would alter the Laplace Transform in a way that's nontrivial to reverse without explicit knowledge of its application, due to the nonlinear modification represented by \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace Transform of a function does not uniquely determine the original function, as there can be multiple functions with the same Laplace Transform."
