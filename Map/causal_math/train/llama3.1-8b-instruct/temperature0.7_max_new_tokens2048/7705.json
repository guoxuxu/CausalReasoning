  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original PDE \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) by multiplying \\\\( u_0 \\\\) by \\\\( e^{ikx} \\\\) modifies the solution's structure, possibly altering how the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) acts on the function over time. This results in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
