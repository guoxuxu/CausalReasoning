  "Problem": "Imagine a system where we want to study heat transfer in a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the material. We analyze the scenario where at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) is initially applied, and then see its evolution or the effects of interventions.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we reliably reconstruct the exact initial distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without knowing its initial form?",
  "Explanation": "Inferring the precise initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can be challenging without additional assumptions about its form, due to the diffusive nature of the heat equation which smooths and spreads the initial distribution over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
