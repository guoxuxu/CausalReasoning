  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a real constant, over time \\\\( t \\\\) is scrutinized.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the endpoints?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the interventions used solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the non-distinct and overlapping potential effects from each exponential transformation. Different interventions could lead to the same outcome, especially considering the complex interactions between the transformations in the context of complex exponential growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
