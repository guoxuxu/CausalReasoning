  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the system's inherent dynamics under \\\\( -i\\\\lambda \\\\), and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be represented as \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda (T - t_1)} e^{i\\\\theta} e^{-i\\\\lambda t_1} e^{i\\\\omega t_1} z_0 \\\\), showing dependencies on all parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
