  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation represented by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iws} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time t, can you uniquely recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information or reverse operations?",
  "Explanation": "The operation performed by \\\\( T \\\\) integrates the function with a decaying exponential, which loses certain information about the phase and amplitude variations in the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) that cannot be uniquely recovered just from \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
