  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We inspect the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(x)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t) e^{-ist} dt \\\\) applied to the function x(t), and then analyze the behavior under the system dynamics.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the use of the Fourier transform, the originally transformed state of the function may have undergone changes that cannot be simply reversed, particularly if L modifies the frequency constituents greatly and non-uniformly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x_T can be influenced by the system dynamics L and the original function x_0, and the state x_T is directly related to the state x, which can be transformed by the Fourier transform."
