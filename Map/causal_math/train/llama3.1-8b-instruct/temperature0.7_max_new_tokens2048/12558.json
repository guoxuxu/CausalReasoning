  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nSuppose an intervention is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by modifying the conditions via an additional Fourier filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\), does the end state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original differential operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and not the filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the additional Fourier filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) alters the subsequent state evolution, affecting both the amplitude and phase characteristics in the frequency domain. Thus, the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\\\) incorporates effects of both the original operator and the characteristics of the filter applied mid-evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
