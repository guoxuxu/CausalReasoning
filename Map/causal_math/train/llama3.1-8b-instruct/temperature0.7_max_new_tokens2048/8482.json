  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = {\\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sA} x(s) ds} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function defined by some physical or chemical process. We assess the effect of the linear operator \\\\( L(z) = Bz \\\\), with B being another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf we observe the system's state at some time t, can we conclusively infer the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if the operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, the transformation by B could significantly change the trajectory from its initial state. The lack of this knowledge precludes exact back-calculation of \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
