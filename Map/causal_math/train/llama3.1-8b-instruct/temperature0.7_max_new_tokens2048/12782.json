  "Problem": "Imagine analyzing the influence on a solution space by the operator \\\\( T: V \\\\rightarrow V \\\\) in the context of linear algebra, where T is defined as \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) for a matrix A and S is a linear subspace of V which is invariant under T. Consider the subsequent application of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\), where B is another matrix, to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S.\n\nAssuming that at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another operator \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\) (where C is a different matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of the system depend solely on A with neither B nor C influencing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at a later time t = T is influenced by the successive transformations by B and C, as well as the applications of T. Since B and C each change the vector in possibly different ways that are not necessarily aligned with the transformations ordained by T, all matrices (A, B, and C) will influence the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
