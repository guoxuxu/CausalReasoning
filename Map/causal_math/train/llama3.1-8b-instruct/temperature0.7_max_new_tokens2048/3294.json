  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a set of linear differential equations with characteristics matrix \\\\(M\\\\). An input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is applied, modeled by the function \\\\(V(t) = e^{St}V_0\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is a constant matrix. The response of the circuit, represented by the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\), is initially determined by the impulse response matrix \\\\(H\\\\).\n\nCan the original settings of \\\\(V_0\\\\) be accurately deduced from observing \\\\(I(T)\\\\), the current at time T, without prior knowledge of whether \\\\(e^{St}\\\\) transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial voltage impact altered by \\\\(e^{St}\\\\) leads to varied potential outputs, making it infeasible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\(V_0\\\\) without clear knowledge of the transformation application. As such, the matrix \\\\(S\\\\) could introduce irreversible changes in the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
