  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) undergoing the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane. The system's behavior is analyzed against the backdrop of an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), with s as a complex parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves freely without further intervention, will the integral transform \\\\( Z_0(s) \\\\) of the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of the transformed function after time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a time-dependent rotation, which impacts the values and path of the integral transform. These changes due to the rotation component \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) affect the convergence and values of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), differentiating it from \\\\( Z_0(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
