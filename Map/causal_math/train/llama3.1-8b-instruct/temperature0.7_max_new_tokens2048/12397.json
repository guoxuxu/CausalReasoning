  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t governed by a set of linear differential equations in a matrix form \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) with M being a constant matrix. We evaluate how an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without the knowledge of whether the Laplace transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the Laplace transform (if applied) on \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be uncoupled uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the absence of additional information about application of the transform or not. The transform integrates exponential and function properties that can obscure the initial state details necessary for accurate reconstruction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
