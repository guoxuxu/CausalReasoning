  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. The transformation function considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the system evolves under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), having no effect initially, but the complex multiplication factor changes the trajectory through exponential rotation which interacts differently with the original system coefficients, resulting in a trajectory that differs from the untransformed path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
