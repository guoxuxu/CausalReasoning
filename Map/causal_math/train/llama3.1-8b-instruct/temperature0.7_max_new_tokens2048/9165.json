  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) changes the magnitude of the initial condition, which modifies the trajectory of the function over time. The growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) compounds the effect of the oscillatory behavior governed by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), leading to a different magnitude and potentially different trajectory than if evolved directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
