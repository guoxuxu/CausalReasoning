  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) and then Fourier transformed, will the transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) still primarily peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a damping factor shifts the Fourier transform’s peak from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to a value depending on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\). The influence of the exponential decay modifies the dominant frequency, thereby affecting the peak location in the transformed spectrum.",
