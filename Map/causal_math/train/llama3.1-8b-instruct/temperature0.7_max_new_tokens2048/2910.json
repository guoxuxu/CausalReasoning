  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transform \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. This scenario explores both the direct evolution of the function and the impact of modifications through an operational function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final output of the transform \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), is it possible to recover the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without confirmation if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) precisely from \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is infeasible because the initial modifications introduced by \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could entirely reshape the integrand and outcome, obscuring the original form and behavior of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
