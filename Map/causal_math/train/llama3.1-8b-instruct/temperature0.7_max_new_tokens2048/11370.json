  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system defined by \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. Evaluate the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we ascertain the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) was applied at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking the knowledge about the initial application of \\\\( C \\\\), it is impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( x \\\\) since multiple initial conditions can evolve to the same \\\\( y(T) \\\\) depending on the presence or absence of the transformation \\\\( C \\\\) and the properties of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
