  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) over the domain [0,1], where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined by the integral transformation \\\\( Lf(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\) and \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function representing a complex interaction.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) without further changes, will the resulting function after the transformation have its integral over [0,1] equal to the integral of \\\\( x^2 \\\\) over [0,1]?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) transforms the function \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) dependent on the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\). Since the integration process involves the entire function and the kernel, the transformation modifies the resultant function's shape and hence its integral over [0,1], making it generally different from the integral of the original \\\\( x^2 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
