  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex function, and both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The interaction between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) via \\\\( u \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nBy knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the exact initial vectors \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and possible non-linear interactions presented by \\\\( u \\\\), the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from multiple combinations of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\). Thus, without clear information about how \\\\( u \\\\) initially modified the states or trajectories, these initial conditions cannot be uniquely resolved from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
