  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where the function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), with C being a real constant. The evolution of the system is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral operator \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system by creating a new function from the history of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) up to t, thus altering the resultant trajectory. The complex exponential \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\) affects the phase and nature of the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
