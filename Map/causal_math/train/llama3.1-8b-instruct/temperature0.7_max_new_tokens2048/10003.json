  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) with an initial input \\( z_0 \\). The system undergoes a transformation \\( h(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Et}z dt \\), where E is a constant matrix and T is the final time.\n\nIf at some time \\( t_1 < T \\), a new transformation \\( k(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{Ft}z dt \\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\( z(T) \\) depend only on D, not on E or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( k(z) \\) introduces additional changes governed by the matrix exponential \\( e^{Ft} \\), which accumulates effects alongside earlier influences from \\( e^{Et} \\). Thus, the final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on D, E, and F because of their combined impacts through the respective transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
