  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is considered for modeling the effect of time-dependent rotations on this system.\n\nCan we determine the precise original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature and inherent characteristics of the governing equation and transformation, reverse-engineering to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is possible. The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), being a simple rotation, preserves the magnitudes and can be mathematically inverted and factored out to recover the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
