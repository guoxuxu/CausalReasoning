  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and the function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane. This function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) which is the Laplace transform, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf a modification is made by changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform still be a clear function of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) without any signs of \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by modifying \\\\( \\omega \\\\) alters the exponential term in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which directly affects the Laplace transform. The new parameter \\\\( \\delta \\\\) combined with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) results in a different decay or growth rate in the exponential term, hence the resultant transform reflects both \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
