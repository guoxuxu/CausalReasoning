  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^4 + i \\\\cdot t^3 \\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation on this function over time t.\n\nBy observing the Laplace transformed version of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we recover the exact functional form of \\\\( z(t) = t^4 + i \\\\cdot t^3 \\\\) without prior knowledge of its form?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform allows the recovery of the original function from its transformed version. Assuming that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is well-behaved and that sufficient conditions are met (e.g., linearity, time-domain behavior), the exact form can indeed be derived from its Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
