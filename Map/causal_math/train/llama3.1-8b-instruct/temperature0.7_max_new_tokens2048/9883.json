  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We explore the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation represented by a wavelet transform \\\\(W(u)\\\\) is introduced at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final Fourier transformed state \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original differential equation, unaffected by the wavelet transform?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a wavelet transform as an intervention modifies the spatial characteristics and respective frequency components of the state, which then evolves differently under the differential equation. Thus, the final Fourier transformed state \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) is affected by both the original dynamics and the wavelet intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
