  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a complex constant vector. This scenario investigates the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{iBt}w \\\\) where B is also a real constant, and how it modifies the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(w) = e^{iCt}w \\\\) (where C is another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( k(w) \\\\) introduces another evolving factor affecting the trajectory itself. Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be a result of the interplay among A, B, and C. The transformations \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) affect the trajectory in a complex manner, involving phase shifts and vector orientations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
