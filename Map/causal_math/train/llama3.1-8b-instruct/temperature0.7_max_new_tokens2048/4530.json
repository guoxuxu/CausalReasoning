  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger-like equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. An intervention is defined by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\), where B is another constant matrix different from A.\n\nCan we precisely infer \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any time t given the action \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), but without confirmation if function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about whether or not \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied introduces uncertainty in backtracking to the original \\\\(z_0\\\\). Differentiating whether the evolution was purely from \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) or altered by \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) impacts the ability to precisely deduce the initial state since both A and B affect the development of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
