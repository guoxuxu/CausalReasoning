  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, in relation to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention via the application of an additional transformation \\\\( U(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), will the computation of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) solely be influenced by matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( U(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) complicates the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), introducing dependencies on the matrices \\\\( C \\\\), as well as \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Hence, the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depends on the interplay among all these matrices, not solely on \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
