  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\), can we pinpoint whether an intervention affecting \\( x(s) \\) was applied at \\( t_1 \\) merely by analyzing \\( z(T) \\) without full knowledge of \\( K(s, t) \\) or \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without comprehensive knowledge of the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) and the intervention matrix \\( B \\), it's challenging to discern from \\( z(T) \\) alone whether an intervention occurred. Different kernels and interventions might result in similar outputs, making it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
