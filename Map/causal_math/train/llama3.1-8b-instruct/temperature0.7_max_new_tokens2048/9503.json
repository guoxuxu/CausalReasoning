  "Problem": "Explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are distinct constant matrices. We assess the results when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf, during the evolution at a later time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is introduced, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on the matrices A and B, ignoring the effects of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by the transformations introduced by C and D, aside from the natural influences of A and B. Hence, the state at T is influenced by all four matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
