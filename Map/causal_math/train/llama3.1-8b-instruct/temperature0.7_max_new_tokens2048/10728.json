  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform result as \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\), can we specify whether any modulation like \\( e^{-i\\alpha t} \\) was applied solely based on the delta function's position?",
  "Explanation": "The delta function indicates the presence of a pure frequency, but it cannot reveal if this frequency resulted directly from \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) or from a modified function such as \\( e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} \\). The centrality of \\( \\omega' \\) matches \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) and could be interpreted as either the original or shifted frequency without additional context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
