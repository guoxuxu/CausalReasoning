  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), can we determine whether \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "If only the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) are known, it is not possible to conclusively determine if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was squared, since multiple initial conditions can evolve into the same endpoint. The squaring could lead to multiple potential initial conditions or trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
