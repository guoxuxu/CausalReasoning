  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z = g(x) \\\\) that maps a real variable x into the complex plane and a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lf = f'' + af' + bf \\\\), where a and b are real constants. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int e^{sx} f(x) dx \\\\), with a complex variable s, on the differentiability and behavior of this expression over time.\n\nIf during the transformation process, an operator \\\\( Mf = f'' - cf \\\\) for a real constant c is applied as an intervention, will \\\\( T(Mg)(s) \\\\) solely reflect changes due to M ignoring the original L and its parameters a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M \\\\) does not eliminate the influence of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( g \\\\). The resulting function will still reflect the compound effect of both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), and these influences cannot be disentangled just by examining \\\\( T(Mg) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
