  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a constant real number that dictates the rate of rotation in the complex plane. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{-At}z \\\\) over time t.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) are phase rotations in the complex plane, the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone, without knowing the specific dynamics (including time of application and rates A and B), cannot conclusively tell us which transformations were applied. This is due to the overlapping effects of complex rotations that may yield similar endpoints from different transformation sequences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
