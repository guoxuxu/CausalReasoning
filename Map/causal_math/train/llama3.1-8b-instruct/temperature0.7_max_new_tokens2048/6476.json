  "Problem": "Consider a context where z is a complex function of a real variable x, written as z(x) = u(x) + iv(x) where u and v are real-valued functions of x. We study the effects and causes considering the integral transformation T defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformation result T(z) after certain unknown interventions on z(x), can we determine precisely the nature and extent of these interventions only based on T(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation T integrates features of z(x) through an exponential weighing mechanism across all x, making it practically impossible to isolate specific interventions, such as localized alterations, without additional data about the original and intermediate forms of z. The process can obscure or remove details necessary for such an analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
