  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) \\\\) as \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - w) \\\\), can we conclusively determine \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at any prior time without further data?",
  "Explanation": "The transform result \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - w) \\\\) uniquely identifies the original function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) due to the property of the Fourier transform being a bijective operation on functions of this form. The delta function's location directly indicates the frequency component in \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
