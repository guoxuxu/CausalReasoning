  "Problem": "Examine a system characterized by the non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\\\), and consider the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( g(x) = x + k \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the same differential equation without further intervention, will the result \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to what it would have been if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) changes the initial state to \\\\( x_0 + k \\\\). Given the non-linearity of the differential equation, this shift can fundamentally alter the trajectory and thus the final state at t = T, leading to a state that is not equivalent to simple untransformed evolution from \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
