  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and then the system evolves under \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T be consistent with the evolution given only by the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear and reversible transformation that provides a representation in the frequency domain but does not alter the dynamics governed by the differential equation. The evolution of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) will adhere to the transformed version of the PDE, maintaining consistency with the initial condition transformed at t = 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
