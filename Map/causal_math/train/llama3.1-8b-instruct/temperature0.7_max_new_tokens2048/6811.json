  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the modified function and its interpretation.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by applying a differential operator \\\\( D(f)(t) = \\\\frac{df}{dt} \\\\) at a certain time, and then the Fourier transform is applied, will the nature of the transformed function depend solely on the differential operator and not on the original function characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the differential operator adds complexity by changing the rate of change aspects of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), affecting subsequent Fourier transform outcomes. The characteristics of the original function, combined with how the differential operator modifies it, influence the resultant transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
