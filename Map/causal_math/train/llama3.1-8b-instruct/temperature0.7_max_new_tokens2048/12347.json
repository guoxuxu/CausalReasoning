  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we unequivocally identify if an impulse was added at a specific time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), just by analyzing \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier Transform contains all information about the time-domain function, identifying specific interventions like an impulse addition at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone is complex due to complications such as phase and amplitude ambiguities. The identification isn't straightforward and depends heavily on the context or additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Impulse at t0 → Change in u(t); Change in u(t) → Change in z(t); Change in z(t) → Change in F(z); Unknown intervention → Change in F(z); Change in F(z) → Impulse at t0 (inverse relationship)"
