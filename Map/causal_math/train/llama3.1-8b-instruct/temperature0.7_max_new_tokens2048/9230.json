  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the system, which alters the representation to depend on frequency variables \\\\( \\omega \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly in the time domain after observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\) in the frequency domain without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the observation is in the frequency domain and it is unclear whether a Fourier transform was applied, reconstructing the precise original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) in the time domain is uncertain. Information may be lost or altered in the transformation and subsequent evolution process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
