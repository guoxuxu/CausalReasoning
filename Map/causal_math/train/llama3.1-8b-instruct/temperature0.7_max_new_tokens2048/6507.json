  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}(t-s)X(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and X(s) is a time-dependent input function. We explore the impact of modifying the input via the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(X) = e^{Ct}X(t) \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(X) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) dependent on the interaction of matrices A, B, and C through the input transformations. The multiple exponential influences can superpose, affecting the system's end trajectory and output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
