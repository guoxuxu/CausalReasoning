  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve following \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial value to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha 0} z_0 = z_0 \\\\), so initially it is the same, but as t progresses, the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) significantly modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), so that \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)t} z_0 \\\\), not merely \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) as it would be otherwise.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
