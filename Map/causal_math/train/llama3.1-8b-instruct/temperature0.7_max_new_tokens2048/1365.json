  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = te^{-t} \\\\). We further explore the role of inverse transformations and additional operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(F(s)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) and is then subjected to the inverse Laplace transform without any further manipulations, will the resulting time function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) be equivalent to the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) simply scaled by a constant factor?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain corresponds to a differentiation in the time domain, specifically \\\\( g(t) = -tf(t) - f(t) \\\\), which is not merely a scaling of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). This modifies the structure of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
