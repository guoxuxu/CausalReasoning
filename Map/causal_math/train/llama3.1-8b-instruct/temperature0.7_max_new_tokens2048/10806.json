  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate what happens when a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied on the initial temperature distribution, and later an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is used.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution at some time \\\\( t \\\\), and knowing it evolved according to the heat equation, can we correctly recover the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) by simply applying the Fourier transform followed by its inverse, all after solving for any time \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "As the process involves linear operations and the forward-inverse nature of the Fourier transforms, the recovery of the initial condition using the inverse approach after evolution and solving explicitly gives us the correct initial distribution.",
