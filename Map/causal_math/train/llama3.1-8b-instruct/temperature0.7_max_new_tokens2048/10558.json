  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), representing a rotating vector in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The effect of an external transformation is considered using the operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) with \\\\( a \\\\) being a constant.\n\nCan you infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the external transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is confounded by the unknown application of \\\\( L \\\\). The transformation could have altered the original magnitude and phase, implying that without explicit knowledge of \\\\( L's \\\\) application, multiple feasible \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could correspond to the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
