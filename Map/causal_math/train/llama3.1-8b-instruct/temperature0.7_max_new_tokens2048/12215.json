  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\( D \\\\) being a constant matrix characterizing the system dynamics and \\\\( C \\\\) being the control matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) is defined, where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used only from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is impractical due to the non-commutativity of the matrix exponentials and their combined effects on the system's trajectory. Different combinations of \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) could result in similar or identical end states under certain conditions, thereby obscuring the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
