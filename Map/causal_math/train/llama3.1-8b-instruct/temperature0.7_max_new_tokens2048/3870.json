  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\( T \\) defined by \\( T[u](x, t) = \\int K(x, y, t) u(y, t) dy \\), where \\( K \\) is a kernel function.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\( u(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( u(x, T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T[u] \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\( T[u] \\) was applied, the changes imposed by the kernel function \\( K \\) might have shifted the initial conditions in a non-reversible way, especially if \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) do not have properties that allow easy inversion or deconvolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
