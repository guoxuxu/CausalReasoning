  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used, solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for overlapping effects from the matrix exponentials applied during transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and their effects on both real and imaginary parts, it becomes impossible to distinctly discern from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone what specific interventions occurred during the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
