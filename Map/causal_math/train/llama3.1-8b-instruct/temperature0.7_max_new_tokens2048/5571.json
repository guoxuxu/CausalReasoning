  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\), is used to solve differential equations. We consider the scenario where we apply this transformation to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\) under different initial conditions and interventions.\n\nIf an intervention changes the differential equation to \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + r\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + sy = g(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), where \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is a known function, does the solution \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the new parameters r and s?",
  "Explanation": "The new solution \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) does not depend solely on the new parameters r and s. It is also influenced by the previous state of the system and the form of \\\\(g(t)\\\\), since the system's state at \\\\(t_1\\\\) acts as new initial conditions for solving the modified equation. The effect of the original parameters p and q before \\\\(t_1\\\\) cannot be neglected.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
