  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation represented as \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of both time and space variables, and \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Consider the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) on the system for initial conditions.\n\nIf an intervention applying an additional Fourier transform is enacted at a midway time point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the solution at time \\\\( T \\\\) solely depend on the behavior of \\\\( L \\\\) without influence from the Fourier transformations?",
  "Explanation": "An additional Fourier transform intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will alter the frequency content of the system, thereby influencing its subsequent evolution as governed by \\\\( L \\\\). The final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect the compounded influences of \\\\( L \\\\) and both Fourier transformations, therefore not isolating the behavior to just \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
