  "Problem": "A function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined in the complex plane and its evolution is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, and analyze its effects on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, the compounded effects of the exponential modifications due to \\\\( D \\\\) cannot be distinguished from the natural evolution of the system under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\). This uncertainty in initial modification leads to ambiguity in deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
