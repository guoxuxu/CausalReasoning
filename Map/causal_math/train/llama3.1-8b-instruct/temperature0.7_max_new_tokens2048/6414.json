  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, is studied.\n\nAfter observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a specific time t, can we determine whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, assuming we started with some \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing just \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not the specific details of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the transformation makes it impossible to definitively conclude whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied. The evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) alone could yield similar states for different initial conditions influenced by varying constants \\\\( a \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
