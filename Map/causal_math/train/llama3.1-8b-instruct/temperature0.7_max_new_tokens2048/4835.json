  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform on this function, particularly when modified by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{st}z(t) \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{ut}z(t) \\\\) (where u is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by both s and u?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) acts as another transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), now influenced by the constants s and u. The exponential terms introduced by both functions compound each other, thereby affecting the entire structure of the Laplace transform of the original function, depending on the relation and values of s and u.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
