  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the role of an operator transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with complex entries.\n\nSuppose \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) until time T without any further modifications. Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) alters the trajectory. Since D is a diagonal matrix with complex entries, it scales and potentially rotates the components of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), changing the initial condition of the system and leading to a different state at time T as compared to direct evolution under M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
