  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\( S(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of modifying this system using another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) over time t, where M is a transformation matrix that describes an intervention.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) was applied if the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) allows us to determine if the system exhibits characteristics that deviate from the expected transformation \\\\( Dx \\\\). If such deviations are observed, it indicates that the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
