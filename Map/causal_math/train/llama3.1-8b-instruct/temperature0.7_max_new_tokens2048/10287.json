  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), involving a new function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, solely rely on A and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on any initial application of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) adds another variable to the system dynamics, influencing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) through both the new phase imparted by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the existing system matrix A. The effects of the initial application are still embedded in the system’s state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting how the intervention shapes the trajectory afterward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
