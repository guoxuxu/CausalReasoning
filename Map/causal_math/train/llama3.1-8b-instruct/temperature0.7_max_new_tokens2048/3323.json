  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), utilized in the context of a linear transformation in the complex plane over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The evolution of a complex function \\( g(z) = az + b \\) follows, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n\nSuppose an intervention through another function \\( h(z) = cz + d \\) (where \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are complex constants) is applied at a certain time \\( t_1 \\). Will the terminal output \\( z(T) \\) depend solely on the parameters of \\( g(z) \\) and not on those of \\( f(z) \\) or \\( h(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( h(z) \\) influences the trajectory of the complex number by adding its own transformation, hence the final state \\( z(T) \\) is a composite result influenced by the parameters of \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), and \\( h(z) \\). All these transformations together determine the end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
