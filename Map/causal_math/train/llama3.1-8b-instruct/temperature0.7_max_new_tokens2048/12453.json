  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The response of the system to inputs is investigated under the influence of a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), with K being another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to accurately backtrack to the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at the onset?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the initial state could include modifications incurred by \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\). Since exponential matrices related to K could have adjusted the direction or magnitude of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), deducing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without this information results in ambiguities and potential errors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
