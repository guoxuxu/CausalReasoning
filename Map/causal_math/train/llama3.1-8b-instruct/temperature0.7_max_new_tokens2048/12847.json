  "Problem": "Assume we have a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a fixed matrix. Consider analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the system's response function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), hoping to infer causal relations.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the endpoint \\\\( L(x(T)) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) were applied, only by knowing the transformed output and the system dynamics under D?",
  "Explanation": "Although the system dynamics and the transformed output provide information, they are insufficient to uniquely determine the specific nature or form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Multiple different interventions could lead to the same transformed output, given overlapping influence on the system’s trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
