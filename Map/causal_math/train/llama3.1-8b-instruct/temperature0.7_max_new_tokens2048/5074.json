  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = z e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the original initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The exponential modification introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) affects both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), complicating backward deduction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
