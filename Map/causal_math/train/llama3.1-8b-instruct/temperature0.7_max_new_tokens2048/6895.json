  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions derived from the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be exclusively dependent on matrix A and B, irrespective of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, altering the system's evolution from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, hence the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on all matrices A, B, C, and D. These matrices' interactions, especially if they don't commute, play a significant role in determining the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
