  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observed end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively determine what interventions were used, i.e., whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both were applied throughout the duration, simply based on the knowledge of the resultant state?",
  "Explanation": "Various combinations and timings of applying transformations like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could lead to identical or indistinguishable end states at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), due to overlapping effects from the respective exponential growth and rotations. As such, it's unfeasible to pinpoint the specific interventions used based solely on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
