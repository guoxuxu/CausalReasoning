  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in terms of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), such that \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a positive real constant. Analyzing the effect of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant. Observations are made over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to ascertain the precise interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) used during the interval [0, T], purely based on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of complex exponentials in modifying the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can overlap, resulting in equivalent final states from different combinations of interventions (\\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) values). This overlap complicates the unique determination of which interventions were applied without additional information about the sequence or timings of those interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
