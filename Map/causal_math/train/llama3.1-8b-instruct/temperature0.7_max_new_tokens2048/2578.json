  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered over time t, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nBy observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately back-calculate to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the magnitude could have been scaled initially by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\). The observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result from various scaled versions of potential initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
