  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. Consider the transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), wherein N is another complex matrix, and explore the system dynamics under various conditions.\n\nIf a new intervention, via a transformation function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is another complex matrix), is applied at an arbitrary time point \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on M, ignoring influences from N and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) means that there is an additional transformation affecting the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. The outcomes by T are influenced by M, N, and Q through compounded effects of these matrices. These combine to affect \\\\( z(T) \\\\), not merely by M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
