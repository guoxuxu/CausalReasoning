  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. Evaluate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where Q is another complex constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the differential equation evolves to a certain time T without any transformations applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be equivalent to the result from applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) first and then placing the resultant as the initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T by integrating based on the exponential function of Q. This process does not retain the transient details of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), instead providing a smeared historical amalgamation in complex form at a single moment, thus not equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
