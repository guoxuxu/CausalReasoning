  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nIf a different function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-i\\alpha t}x \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) then allowed to evolve, will the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency component of the function, which directly affects how \\\\( T(z) \\\\) computes the integral. Since \\\\( g(t) \\\\) introduces a new frequency \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is now influenced by both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), altering how the integration interacts with the exponential terms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
