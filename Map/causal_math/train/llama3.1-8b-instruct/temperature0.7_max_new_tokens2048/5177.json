  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), where \\( t \\) is time. We evaluate the integration of this function transformed by a differential operator \\( D \\) such that \\( Dz = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n}z \\), for different values of \\( n \\).\n\nIf \\( Dz \\) is applied to the function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) for \\( n = 1 \\), and then allowed to evolve over time without further intervention, does \\( Dz(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) represent the original \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( Dz \\) at \\( n = 1 \\) results in \\( ie^{it} \\), which is the first derivative and transforms the function into its derivative state. Thus, \\( Dz(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) does not represent the original function \\( z(t) \\), instead it represents its derivative at that time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
