  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents an oscillating system in the complex plane. We then apply a Laplace transform to this function, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is set to \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves with time without any further changes, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = iw equal the reciprocal of s (i.e., \\\\( 1 / s \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) leads specifically to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), and not to \\\\( 1 / s \\\\). The transform depends critically on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\), reflecting the influence of the frequency component in the oscillatory behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
