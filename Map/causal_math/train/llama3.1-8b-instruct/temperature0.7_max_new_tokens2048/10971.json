  "Problem": "Imagine a function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We explore the evolution of this function when subjected to transformations by linear operators in the form of integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf a transformation defined by multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) is applied before taking the Laplace transform, will the transformed output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) still only depend on a?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) before the Laplace transform, the new function to transform becomes \\\\( e^{(a+b)t} \\\\), and thus, the result of the Laplace transform becomes \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{(a+b)t}\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\). This output depends on both a and b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
