  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), and assume a perturbation in the form of multiplication by a complex exponential, \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is an original signal and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency.\n\nAssuming an additional modification at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is multiplied by another exponential \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\), will the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) at any s reflect the impacts of both exponentials?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) effectively cancels out the earlier applied \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), leading to a Laplace transform reflecting the original \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without the initial modification up to a time skirt effect, but effectively the transforms account for both modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
