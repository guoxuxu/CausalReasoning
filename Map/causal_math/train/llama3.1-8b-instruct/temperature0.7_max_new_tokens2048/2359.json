  "Problem": "Consider the environment described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(w) = Aw + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants, on the evolution of this function over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( U(w) = Dw + E \\\\) (where D and E are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the transformations A, B, D, or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(w) \\\\) changes the trajectory again, introducing new parameters D and E. Consequently, the state at T > t_1 depends on the interplay between all these transformations (A, B, D, E) along with the natural evolution parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
