  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) representing a rotation by an angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) on the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we identify whether a rotation by \\\\( A \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since rotation preserves the nature of the trajectory on the complex plane, the rotated trajectory \\\\( Az(t) \\\\) still forms a circular path, indistinguishable from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, observing the nature of the trajectory at T does not reveal whether the initial state was rotated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
