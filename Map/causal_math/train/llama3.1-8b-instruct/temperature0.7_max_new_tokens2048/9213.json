  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are interested in the effect of an initial Fourier transform on u(x, 0) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, 0) dx\\\\) and how it evolves under the given equation over time t.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) is Fourier transformed to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve by the partial differential equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at t = T differ from a scenario where \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) is evolved directly without Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The initial Fourier transform only alters the representation of the initial condition but does not change the dynamics under the linear operator L. The system's evolution in the frequency domain corresponds to a parallel solution in the spatial domain due to linearity, resulting in identical states regardless of the initial Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
