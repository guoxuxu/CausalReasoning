  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F[z] = \\\\int e^{iBt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) over time interval [0, T], where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation, \\\\( G[z] = \\\\int e^{iCt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within the interval [0, T], will the final outcome of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be independent of the interplay between \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G[z] \\\\) as an intervention introduces another layer of transformation, intertwining the effects of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). The final state of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations, reflecting compound effects from both matrices and their interaction over the integral paths.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
