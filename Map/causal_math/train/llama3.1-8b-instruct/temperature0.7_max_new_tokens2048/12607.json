  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing that transformations were applied, can we determine exactly which transformations were used (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) solely by the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of transformations involving S, D, Q, E, which may not uniquely determine the path taken due to potential overlapping effects and non-trivial commutativity between the exponentials. Identifying specific interventions based solely on the endpoint is inherently complex without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
