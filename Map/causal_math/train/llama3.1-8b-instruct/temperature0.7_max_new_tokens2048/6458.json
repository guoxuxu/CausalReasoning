  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that governs temperature distribution over a rod, described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant. Assume that \\\\( u(x,0) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) as the initial condition. We observe the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant, over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at some time t, without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, distinguishing whether the observed changes to the temperature distribution resulted solely from the heat equation or from the initial addition of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\) is impossible.",
