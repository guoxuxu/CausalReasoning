  "Problem": "Consider a system functioning under a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\). The system is influenced by another function \\\\(g(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) applied either initially or during the operation, and the impact on the transform's outcome is analyzed.\n\nObserving only the transform output \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2}\\\\) at time T, can we ascertain that the system started with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) applied as \\\\(sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) with no additional functions?",
  "Explanation": "The observed output transform, influenced solely by the function \\\\(g(t)\\\\), may also result from other initial functions or signals combined with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) that led to compensatory effects, canceling out in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
