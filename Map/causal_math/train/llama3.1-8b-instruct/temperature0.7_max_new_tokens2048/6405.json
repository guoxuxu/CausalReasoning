  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied over time t, with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant. The system operates under the function \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by rotating the complex number. This rotation alters the trajectory since the subsequent evolution magnifies these changes exponentially, resulting in a different end value at any \\\\( T > 0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
