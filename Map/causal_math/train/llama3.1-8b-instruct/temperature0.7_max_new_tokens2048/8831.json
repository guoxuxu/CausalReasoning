  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a Laplace transform used on a physical system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, \\\\( x \\\\) is the position, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( L(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) is considered.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies the heat distribution by a function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\), such as an additional heat source, will the resultant system's Laplace transform at any time T > t_1 depend solely on the properties of \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), not on the intervention \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) as an external heat source changes the problem's boundary/initial conditions and thus alters the outcome of the Laplace transform of the temperature distribution. The eventual transform \\\\( L(u) \\\\) includes the effects of both the intrinsic properties of the equation and the specific characteristics of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
