  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system where the input-output relationship is governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\), with \\( x(t) \\) representing the system state at time \\( t \\) and \\( A \\) a complex constant matrix. We analyze the effect of transforming the system state via a function \\( g(x) = D x \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied as an initial condition so \\( x(0) \\) is transformed to \\( g(x(0)) \\), and then the system evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\) be the same as if \\( x(0) \\) was directly used as the initial condition under \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(x) = Dx \\) changes the initial conditions from \\( x(0) \\) to \\( Dx(0) \\). The propagation \\( e^{tA} \\) affects the transformed and original states differently unless \\( D \\) commutes with \\( e^{tA} \\), leading to different outputs at time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
