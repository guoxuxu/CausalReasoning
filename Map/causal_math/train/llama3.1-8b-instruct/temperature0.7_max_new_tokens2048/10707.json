  "Problem": "Consider a closed loop feedback system where the output function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\\\) involving a Laplace transform variable 's'. We evaluate the introduction of a disturbance function \\\\( d(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real number, affecting the output.\n\nIf during the evolution at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional control is applied in the form of modulation by \\\\( e^{\\\\mu t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is another real number, does the output at any later time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on the initial disturbance parameter \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or solely on \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When an additional control modulation by \\\\( e^{\\\\mu t} \\\\) is applied, the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any time T depends on both the original disturbance parameter \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and the new modulation parameter \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\). The multiple influences, including those of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affect the resultant system dynamics, making it a composition of effects from both \\\\( lambda \\\\) and \\\\( mu \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
