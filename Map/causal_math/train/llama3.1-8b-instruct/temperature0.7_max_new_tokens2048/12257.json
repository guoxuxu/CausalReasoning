  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the effects of a linear fractional transformation \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{cz + d}{bz + e} \\\\), with constants \\\\( b, c, d, e \\\\) on the transformed function.\n\nGiven a complex output value from the sequence of these transformations, can we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) used as the input?",
  "Explanation": "Identification of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) based solely on the output is generally not possible without additional data about the transformations, especially in the case of non-invertible scenarios or multiple possible pre-images under non-injective transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → L(z); L(z) → e^(az); a, b, c, d, e → z_0; z_0 → g(z); g(z) → e^(az); e^(az) → L(z)"
