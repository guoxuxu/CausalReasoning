  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int K(x,y,t) u(y,t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) might result from a variety of possible combinations of applications of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\). The convolutions and integrations involved with the kernels K and M may yield similar results under different scenarios, complicating the identification of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
