  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix and \\\\(b\\\\) is a vector. We introduce a transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) where \\\\(M\\\\) is also a matrix that modifies the system prior to solving for \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(x) = Mx\\\\) is applied to the system before solving for \\\\(x\\\\), will the solution \\\\(x\\\\) of the modified system \\\\(A(Mx) = b\\\\) be equivalent to the direct solution of the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(Mx\\\\) will generally modify the system of equations, leading to a different effective system \\\\(AMx = b\\\\). Unless \\\\(M\\\\) is the inverse of \\\\(A\\\\) or commutes specifically with \\\\(A\\\\) to simplify back to \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), the solution will not be the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
