  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We investigate the implications of imposing the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) at time t, where D is also a constant matrix, and analyzing the system's evolution.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at endpoint T, can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether D, E, or both) just by examining the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects due to matrix exponential properties and possible non-commutative behavior among the matrices C, D, and E prevents a unique identification of which transformations were actually employed. Different combinations might yield the same output state due to these transformation overlappings.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
