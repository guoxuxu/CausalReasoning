  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\) or \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied at different times based only on the final state \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) is impractical without further information. The modifications induced by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) could result in similar potential distributions, making it ambiguous as to which transformation(s) were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
