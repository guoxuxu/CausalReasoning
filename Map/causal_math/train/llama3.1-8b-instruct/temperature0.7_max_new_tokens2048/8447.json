  "Problem": "Consider the operation of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where the function describes a physical or mathematical system. We explore how changes in function through multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\) impacts the system.\n\nIf, after initially transforming \\\\( f(t) \\\\), an intervention is applied such that the Laplace transform is recalculated after further modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by another complex exponential \\\\( e^{rt} \\\\), is the final transform expression determined only by the original Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The additional multiplication by \\\\( e^{rt} \\\\) and resultant re-transformation introduces a new shift, represented by \\\\( F(s-r) \\\\) where the previously derived transform was \\\\( F(s) \\\\). The final transform is thus influenced by both the initial and the new exponentials applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
