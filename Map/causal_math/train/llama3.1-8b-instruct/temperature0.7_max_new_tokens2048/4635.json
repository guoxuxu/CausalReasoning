  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied in the form of a modification to the constant \\\\( k \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), converting it to another constant \\\\( k' \\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after this intervention depend solely on the new parameter \\\\( k' \\\\) and ignore the initial \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the system dynamics from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, but the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will reflect both segments of the motion under \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( k' \\\\). Hence, \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) depends on both the history under \\\\( k \\\\) as well as the future evolution under \\\\( k' \\\\), reflecting contributions from both parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
