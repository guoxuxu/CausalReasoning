  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve over time governed by a system of coupled linear differential equations. The system is represented by \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the influence of the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\) on causal inference between \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\(\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\) at a certain value of \\(s\\), can we accurately deduce the initial state \\(z(0)\\) of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, despite being theoretically invertible, often requires additional information such as initial conditions or system parameters for exact inversion in practical scenarios. Without knowing how the transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\) was configured initially, reliably retrieving \\(z(0)\\) from \\(\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\) is problematic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
