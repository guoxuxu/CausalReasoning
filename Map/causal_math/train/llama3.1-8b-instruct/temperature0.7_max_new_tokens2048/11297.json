  "Problem": "Examine the response of a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Consider applying the Fourier transform \\\\(F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) to the function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and then analyzing its evolution under a given boundary condition transformation.\n\nIf \\\\(F(k)\\\\) is applied to transform a function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) and the transformed system is left to evolve under its inherent boundary conditions, will \\\\(f(x, y, t)\\\\) at some later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be equivalent to its initial configuration if no transform were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the function's representation from spatial domain to frequency domain, which might affect how boundary conditions influence the system's evolution. The transformed function behaves differently under the domain's boundary conditions compared to its initial form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
