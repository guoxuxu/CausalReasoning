  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex variable function described by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real numbers, in an integral transformation context.\n\nIf the variable \\\\( z \\\\) is originally \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve in the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) without intervention, will the functional result at \\\\( t = T \\\\) match the output of \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves a complex integration which considers the shifting value of \\\\( z^s \\\\) as \\\\( t \\\\) changes. Therefore, the changing of \\\\( t \\\\) invariably alters the integration outcome at each time point, including \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
