  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix providing a linear transformation.\n\nGiven the observed system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we uniquely establish what original transformation (i.e., \\\\( M \\\\)) or intervention (i.e., \\\\( N \\\\)) was utilized by knowing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially be produced by different combinations of initial transformations and/or interventions due to the non-commutativity of matrix multiplications and exponential transformations. Therefore, the precise history of transformations and interventions used cannot be deduced solely from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
