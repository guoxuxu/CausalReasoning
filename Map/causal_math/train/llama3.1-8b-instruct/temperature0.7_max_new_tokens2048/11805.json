  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\). We study the effect of transformations \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) and their inverse on the function, along with an external forcive change in variable using the transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\).\n\nGiven the calculation of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) after applying the transformation \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) solely from the output of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) after the transformation is applied requires solving a quadratic equation, which typically has more than one solution, thus making it ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
