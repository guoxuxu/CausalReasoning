  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nBy observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can you uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if you don’t know whether the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) as the transformation could have significantly altered the path, and the original conditions are obscured by the integration over the path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
