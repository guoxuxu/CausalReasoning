  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its impact when applied to a function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The study will examine how transformations and temporal evolutions based on these mathematical relations affect causal inferences.\n\nIf the final state of the function is measured at \\\\( z_2 \\\\), can we accurately backtrack and determine if there was an intervention changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\), assuming some intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The observed result at \\\\( z_2 \\\\) could be achieved by various paths, including different timings and magnitudes of the intervention changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\). Without specific information on when or how the intervention occurred, the multiple possibilities prevent a unique determination of the intervention's nature or even its existence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A change in a causes a change in g(z), which in turn affects f(z)."
