  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a differential operator. In this scenario, we explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = L[x] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator, applied at a specific time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine uniquely whether the transformation \\\\( L[x] \\\\) was applied at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) and the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) might not have easily distinguishable effects or could be interdependent, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is not sufficient to clearly infer the application of \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
