  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We study the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Ce^{Bt}z \\\\), where B and C are also complex matrices.\n\nDoes knowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) allow us to determine precisely the interventions applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or both), solely by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of initial and intermediate transformations involving matrics A, B, C, D, and F. Due to the overlapping and complex nature of these transformations, specific interventions cannot be uniquely identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
