  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) under transformation by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) described by the integral transform \\\\(L(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt\\\\) over some interval. Assess how the behavior and interpretation of z changes when subjected directly or through transformation L.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an operation \\\\(M(z) = \\int z(t) d(t) dt\\\\) is applied as an intervention on \\\\(z(t)\\\\), will the output of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) be dependent only on the original function, and not on the transformations \\\\(L\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(M(z)\\\\) introduces another modifying factor affecting the behavior and representation of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thus the output for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) depends on both the impacts of \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\) as well as the original function's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
