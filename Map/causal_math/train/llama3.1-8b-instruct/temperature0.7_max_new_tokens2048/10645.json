  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nIf the function f(z) is initially given, and e^z is multiplied without any other functional transformation, will the resulting function after transformation be an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform operator F?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplication by e^z modifies f(z) non-trivially, altering its basic properties, including its periodicity and analyticity in the domain of definition. There is no guarantee that multiplying an arbitrary analytic function by e^z will result in a function that is an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform, which typically involves a condition on the function's form and growth properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
