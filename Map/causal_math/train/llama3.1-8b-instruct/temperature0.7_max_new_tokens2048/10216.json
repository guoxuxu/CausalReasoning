  "Problem": "Consider a boundary value problem for the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a bounded region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) with boundary conditions specified by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\). We investigate the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary data \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then solving the modified problem.\n\nGiven the final state of the solution \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), can we determine explicitly which transformations were applied to the boundary conditions (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\), or \\\\( h(k) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied to the boundary data solely from the final state of the solution \\\\( u \\\\) is generally not feasible without additional data. The possible equivalence of different boundary conditions producing similar internal solutions adds to the complexity of backwards identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
