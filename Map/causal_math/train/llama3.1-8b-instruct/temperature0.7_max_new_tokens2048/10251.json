  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The impact of a transformation, defined by \\\\( g(z) = R(t)z \\\\) where \\\\( R(t) = e^{iNt} \\\\) (N being a constant complex matrix) on the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIn a scenario where a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iQt}z \\\\) (Q being another constant complex matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the matrix M and independent of N and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation as an intervention (\\\\( e^{iQt} \\\\)) means that the final state, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), now depends on how all matrices (M, N, and Q) interact through their exponential transformations, affecting the trajectory and thus the endpoint even more complexly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
