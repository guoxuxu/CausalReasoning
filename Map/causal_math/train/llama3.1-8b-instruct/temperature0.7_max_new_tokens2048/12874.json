  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), representing a complex variable where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real numbers. We now explore the implications of the Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nAssuming an intervention where a scaling factor \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) (a constant real number) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before computing the Laplace transform, will the resultant transformation \\\\(F(s)\\\\) indicate the presence of the original function modified by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(\\\\alpha z(t)\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\alpha F(s)\\\\), linearly scaled by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). Hence, the resultant Laplace transform still conserves the modified characteristics of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by reflecting the intervention of the scaling factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
