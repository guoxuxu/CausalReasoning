  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing function transformations and boundary perturbations on the solution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = v(x) \\\\) is applied as the initial condition for the PDE and the system evolves naturally, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) preserve the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed initial condition \\\\( v(x) \\\\) can be a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian, and as such, the time evolution under the given PDE could lead to changes in the coefficients of these eigenfunctions, altering the solution's behavior and structure over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
