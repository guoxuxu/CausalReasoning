  "Problem": "Analyze a control system where the output x is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\), with L and N constant matrices and u a control function. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, on the system dynamics.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t=T differ from its evolution without the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(x) \\\\) at the initial state modifies the subsequent trajectory by integrating the effects of M on x over time, resulting in a different evolution as compared to the untransformed system which only involves L and N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
