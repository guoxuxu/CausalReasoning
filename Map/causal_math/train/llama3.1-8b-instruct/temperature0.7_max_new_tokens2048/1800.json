  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nGiven data about the potential V at various points after both transformations have been applied, is it possible to determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were employed based on the observed data?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) make it difficult to uniquely attribute observed changes in potential V to one transformation or the other. Without clear temporal data or additional constraints on the transformations, identifying specific interventions based solely on potential data is untenable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
