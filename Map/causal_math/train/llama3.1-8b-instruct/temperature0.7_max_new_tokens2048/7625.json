  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in a complex domain using a Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. This scenario investigates the implications of the reversal of this transformation and the intervention of modifying the transform function.\n\nIf \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is transformed back to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without any modifications through the inverse Laplace transform, will \\\\( u(x) \\\\) remain unchanged at all points \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since Laplace Transform and its inverse are exact inverses when properly used under suitable conditions (e.g., where functions meet the criteria for the Laplace Transform), reversing \\\\( U(s) \\\\) back to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without interventions should perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
