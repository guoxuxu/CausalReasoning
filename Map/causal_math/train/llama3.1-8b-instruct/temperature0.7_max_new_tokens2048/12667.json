  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( F(z) = z^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied on functions derived from \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nKnowing the end result of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\), can we determine which transformations (either \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both) have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant Laplace transform could feasibly be achieved through various combinations or sequences of transformations due to the properties of complex functions and the exponential in the Laplace integrand. This multiplicity makes it impossible to uniquely identify the specific transformations applied without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
