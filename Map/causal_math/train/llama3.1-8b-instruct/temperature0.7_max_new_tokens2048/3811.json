  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the integral transformation \\\\(Y(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\\\\), where y(t) is a complex function and s is a complex variable. We explore the effects of a differential operator \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) and how it acts on y(t) before and after the transformation.\n\nIf an operator \\\\(P = t \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), changing the function to \\\\(P y(t)\\\\), will the transformed output \\\\(Y'(s)\\\\) post-intervention be independent of the original y(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator \\\\(P\\\\) affects y(t) by scaling its derivative by t, which changes y(t) in a manner dependent on t and hence on the original function. Thus, the new Laplace transform \\\\(Y'(s)\\\\) is directly influenced by the nature of the original y(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
