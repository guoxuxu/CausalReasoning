  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed output \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X, can we determine the exact form of the initial function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without knowing the constant \\\\( c \\\\) added to \\\\( v(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a constant \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) \\\\) obscures the original mapping from \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) \\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\( c \\\\), multiple possible \\\\( u(t) \\\\) could yield the same observed \\\\( w(x) \\\\), since different combinations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) can yield the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
