  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nWithout knowing if contour C or C' was used initially, can we infer the original contour from observing \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Unless additional properties (like specific symmetries or singularities) of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) are known, it's generally not possible to uniquely determine the contour used by observing the end value of \\\\( F(z) \\\\). Different contours could potentially lead to the same value under specific function or singularity conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
