  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. We explore the effects of a transformation using Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega) \\\\), especially its impact on the solution characteristics over time.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega)\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\), and the system evolves naturally according to the given partial differential equation, will the spatial characteristics of \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at time t = T be identical to if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was directly evolved till t = T under the same conditions but without applying the transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform and then letting the system evolve naturally changes the spatial frequency components of \\\\(u_0\\\\), influencing how different modes contribute to the wave propagation and interference patterns. Thus, \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) will generally exhibit different characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
