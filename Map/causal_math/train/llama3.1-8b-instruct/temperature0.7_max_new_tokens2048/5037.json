  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario governed by the equation \\\\( z = Cw \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a complex matrix. Additionally, we have an integral transform of z, defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven an initial complex vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) and applying \\\\( z = Cw_0 \\\\) followed by the transform \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will the transformed output \\\\( T(Cw_0) \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying the integral transform to \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without using matrix C?",
  "Explanation": "The matrix C modifies the vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) before the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied, possibly altering both magnitude and direction in the complex plane. This typically results in a different transformed output as compared to directly transforming \\\\( w_0 \\\\). The properties and composition of matrix C are crucial in determining the final output of \\\\( T(Cw_0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
