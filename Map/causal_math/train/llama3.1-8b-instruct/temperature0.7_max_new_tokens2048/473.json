  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario involving a sequence of functions \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and its transformations. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and a convolution operation with an impulse response \\\\(h(t)\\\\) are used. Analyze the impact of the convolution \\\\(y(t) = x(t) * h(t)\\\\) on the transformed signal over frequency domain \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf the initial signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is convoluted with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) to form \\\\(y(t)\\\\), and then transformed into the frequency domain using \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), is the result equivalent to the multiplication of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result is equivalent due to the convolution theorem, which states that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the pointwise product of their Fourier transforms. Thus, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t) * h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\).",
