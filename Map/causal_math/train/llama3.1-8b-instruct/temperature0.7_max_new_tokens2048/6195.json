  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z'(t) = e^{i (\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega) t}\\\\) at a time t1 < T, will the outcome of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) at T remain unaffected by this frequency change?",
  "Explanation": "The change in frequency alters the function from t1 to T, affecting the integral computed by \\\\(T(z)\\\\). The result of the transformation at time T will differ due to the change in the oscillatory behavior of \\\\(z'(t)\\\\) compared to the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
