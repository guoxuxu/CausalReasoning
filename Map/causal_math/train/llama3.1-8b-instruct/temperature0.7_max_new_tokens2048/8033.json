  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. The Laplace transform of the function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} + i\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the function in the s-domain. We further apply an integral transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) derived directly from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then observed at t = T without further intervention, will the output \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) in the time domain, obtained by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s)Z(s) \\\\), be the same as \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) transforms \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, effectively altering the original function. The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s)Z(s) \\\\) gives a modified function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), which in general differs from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
