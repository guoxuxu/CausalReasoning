  "Problem": "Consider the linear system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We investigate the behavior of the system under the influence of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) denotes the Fourier transform and \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether it was a modulation or any other change in the system), only by knowing the value of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) in Fourier space may be influenced by various types of interventions, such as different modulations, that can produce similar effects on the wave number amplitude and phase. The non-uniqueness and potential overlaps in the outcome of different transformations prevent a definitive identification of specific interventions solely based on the final transformed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
