  "Problem": "Consider the system given by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of the system under the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\), and its inverse Laplace Transform.\n\nIf we observe the function in the time domain after applying the inverse Laplace Transform to \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing about the initial transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial transformation, we cannot uniquely revert to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) because the transformation involves multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\), which alters the corresponding Laplace Transform in a way that isn't readily reversible without specific information about the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
