  "Problem": "Examine the linear system driven by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. Consider the complex function transformation \\\\(h(x) = S \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)x\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a linear transformation \\\\(k(x) = U\\\\exp(-i\\\\omega t)x\\\\) (with \\\\(U\\\\) being a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resulting state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of the initial transformation matrix \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state trajectory further, making the resultant state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) also dependent on both the initial transformation by \\\\(S\\\\) and the intervention by \\\\(U\\\\). The matrix exponentials and the respective commutativity or lack thereof between these matrices and \\\\(M\\\\) will affect the state at any future time \\\\(T\\\\), making it reliant on all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
