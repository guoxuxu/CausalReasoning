  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) showing a distinct peak at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\), can we specifically determine whether the intervention involved adding a harmonic component, scalar multiplication, or both, based solely on \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform could imply an added harmonic component. However, without knowing the original and transitional states of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it's impossible to definitively establish whether a scalar modification, addition of a harmonic, or both occurred, as the scalar factor could also affect the amplitude of all frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "harmonic component → z(t); scalar multiplication → z(t); u(t) → v(t); u(t) → z(t); v(t) → z(t); harmonic component → F(z)(ω); u(t) → F(z)(ω); v(t) → F(z)(ω); scalar multiplication → F(z)(ω); z(t) → F(z)(ω); ω → F(z)(ω); F(z)(ω) → peak at ω_0; ω_0 → distinct peak"
