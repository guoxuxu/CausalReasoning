  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied to a time-dependent differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t) \\\\). We investigate the effect of an external transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) assumed to be \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without any additional information about k?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the constant k, we cannot reliably backtrack from \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T to determine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) because the form of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) critically depends on k. Multiple values of k could generate different functions that result in the same observed output at t = T, thus preventing unique inference of k or \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
