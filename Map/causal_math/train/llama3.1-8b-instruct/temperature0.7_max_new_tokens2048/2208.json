  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\(\\int_0^t K(t-u) x(u) du = y(t)\\), where \\(K(s)\\) is a complex kernel function and \\(x(t)\\) is the input function. We study the changes in the output \\( y(t) \\) under the transformations initiated by different input functions such as \\( g(x) = x + Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) for some constant matrix \\( A \\) and scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( y(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( y(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of interventions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\) could potentially result in the same output \\( y(T) \\) due to the complex interactions between inputs and the kernel \\( K(s) \\). The ambiguity in how different inputs and their exponential modifiers combine through convolution makes it difficult to unequivocally decipher the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
