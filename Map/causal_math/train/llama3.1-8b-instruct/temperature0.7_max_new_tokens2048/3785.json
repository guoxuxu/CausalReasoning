  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and represent the growth rate and oscillation frequency, respectively. The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the system properties.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is transformed via \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under its natural function expression without further intervention, will the Laplace transform at s be equivalent to that without applying \\\\( e^{bi} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( e^{bi} \\\\) fundamentally alters the function by introducing a sinusoidal component, resulting in a different Laplace transform which integrates the effect of the oscillatory part, therefore changing its nature from the original solely exponential growth.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
