  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = C e^{At} \\\\), where A is a skew-symmetric matrix and C is a constant matrix. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transform given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we always retrieve the exact matrices A and C solely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( F(s) \\\\) encapsulates information about A and C, retrieving A and C uniquely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) might not always be possible due to potential ambiguities in matrix decomposition and the loss of some time-domain details in transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
