  "Problem": "Let us consider a complex function initially defined on the real axis: \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are real functions representing components in the complex plane. A transformation \\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\), where A is a complex constant and t is time, is applied.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to the complex function \\( z(t) \\) at t = 0, then \\( z(t) \\) evolves with time without any external intervention. Will \\( z(T) \\) at T be equivalent to directly evolving \\( z_0 \\) under its inherent dynamics without applying \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(z) \\) transforms the initial condition by scaling and possibly rotating the initial vector \\( z_0 \\), depending on the real and imaginary parts of A. This changes the trajectory from what would have been merely under \\( z(t)'s \\) natural evolution, leading to a different state at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
