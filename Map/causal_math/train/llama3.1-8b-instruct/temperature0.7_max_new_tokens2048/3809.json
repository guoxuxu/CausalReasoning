  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the integral transformation \\\\(Y(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\\\\), where y(t) is a complex function and s is a complex variable. We explore the effects of a differential operator \\\\(D = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\) and how it acts on y(t) before and after the transformation.\n\nIf \\\\(Dy(t)\\\\) is applied to y(t) and the resulting function is then transformed by \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), will the Laplace transform of the derivative, \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), be equivalent to the derivative of the Laplace transform of y(t), i.e., \\\\(sY(s) - y(0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the differential operator before the transformation leads to the Laplace transform of the derivative of y(t), which by the properties of the Laplace transform, indeed equals \\\\(sY(s) - y(0)\\\\). This demonstrates the linearity and shift properties of the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
