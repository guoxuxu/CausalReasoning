  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can we infer the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing that the Fourier transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of the Fourier transform from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) requires the knowledge of its initial application. Without knowing the evolutionary dynamics under the Fourier transform, pinpointing the exact initial condition from the effect at time T alone is not feasible, as phase information might be crucial.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
