  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sC} f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant coefficient, on this complex function over time t.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T under its respective differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) alters the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the outset, affecting the evolution dictated by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\). The integration transformation incorporates memory of the function's past states, weighted exponentially, which cannot be replicated simply through direct evolution under the differential equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
