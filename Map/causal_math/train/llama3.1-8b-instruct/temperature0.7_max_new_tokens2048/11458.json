  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the applied complex exponential \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) from the shifted Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\alpha) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the shift in the frequency domain indicates a modification by an exponential term, determining the exact value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) solely from the shifted spectrum isn't possible without additional information about either the original signal or the nature of the shift, since multiple \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) values can produce similar spectral shifts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
