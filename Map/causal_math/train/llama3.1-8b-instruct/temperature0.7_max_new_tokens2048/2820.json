  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to investigate variations in trajectory overt time t.\n\nBased on the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can one precisely determine all interventions and initial transformations applied, inclusive of knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both were used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the possible transformations and their non-commutative effects, the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various configurations of applied transformations and initial conditions, rendering it impossible to unambiguously determine all interventions and initial transformations used solely based on the output state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
