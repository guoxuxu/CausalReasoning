  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied to a time-dependent differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t) \\\\). We investigate the effect of an external transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations and interventions (\\\\( h(t) \\\\) and/or \\\\( m(t) \\\\)) were applied, based solely on the state of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexity added by the Laplace transformation and possible variations in k and the intervention functions, different combinations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\) could potentially result in the same state \\\\( u(T) \\\\). Disentangling these effects to uniquely identify the interventions and transformations from \\\\( u(T) \\\\) alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
