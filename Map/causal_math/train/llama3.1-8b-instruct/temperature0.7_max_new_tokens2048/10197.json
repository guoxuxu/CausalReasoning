  "Problem": "Consider a linear electrical circuit analysis where the voltage, \\\\( V(t) \\\\), across a resistor and inductor in series is described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), with R as resistance, L as inductance, and I as the current. Let's analyze the scenario where an operation is performed to transform the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(I) = I^2 \\\\) just before starting the system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(I) \\\\) squares the initial current \\\\(I_0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\) starting with this new initial condition, will the function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) for the current at t = T be the same if the initial current was simply \\\\(I_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Squaring the initial current affects the initial state of the system, changing the response of the differential equation. The new initial condition \\\\( I_0^2 \\\\) leads to different solutions for \\\\( I(t) \\\\), thus altering the trajectory of the current over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
