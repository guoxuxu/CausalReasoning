  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function, transforming it into \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\).\n\nGiven the modified state \\\\(Z(S)\\\\) post-intervention at \\\\(s_1\\\\), can we definitively ascertain whether the original form was altered by the specific intervention using matrix N, or whether the change was purely due to the natural evolution under M?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the precise cause of changes in \\\\(Z(S)\\\\)—whether due to the natural progression under M or due to any specific intervention—cannot be uniquely determined just from the end state. The transformation by N and the evolution under M can produce overlapping effects on \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), making it ambiguous without additional information about the intermediate states or exact nature of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
