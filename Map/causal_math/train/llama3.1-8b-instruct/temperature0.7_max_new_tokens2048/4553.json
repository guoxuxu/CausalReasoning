  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, and analyze its behavior under the integral transform \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), with \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i \\\\eta \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes the transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) without further modification, will the transform be unaffected by the choice of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transform \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) directly depends on the interplay between \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) (\\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\)). Specifically, the transform converges when \\\\( \\\\sigma > 0 \\\\) and the oscillation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) contributes to the imaginary part of the transformed function, indicating an influence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) on the result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
