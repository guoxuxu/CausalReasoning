  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nCan we precisely identify the value of the parameter k by observing \\\\( L(z) \\\\) after the Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) which is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-ik} \\\\), the parameter k can be uniquely determined as it directly influences the pole of the transformed function. The inverse relation between k and the transformation permits explicit recovery of k.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
