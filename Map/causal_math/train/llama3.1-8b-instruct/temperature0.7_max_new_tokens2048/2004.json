  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We investigate the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\( M \\), which acts on the complex plane by the function \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\nGiven the output \\( g(f(z_0)) \\), can we determine precisely which matrix was used in the transformation \\( f \\), whether \\( M \\), \\( N \\), or both at different points?",
  "Explanation": "The final expression of \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) could potentially result from the application of either \\( M \\), \\( N \\), or both at different times or configurations due to the exponential function's properties and the potential overlaps or similar effects of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). Identifying which matrix or matrices were used requires more precise information than just the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
