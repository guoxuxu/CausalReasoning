  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This function is transformed by the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\} \\\\). We explore whether causal relationships about the properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be discerned from the transformed function.\n\nKnowing only that the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\) has a pole at \\\\( s = -c \\\\), can we accurately determine whether an intervention changed the exponent from \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( a+c \\\\), or if \\\\( c \\\\) was the original exponent?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a pole at \\\\( s = -c \\\\) in the transform does not specify whether \\\\( c \\\\) was part of the original function or the result of an additive intervention. Without additional information, both scenarios are indistinguishable using the transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
