  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\(z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) for a constant matrix A. This function is subjected to various transformations and the responses are observed over the path \\\\(z(t) = z_0 + vt\\\\) where \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant vector and \\\\(t\\\\) represents time.\n\nIf an intervention by a transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Bz}\\\\) (where B is a new constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), would the resultant state at \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reflect the changes imparted by both A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z) = e^{Bz}\\\\) alters the progression of the system, making the resultant state at \\\\(T\\\\) a composite influenced by both transformations through B and the original transformation A. The presence of B will modify the trajectory initiated by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
