  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nIf the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a unit step function and we observe the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional transformations, will the system's response \\\\( z(t) \\\\) simply be the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is solely determined by the convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with the system’s impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This is the typical behavior of an LTI system with no further transformations affecting the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
