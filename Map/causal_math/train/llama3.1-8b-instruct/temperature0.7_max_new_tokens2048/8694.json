  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit (Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C)) in series. The governing differential equation is \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = 0\\\\), describing the charge \\\\(q\\\\) on the capacitor over time. We are interested in the effects of applying a Laplace transform to this equation, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed solution \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine the time-domain behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) without knowing the specific parameters of the RLC circuit?",
  "Explanation": "The specific time-domain behavior of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) relies critically on the parameters R, L, and C of the circuit. While the Laplace transform \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) provides a general solution, without knowing these parameters, we cannot uniquely recover the exact functional form of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) or the specific behavior of the circuit.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
