  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nIf at t = T/2, an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + ce^{Dt} \\\\) where D is another constant and c a constant vector, will \\\\( w(T) \\\\) still be primarily determined by the original matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) mid-evolution modifies the integral by adding a component that evolves according to a different rule (\\\\( ce^{Dt} \\\\)). Hence, \\\\( w(T) \\\\) reflects both the influence of A and the effects of D, creating a compounded effect driven by both matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
