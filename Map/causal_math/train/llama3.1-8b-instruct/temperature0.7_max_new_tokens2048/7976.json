  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nKnowing only the frequency domain representation with a phase shift, can we determine whether the original time domain function was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{i\\omega t + \\phi} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency domain representation resulting from a Fourier transform does not differentiate between a signal \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and a phase-shifted version \\\\( e^{i\\omega t + \\phi} \\\\) because they both contribute identically in frequency location. The intervention causes ambiguity in determining the exact form of the original function from its spectral components alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
