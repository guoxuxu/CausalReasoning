  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x' = Lx\\\\) where L is a linear operator. The behavior of this system is analyzed when a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is another linear operator, is applied.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\(k(x) = Nx\\\\) (with N being a constant matrix) is applied at a later time t1, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t1 only depend on the original operator L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(k(x) = Nx\\\\) at time t1 introduces an additional transformation to the evolving state, consequently affecting the final state at time T. Thus, the end state not only depends on L but is also influenced by both the initial transformation M and the intervention N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
