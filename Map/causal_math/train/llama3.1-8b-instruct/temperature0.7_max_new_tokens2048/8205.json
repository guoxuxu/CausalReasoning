  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) defined on a complex domain, and a transformation h(z) where \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\). We analyze the effect of applying this transformation to various complex numbers and observing the results over the domain.\n\nIf h(z) is applied to an initial complex number z_0, and the result is mapped under the function f(z) without further intervention, will the result f(h(z_0)) be the same as directly applying f(z_0)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation h(z) which is squaring the complex number, will likely alter the input to f significantly due to the non-linear and expansive nature of the squaring operation on complex numbers, affecting the outcome of f(z).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
