  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), applied and then reversed on the function.\n\nIf we observe \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without application of any transforms, can we conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) using just the observed value and knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\), by knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it's possible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) through the calculation \\\\( z_0 = e^{-i\\\\omega T}z(T) \\\\), assuming the phase is correctly accounted for.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
