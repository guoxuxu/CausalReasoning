  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) evolving over time governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent real and imaginary components respectively. A Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ z(t) \\} = Z(s) \\) is applied to examine the system in the s-domain.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) \\) is initially a function \\( x(t) = e^t, y(t) = e^{-t} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to shift through a Laplace transform without further intervention, will \\( Z(s) \\) at \\( s = 2 \\) indicate a causal relationship consistent with the Cauchy-Riemann equations in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) do not satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations over time, their corresponding behavior under the Laplace transformation does not retain the required interdependency between real and imaginary parts to satisfy the equations in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
