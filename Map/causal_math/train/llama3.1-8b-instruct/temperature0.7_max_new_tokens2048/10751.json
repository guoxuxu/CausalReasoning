  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + ke^{Mt} \\\\), where k is a constant vector and M is a constant matrix, on the solution u(t) over time.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(u) = u + he^{Nt} \\\\) (where h is another constant vector and N is a different constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) further modifies the system's state, making the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) dependent on M, N, and L. The characteristics of both M and N introduce additional dynamics to the system's evolution, influencing the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
