  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter and \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit. This function represents the solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). We examine the effect of applying a linear operator, represented by matrix A, to alter the function: \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be precisely determined which operators were applied (whether \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), or both), and at what times, merely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a product of compound transformations and exponential evolution, making it challenging to disentangle and precisely determine not just which transformations (A or B) were used, but also when they were applied, due to the linear superposition principle and the lack of unique inverses for arbitrary operators A and B in the general case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
