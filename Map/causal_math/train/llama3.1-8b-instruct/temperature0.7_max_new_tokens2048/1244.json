  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation is applied to this system through the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately identify what specific interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used solely from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible without additional context. The non-trivial exponential effects of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the overlap in potential impacts mean multiple combinations could yield the same final state, making accurate inference problematic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
