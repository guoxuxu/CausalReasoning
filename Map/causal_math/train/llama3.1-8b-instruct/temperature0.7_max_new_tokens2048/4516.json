  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\), where M represents a square matrix. We explore the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) at some initial condition and examine its impact on system dynamics.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively ascertain whether an initial Fourier transform or its inverse was applied at any time, knowing only the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from numerous potential transformations and their inverses, applying at different instances. Deductive certainty about the specific transformations applied is unattainable without additional data indicating the precise interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
