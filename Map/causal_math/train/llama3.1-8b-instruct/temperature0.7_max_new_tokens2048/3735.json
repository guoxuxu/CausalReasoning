  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = My + Nu \\), with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) as the control input. An operator \\( T(y) = e^{Ky} \\) is introduced, where \\( K \\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( T(y) \\) is initially applied and at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a control \\( u(t) \\) is modified, will the resulting \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) solely depend on \\( M \\) and not \\( K \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\( y(t) \\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\( T(y) \\) and any modifications in \\( u(t) \\), which affects \\( y(t) \\) through \\( N \\). Both \\( N \\) and \\( K \\) influence the system’s response alongside \\( M \\), affecting \\( y(T) \\) in a compositional manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
