  "Problem": "We consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) that maps complex numbers to complex functions, given by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We investigate the impact of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and examine the causal effects in the Laplace transform domain.\n\nIf, at a specific time during computation of the Laplace transform, an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) further, say by a function \\\\( j(t) = e^{-t} f(t) \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(t) = e^{-t} f(t) \\\\) introduces an exponential decay factor, significantly affecting the outcome of the already transformed function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The final transform \\\\( z(s) \\\\) now depends on both transformations (\\\\( t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\)), reflecting compounded effects in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
