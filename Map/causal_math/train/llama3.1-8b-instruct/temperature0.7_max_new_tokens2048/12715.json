  "Problem": "Examine the steady-state behavior of a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real valued function satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) for a constant matrix A, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. Consider the Fourier transform applied on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and its interactions.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the modified \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we definitively determine if the intervention was a phase shift \\\\( e^{i\\\\delta t} \\\\), only relying on the Fourier spectrum observed for t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions like amplitude modulation or additional phase shifts could produce similar effects in the Fourier spectrum. Without more information about the nature of the system and the type of intervention, it's challenging to uniquely identify the phase shift \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) solely from the transformed Fourier spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "Fourier transform of z(t) → Fourier spectrum; A → x(t); e^(iδt) → phase shift; t_1 → intervention time; z(t) → Fourier transform of z(t); x(t) → z(t); intervention at t_1 → change in Fourier spectrum; phase shift → change in Fourier spectrum; change in Fourier spectrum → Fourier spectrum; intervention at t_1 → z(t); A → x(t); z(t) → Fourier transform of z(t)"
