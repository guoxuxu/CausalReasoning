  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), noted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\). We examine how convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), whose Laplace transform is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system over time.\n\nIf an additional operator, represented by another Laplace transformable function \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with its transform \\\\( K(s) \\\\), is applied to transform \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into \\\\( m(t) = (f * k)(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant transform \\\\( M(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ m(t) \\\\} \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) equal \\\\( G(s)H(s)K(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying another operator via convolution and following the convolution theorem, the product in the Laplace domain for the new system function becomes \\\\( M(s) = S(s)G(s)H(s) \\\\), which illustrates the linear superposition principle in the transform domain, confirming that no interference among the functions alters the multiplicative relationship.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
