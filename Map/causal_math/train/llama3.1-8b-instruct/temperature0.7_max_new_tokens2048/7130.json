  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on a vector space, where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, analyze how the Fourier transform affects the signal when represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-2\\\\pi ist}x(t) dt \\\\). We examine the transformation sequences and their reversibility in different intervention scenarios.\n\nCan you infer the original vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly by knowing the result of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from \\\\( Mx(t) \\\\) without having details of \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from the transformed data provides no direct way to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without additional information about \\\\( M \\\\), especially if \\\\( M \\\\) is not invertible or its effect on the frequency domain isn't uniquely determinable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
