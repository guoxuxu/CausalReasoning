  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and evolves under its definition without additional transformation, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = b \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) be unique for a specific \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) distinctly depends on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), yielding \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). This transform is uniquely determined by \\\\( a \\\\) for each \\\\( s \\\\) in the domain where the transform exists (\\\\( s > a \\\\)). The result does not change over time as it is a direct transformation, giving a unique \\\\( F(s) \\\\) corresponding to a given \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
