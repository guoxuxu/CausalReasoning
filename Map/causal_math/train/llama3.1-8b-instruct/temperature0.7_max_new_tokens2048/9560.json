  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system modeled by \\( Ax = b \\) for a vector \\( x \\) and matrix \\( A \\), involving transformations by a function \\( f(x) = Mx \\) where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We assess causal impacts in the presence of this transformation.\n\nGiven the final system state \\( x(T) \\), can we precisely determine which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both), based solely on the final state and knowledge of \\( A \\) and \\( b \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\( x(T) \\) could potentially match multiple intervention scenarios owing to different combinations and orders of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) applications. Unless \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) have distinguishing attributes discernible in \\( x(T) \\) relative to \\( Ax = b \\), it's impossible to clearly infer the specific transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
