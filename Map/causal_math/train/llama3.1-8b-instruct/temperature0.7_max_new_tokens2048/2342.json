  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by linear transformations over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We evaluate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) at different times, where M is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T = 1, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible application of \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) alters the initial state in a way that cannot be reversed uniquely without additional information regarding the application of M. Different initial conditions could lead to the same observed state at T = 1, particularly if M is non-invertible or not commutative with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
