  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nIf the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) is increased, will the absolute value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( a \\\\) alters the function's growth rate and oscillatory behavior, but due to the complex exponential nature and depending on the path C, the integral might not necessarily increase. The integration over complex contours can result in cancellation effects, depending on the interaction between \\\\( a \\\\) and the geometry of C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
