  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and is then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the initial state by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) introduces an exponential growth or decay depending on the real part of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) changes, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any subsequent time will not be the same as without the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
