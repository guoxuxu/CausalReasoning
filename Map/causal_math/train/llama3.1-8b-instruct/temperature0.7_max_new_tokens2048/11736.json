  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified by a transformation using a Laplace transform with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve into \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at any future time t be influenced solely by the initial form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Once the transformation is applied through \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is solely determined by the initial signal and the characteristics of the transfer function as defined by their Laplace transforms. There are no other influences on the signal afterwards in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
