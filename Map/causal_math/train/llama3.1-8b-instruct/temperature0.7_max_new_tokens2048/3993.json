  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a time-dependent input vector and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of introducing a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) over time t, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(s) \\\\) before computing \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied to the inputs \\\\( x(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(s) \\\\) by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{Bs} \\\\) at each instant s. This affects the integral computation by altering both the magnitude and orientation of the input within the integral. The result is a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\), as the dynamics introduced by B have a compounded effect over time on \\\\( x(s) \\\\) before they are integrated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
