  "Problem": "Consider a system dynamics where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle in a one-dimensional space is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t) + F(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) a positive constant representing damping and \\\\( F(t) \\\\) an external force function. The study involves the introduction of a sudden force impulse \\\\( F(t) = I \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\), where \\\\( I \\\\) is the impulse magnitude and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nIf at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( t_1 > t_0 \\\\)), an intervention modifies \\\\( F(t) \\\\) to be another impulse of different magnitude, will the final position of the particle depend solely on the first impulse?",
  "Explanation": "Since a second impulse modifies the trajectory again at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the final position will be influenced by both impulses. The resultant motion of the particle will depend on the effects of both impulses, not just the first.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
