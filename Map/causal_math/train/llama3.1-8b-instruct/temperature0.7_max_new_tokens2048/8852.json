  "Problem": "Let's consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. We'll explore how different integral transforms, specifically the Laplace Transform, affect our response to changes in control strategy depicted by \\\\( u(t) = V(t)x + W(t) \\\\), where V(t) and W(t) are time-varying matrices.\n\nGiven the final state observed \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine which control strategies were used throughout the interval [0, T], based on knowing only the system parameters M and N?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could arise from a plethora of differing control strategies due to the different behavioral modifications introduced by V(t), W(t), Q(t), and R(t). Without specific knowledge of these matrices throughout the operational timeline, the inference of precise control strategies from the outcome is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
