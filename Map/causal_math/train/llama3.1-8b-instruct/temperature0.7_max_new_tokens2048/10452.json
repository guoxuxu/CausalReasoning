  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze how the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter, affects the output.\n\nGiven the outcome of the system at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) after interventions including both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we precisely deduce whether both functions were applied, and in which sequence?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the exponential transformation and the addition of a complex constant lead to a scenario where multiple paths might yield the same final result. The non-commutativity of additions and integral transformations in the complex plane obscures the sequence and presence of specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
