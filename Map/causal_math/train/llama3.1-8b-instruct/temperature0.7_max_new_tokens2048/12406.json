  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and its effect on a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = f(t) \\\\). Assume all functions involved are sufficiently smooth and decay at infinity for the Fourier transform to exist.\n\nIf a damping term \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant) is introduced as an intervention to the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) during the progression, does this change the final form of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the equation \\\\( s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s) \\\\) after adapting for \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the damping term modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t)e^{-at} \\\\). This affects the Fourier transform of \\\\( f \\\\), changing it to \\\\( F(s+a) \\\\). Therefore, the differential equation in terms of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and the new \\\\( F(s+a) \\\\) would not be the same as before, altering the relationship and the solution for \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
