  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, and A and B are real constants. This function is used to transform the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} z(t) dt \\\\) affects the output over a period T.\n\nGiven the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) at T, is it possible to uniquely determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether additional functions were applied to it?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) at T is influenced by the exponential factors involving both A and B through the interval. Without knowledge of these factors or potential other transformations, one cannot retrospectively deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially given the loss of information inherent in integration over an interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
