  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. We explore the effects of a transformation using Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega) \\\\), especially its impact on the solution characteristics over time.\n\nBased on the wave characteristics at \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\), can we conclusively determine whether both Fourier and Laplace transforms were applied or just one of them, without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The overlay of transformation effects due to both Fourier and Laplace transformations, especially in the presence of potential nonlinear interactions or modifications, makes it ambiguous to backtrack the specific transformations used purely based on observing \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\). The transformations could influence various components in a way that is not easily distinguishable at the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
