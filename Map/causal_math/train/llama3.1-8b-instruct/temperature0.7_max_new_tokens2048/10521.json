  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. This function models a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). Additionally, analyze the impact of a Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and its implications on causality inferences.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the result of a Laplace transform at any later time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if calculated directly at that time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at any time will consistently yield \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), independent of the specific time \\\\( t \\\\) chosen, due to the time-invariance property of the exponential function in the context of Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
