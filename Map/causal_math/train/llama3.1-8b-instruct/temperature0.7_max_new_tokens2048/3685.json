  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), showing simple harmonic motion in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. Let's investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\) applied to z(t).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially set and evolves according to its definition without any intervention, will the result of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at any time t depend on the initial function definition alone?",
  "Explanation": "Since no intervention alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) will compute based solely on the predefined function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). The transformation outcome at any time t depends directly on this initial set function, reflecting the integral of the harmonic motion in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
