  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit in which the voltage across a capacitor undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined by \\\\(F(v(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty v(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), where \\\\(v(t)\\\\) is a voltage function of time, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We're analyzing the impact of the operation defined by the transfer function \\\\(H(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + i\\\\omega\\\\tau}\\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nGiven a time-domain signal obtained after applying \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\) and then performing an inverse Fourier transform, can we infer the original voltage \\\\(v(t)\\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the irreversible nature of some spectral changes introduced by \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), particularly frequency attenuation or phase shifts, reconstructing the original \\\\(v(t)\\\\) precisely from the altered time-domain signal without knowledge of \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\)'s settings (specifically \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\)) is typically impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
