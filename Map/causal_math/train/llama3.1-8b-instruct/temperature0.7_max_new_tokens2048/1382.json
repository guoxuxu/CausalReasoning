  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider transformations of the form \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z + \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we infer the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is challenging to trace back to the exact initial conditions since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could have altered the starting state and trajectory in a way not discernible just from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
