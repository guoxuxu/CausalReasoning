  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. To analyze this scenario, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) immediately after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the endpoint function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve independently of the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) used before the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Upon changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) strictly depends on the new parameter \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\). This alteration fundamentally changes the trajectory, causing it to follow a path dictated by the new differential equation with \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), making it independent of the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
