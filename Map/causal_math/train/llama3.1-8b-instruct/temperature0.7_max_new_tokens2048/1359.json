  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. The function describes a circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) on this periodic function.\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is introduced at some time t = 0 and then the function is transformed, will the Laplace transform still indicate a simple harmonic motion?",
  "Explanation": "By introducing a damping factor, the transformed function changes to \\\\( \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i\\omega} \\\\), where the original undamped simple harmonic form is altered, showing an exponential decay in amplitude, thus indicating damped harmonic motion instead of simple harmonic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "angular frequency (ω) → periodic function (z(t)); damping factor (e^(-αt)) → change in function (z(t)); change in function (z(t)) → Laplace transformation; Laplace transformation → indication of simple harmonic motion"
