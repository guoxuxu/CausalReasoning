  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions due to the unitary nature of the matrices involved and their potential to preserve certain vector qualities while altering others. This results in a non-unique solution for recovering the sequences and types of interventions used, as multiple valid pathways could lead to the same endpoint through different intermediate transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
