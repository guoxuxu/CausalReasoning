  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), with \\( B \\) also a constant matrix, is applied at time \\( t \\). We explore the effect of this transformation on the system's evolution.\n\nIf during the evolution, a second transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) (where \\( C \\) is another constant matrix) is applied at some point \\( t = t_1 \\), will \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) solely depend on \\( A \\) and not \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\( T \\) after the intervention \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) is influenced by both transformations \\( e^{Bt} \\) and \\( e^{Ct} \\), along with the natural evolution due to \\( A \\). Hence, \\( z(T) \\) depends on all three - \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
