  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a transformation, defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the system dynamically depending on both \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and the state of z at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), reflecting the compositional effects of the transformations on z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
