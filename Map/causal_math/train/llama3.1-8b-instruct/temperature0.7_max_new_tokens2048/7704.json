  "Problem": "Consider a mapping defined by the integral transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) where x(t) is a time-dependent function and s is a complex parameter. We explore how changes in the time-domain function influence the result of the integral transform and vice versa.\n\nKnowing the end result of the transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at s = a+bi, can we determine specifically whether the modification was due to convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or a direct alteration of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) itself?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at a specific s-value provides limited information and several manipulations of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) like direct scaling, addition of functions, or convolution with different \\\\( h(t) \\\\) could lead to similar features in \\\\( X(s) \\\\). Distinguishing between convolution and alteration just from \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is not feasible without additional time-domain data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
