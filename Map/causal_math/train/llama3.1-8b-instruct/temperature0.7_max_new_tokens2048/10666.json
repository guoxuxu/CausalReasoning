  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is subject to a transformation using a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = Ay(t) + Bx(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, and the transformation \\\\( h(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is a filter applied to the output signal, with C and D also being constant matrices.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(t) = h(t)*y(t) \\\\) for a specific t = T and knowing the function h(t), can we unequivocally determine \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the transformation specifics or the initial conditions of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the result \\\\( z(t) = h(t)*y(t) \\\\) depends on the convolution properties and the potential alterations in \\\\( y(t) \\\\) caused by initial conditions and interactions in the system dynamics led by A, B, and x(t). Without explicit knowledge of these and assuming non-inversibility of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the original \\\\( y(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
