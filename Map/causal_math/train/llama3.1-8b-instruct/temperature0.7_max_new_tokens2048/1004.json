  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a matrix-valued function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane and is examined over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or neither were applied, only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or none) solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible. The transformations might produce overlapping effects on the trajectory, and multiple combinations of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint due to the properties of matrix multiplication and exponential functions in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
