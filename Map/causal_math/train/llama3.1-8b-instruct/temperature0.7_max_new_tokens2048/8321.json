  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The function is subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Wz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Wz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) modifies the initial state of the function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), changing its path of evolution. Depending on how matrix \\\\( U \\\\) relates to \\\\( W \\\\), especially if they do not commute, the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) can be altered fundamentally, resulting in a different state at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
