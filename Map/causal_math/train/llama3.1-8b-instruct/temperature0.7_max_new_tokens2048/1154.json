  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Dz \\\\), where D is a linear differential operator. Investigate the influence of a transformation characterised by \\\\( h(z) = z^{k}e^{Ct} \\\\) on the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where k is a non-zero scalar and C is a constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X, can we determine the precise initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The unknown application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguity in back-calculating to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could significantly alter the original condition, and without this knowledge, it's impossible to accurately trace back.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
