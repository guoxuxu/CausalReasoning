  "Problem": "Consider a vibrational system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\zeta \\\\) is the damping ratio and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the natural frequency. We study the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) = (e^{At}x, e^{At}\\\\dot{x}) \\\\), where A is a scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( (x(T), \\\\dot{x}(T)) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\), \\\\( g(x, \\\\dot{x}) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the values at T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the exponential transformations applied and the effects of system damping and natural oscillations, multiple combinations of interventions (A, B) can produce similar states at T. The interaction effects and overlapping potential states create ambiguity in uniquely identifying the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
