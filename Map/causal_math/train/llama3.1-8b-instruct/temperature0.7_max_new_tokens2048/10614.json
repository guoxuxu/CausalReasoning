  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nGiven the transform output \\\\( F(z) \\\\) up to time T, can we uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the transformation effects captured by \\\\( F(z) \\\\), as different values of \\\\( s \\\\) can lead to different forms of decay and thus modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that cannot be accurately reverted.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
