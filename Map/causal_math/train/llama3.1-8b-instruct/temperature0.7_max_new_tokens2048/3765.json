  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the charge \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) on a capacitor evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{Q} = -\\\\frac{Q}{RC} + I(t) \\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is an external current source. We examine the impact of modifying the circuit by changing the resistance to a new value \\\\( R' \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf the resistance \\\\( R \\\\) is changed to \\\\( R' \\\\) during the charging process, will this change the time constant \\\\( \\\\tau = RC \\\\) such that the charge dynamics \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) will differ from the scenario without changing resistance?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the resistance changes the time constant, affecting how quickly the capacitor charges or discharges. Consequently, the dynamics of charge on the capacitor, described by \\\\( Q(t) \\\\), will differ as the rate of exponential decay or rise changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
