  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, D. An integral transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) dt\\\\) releases a transformed state over a variable S.\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed state \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was or wasn’t applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the integral transformation was applied, determining the original function just from the transformed endpoint is infeasible. The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) fundamentally changes the trajectory in a way that is not immediately inferable from the endpoint alone due to the irreversible nature of integral operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
