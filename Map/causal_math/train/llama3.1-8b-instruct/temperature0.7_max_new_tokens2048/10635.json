  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the original function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transformation into the complex s-plane. We study the effects of a convolution operation with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented by its transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf during the transformation process an additional scaling function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) with Laplace transform \\\\( P(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), modifying it to \\\\( r(t) = p(t) * h(t) \\\\), will the result \\\\( R(s) \\\\) be affected only by the scale transform \\\\( P(s) \\\\) and not by the original kernel \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform \\\\( R(s) \\\\) will be affected by both the scaling function and the original kernel, as it is the product of the Laplace transformations of \\\\( p(t) \\\\), \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), namely \\\\( R(s) = P(s)F(s)G(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
