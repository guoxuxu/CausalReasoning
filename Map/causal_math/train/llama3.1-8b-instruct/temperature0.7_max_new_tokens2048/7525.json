  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the consequences of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over a time period [0,T].\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t=0 to T, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is further evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz\\\\) to t = 2T without any additional transformation, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = 2T be identical to the direct application at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The further evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz\\\\) from T to 2T changes the function's behavior, thus altering its Fourier transform. Since the system's dynamics continuously evolve, the Fourier transform at each interval represents different state characteristics and thus will not be the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
