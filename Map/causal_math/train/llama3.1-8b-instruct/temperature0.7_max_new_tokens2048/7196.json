  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform, represented by the function \\\\( F(u) \\\\), to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and how this affects the behavior over time.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine what interventions were undertaken (applying \\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both), based solely on the information about \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) and the exponential operator transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\) on the system complicate the traceability of specific interventions. Since these operations can modify the trajectory in a non-linear and non-exclusive manner, it's generally not possible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
