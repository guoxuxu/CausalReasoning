  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent field described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax - By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's responses to transformations given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex scalar.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves naturally under the given differential equations, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T align with the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same conditions but without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) changes the initial state which subsequently alters the trajectory of the evolution. The factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) introduces a modification that grows exponentially with time, influencing both the magnitude and phase of the original path, resulting in a different outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
