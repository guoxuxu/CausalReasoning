  "Problem": "Analyze a complex electrical circuit involving resistors (R), capacitors (C), and inductors (L), modeled by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int I dt\\\\), where V is voltage, I is current, t is time, and R, L, C are constants. Consider the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\\\), applied to V(t).\n\nGiven the composite Laplace transform \\\\(I(s)\\\\) at time T, can we determine exactly which voltage sources (V0 or V1 or both) were applied to the circuit at any given prior time points?",
  "Explanation": "The composite effects of multiple, potentially varying, voltage sources lead to an overlapping impact in the Laplace domain. This makes it challenging to distinctly trace back and identify specific sources from the resultant I(s); multiple configurations of voltage inputs could yield similar transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
