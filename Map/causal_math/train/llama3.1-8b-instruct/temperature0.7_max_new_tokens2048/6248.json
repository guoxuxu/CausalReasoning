  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) undergoing the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane. The system's behavior is analyzed against the backdrop of an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), with s as a complex parameter.\n\nBased on the ending integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), is it possible to specifically identify which transformations (initial \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) or intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\)) were applied, by observing only \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specifically the transformations applied is challenging without additional information because different combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) could potentially lead to the same resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The overlapping effects of these transformations on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) mask the clarity of individual contributions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
