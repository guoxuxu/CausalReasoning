  "Problem": "In a control system, an input vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) to produce an output \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\). An additional operator \\\\(M\\\\), a constant matrix, is later used to alter the system's response.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to determine whether operations \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), or \\\\(N\\\\) were applied, or in what sequence, merely by observing \\\\(y(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\(y(T)\\\\) could result from different operations and sequences due to the linear transformations' superposition and compositional nature. Predicting the exact operations or their sequence from merely the output without additional context is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
