  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents the angular frequency. We analyze the manipulation of system dynamics by introducing a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\)\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), can we accurately determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) encodes the frequency and decay information about \\\\( z(t) \\\\), but without knowing the specific value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), multiple original functions can yield the same transform results due to the ambiguity in determining oscillation frequencies solely from the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
