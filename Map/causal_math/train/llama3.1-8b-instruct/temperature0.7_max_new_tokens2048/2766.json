  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), is it possible to accurately determine \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T\\\\) modifies the starting state in such a way that recovering the exact \\\\(u_0\\\\) from \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at any later time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing about the application of \\\\(T\\\\) is infeasible. The integral transformation effectively obscures certain characteristics of the original function \\\\(u_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
