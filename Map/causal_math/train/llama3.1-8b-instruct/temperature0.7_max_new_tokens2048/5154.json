  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) where S is a complex square matrix. The system evaluates the function's behavior under the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf we observe the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t=T, can we unequivocally determine the initial function form \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) at u=0?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, by its integrating nature, generally loses some specific information about the initial function, except under special conditions where the matrix S has properties (like commutativity) that uniquely determine e^{Su} from its transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
