  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator on function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\). To analyze the system's behavior, we explore the effect of applying Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), particularly focusing on the transformation over time.\n\nIf during the evolution an additional transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}[u] = \\\\mathcal{F}[G(x)u]\\\\) (where \\\\(G(x)\\\\) is a spatially varying function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u](k, T)\\\\) depend only on operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(G(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}\\\\) alters the spatial domain properties of the function, which when transformed could lead to a different evolution trajectory under \\\\(L\\\\). This makes the final state dependent not only on the original PDE operator but also significantly on the intervention by \\\\(G(x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
