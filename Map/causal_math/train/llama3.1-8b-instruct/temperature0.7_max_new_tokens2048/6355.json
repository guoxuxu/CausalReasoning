  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix, applied at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = Dz \\\\) (where D is another constant complex matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) means the behavior of the system is now influenced by D as well as by C. The transformations have cumulative effects and depending on non-commutative properties of matrix multiplication in complex space, the outcome at time T will depend on all matrices A, B, C, and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
