  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the effects of a linear fractional transformation \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{cz + d}{bz + e} \\\\), with constants \\\\( b, c, d, e \\\\) on the transformed function.\n\nIf \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is subsequently computed without further modifications, does this equal directly applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then transforming the outcome using \\\\( L(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) alters the input to the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\), modifying its output due to the non-commutativity of function composition in complex functions. Transforming before applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) results in different behavior than transforming the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z_0; z_0 → L(z_0); L(z_0) → g(L(z_0)); g(z_0) → g(L(z_0)); L(g(z_0)) → g(L(z_0))"
