  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) concerning the spatial variable x.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant, is applied at a time t > 0, will the transformed state \\\\( V(s, t) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the intervention \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the system by modulating it with \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), and the Laplace transform of the modified function would lead to a different differential equation, \\\\( \\\\frac{dV}{dt} = (\\\\lambda - k s^2) V(s, t) \\\\). Thus, the resulting state \\\\( V(s, t) \\\\) in the Laplace domain depends on both \\\\( k \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
