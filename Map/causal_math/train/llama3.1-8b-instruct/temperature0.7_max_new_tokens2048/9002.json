  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the complex variable. Determine how transformations by function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) at specific instances influence the behavior of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) over the complex plane.\n\nIf observing the function at a point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we infer the original form of the function at z = 0, assuming no knowledge of any transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether a transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or any similar function occurred, it's impossible to definitively trace back to the original function at z = 0. The transformation could have fundamentally altered the function in ways that are not discernible just from its state at \\\\( z_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
