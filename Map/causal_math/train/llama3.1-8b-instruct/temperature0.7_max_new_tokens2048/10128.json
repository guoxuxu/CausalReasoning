  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a 2x2 matrix. Evaluate the effects of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on this system at different stages.\n\nGiven the transformed final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the Laplace transformation, can we exclusively determine whether the intervention with vector \\\\( v \\\\) was used or deduce its magnitude, relying only on knowledge of P?",
  "Explanation": "The presence and magnitude of the vector \\\\( v \\\\) intervention, as well as the initial conditions affected by the Laplace transformation, contribute to the state at T in a possibly non-exclusive and non-deducible way. The overlap of effects from P, the Laplace transform, and the vector addition makes it difficult to isolate the contribution of each component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
