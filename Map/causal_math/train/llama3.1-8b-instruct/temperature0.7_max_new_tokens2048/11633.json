  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t) = exp(i \\\\omega t)\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We are examining how applying the Laplace transform affects the behavior of \\\\(z\\\\) over time and how interventions through different parameters might impact the eventual outcome.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is subsequently evolved without further intervention, will the transformed output at t = T differ from \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( exp(i \\\\omega t) \\\\) is not the same as the function itself at any specific time T; it provides a s-domain representation integrating exponential growth factors, changing the nature of the output compared to simply evaluating \\\\( exp(i \\\\omega T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
