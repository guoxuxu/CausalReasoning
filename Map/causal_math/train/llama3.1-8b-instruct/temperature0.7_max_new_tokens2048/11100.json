  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\\\( g(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) dx \\\\) over the input function u.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations were applied (\\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), assuming multiple transformations could lead to the same outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\), especially considering functional overlaps and the non-inverse nature of some integral transformations. This ambiguity prevents certain identification of the applied transformations purely from \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
