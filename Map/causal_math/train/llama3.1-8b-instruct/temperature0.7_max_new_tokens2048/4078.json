  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nHaving observed the evolved Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at a later time, can we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at the initial time without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform can theoretically be inverted back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), without knowing the differential equation used in its evolution, multiple differential operations might correspond to the same transformation result, making the original function indeterminable without extra data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
