  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) under an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final output of the transformed function, can we accurately back-calculate to find both the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the exact times and nature of any interventions (changes in \\\\( s \\\\))? ",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interplay between the frequency and decay parameters and their influence over different parts of the integration interval, it's generally infeasible to unequivocally determine both the original frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and details about any changes in decay parameter \\\\( s \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
