  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation given by \\\\( z = F(x) \\\\) where \\\\( F \\\\) is an integral operator defined as \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\), and A is an exponent matrix. We are exploring the effect of a secondary operator \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} B(t)x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B(t) \\\\) is another matrix function controlling the transformation's behavior.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the system initially transformed by \\\\( G(x) \\\\), can we reliably reverse engineer to the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the use of \\\\( G(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about the application of \\\\( G(x) \\\\) means that any attempts to retrieve \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will face ambiguities. The transformation \\\\( B(t) \\\\) affects the integration process and without precise knowledge of this, the original function cannot be accurately determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
