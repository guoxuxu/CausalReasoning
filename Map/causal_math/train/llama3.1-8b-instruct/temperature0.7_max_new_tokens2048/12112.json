  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the impact of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z + T \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is a real constant, over different scenarios.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( f(L(z_0)) = f(z_0) \\\\) at some time T?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the argument of \\\\( f \\\\) by adding T, which changes the value of the exponential function since \\\\( e^{i \\omega (z_0 + T)} \\\\) is generally not equal to \\\\( e^{i \\omega z_0} \\\\) except for specific values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega T = 2\\pi k \\\\) (k being an integer).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
