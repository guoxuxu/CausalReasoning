  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt\\\\) where z is a complex variable and f(t) represents a real-valued function of t. This integral transform is fundamental in solving differential equations and analyzing signal systems.\n\nKnowing the final transformed function \\\\(u(z)\\\\), can we determine whether the intervention was applied in the form of \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) and identify the value of a, assuming no prior knowledge of the function form?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether an exponential modification by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) was applied and identifying a purely from the transformed function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) is not feasible without additional information. The transformation obscures specific details about the functional form of interventions applied prior, including the parameter a.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
