  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively. Here, A and B are real constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is considered in the analysis.\n\nGiven the transformed value \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at T after applications of both the original and an intervention function, can we accurately deduce the exact nature and timing of interventions applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) within the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is a cumulative measure that incorporates all changes smoothly and does not retain explicit details regarding the nature, timing, or sequence of interventions. It reflects integrated effects rather than distinct intervention signatures, making reconstruction of the specifics of interventions ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
