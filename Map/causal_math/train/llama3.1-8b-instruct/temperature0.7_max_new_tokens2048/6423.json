  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the equation of motion is derived from the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is momentum, \\\\( m \\\\) is mass, and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is a potential energy function. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to the position function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta x \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\) is a small perturbation) is applied as an intervention, will the waveform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on the initial Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the system by a definable perturbation \\\\( \\\\delta x \\\\), affecting the trajectory and consequently the state at any time T. Thus, the Fourier Transform at time T will depend both on the initial conditions and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
