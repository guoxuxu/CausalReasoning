  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\) where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + Nu\\\\), with constant matrices M and N and control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\). We explore how this integral transformation affects causal inference in different scenario contexts.\n\nIf an intervention is performed by modifying the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will this change the outcome of the integral transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at time T > \\\\(t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by changing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) alters the input to the system, which modifies the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) according to the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + Nu\\\\). This in turn changes the integral \\\\(h(z)\\\\) by adding or modifying contributions to the integral based on the new input trajectory influenced by \\\\(u(t)\\\\), directly impacting the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
