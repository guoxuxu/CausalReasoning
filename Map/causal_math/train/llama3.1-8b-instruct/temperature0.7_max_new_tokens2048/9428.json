  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nGiven the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T, can we determine whether one or multiple transformations were applied (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or both), given we only observe the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of k and m can produce equivalent behaviors at x = T due to the properties of exponentiation in the complex exponential function. Without precise timestamps or knowledge of the interventions, it is impossible to distinguish whether one or both transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
