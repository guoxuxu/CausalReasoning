  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) is the wave function and H is the Hamiltonian operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iK} \\\\psi \\\\), with K being a constant operator, is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( g(\\\\psi) = e^{iL}\\\\psi \\\\) (where L is another constant operator) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on H and not on K or L?",
  "Explanation": "The series of transformations starting with \\\\( e^{iK} \\\\) and followed by \\\\( e^{iL} \\\\) implies that the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) is a result of all these compounded phase factors influenced by K and L, in addition to the dynamics governed by H. The final state depends critically on how L and K interact with H, influencing the resultant physical properties of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
