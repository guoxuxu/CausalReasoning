  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a constant complex matrix. Analyze the consequences of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dz}z \\\\) over complex variable z, with D being another constant complex matrix.\n\nAfter observing the end state of \\\\( z \\\\) following its evolution, can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as the transformation \\\\( e^{Dz} \\\\) could have modified it in multiple ways that are indistinguishable at a later time, especially if \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
