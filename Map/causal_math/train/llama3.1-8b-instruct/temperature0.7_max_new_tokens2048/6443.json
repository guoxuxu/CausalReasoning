  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\( S(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of modifying this system using another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) over time t, where M is a transformation matrix that describes an intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 be independent of the matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of the system by applying \\\\( M \\\\). However, the overall dynamics are still governed by the matrix D, as it dictates the linear evolution both before and after the intervention. Thus, the final state still depends on both matrices, D and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
