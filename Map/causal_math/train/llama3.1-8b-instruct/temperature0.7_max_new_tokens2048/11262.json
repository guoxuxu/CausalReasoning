  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the Laplace Transform on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial t^2} = -\\\\alpha^2 h \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. The scenario investigates how transformations influence the solution and inference of initial conditions or operations on the function.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at a specific parameter \\\\( s \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the initial conditions of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial conditions of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) despite having its Laplace Transform. The parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) critically influences the behavior of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and thus its transform, meaning the initial conditions could correspond to multiple possible sets of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) values.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
