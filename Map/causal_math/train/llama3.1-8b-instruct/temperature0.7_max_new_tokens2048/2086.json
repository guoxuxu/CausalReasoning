  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) periodically, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) was applied, there is indeterminacy in determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because both the linear transformation and nonlinear dynamics could modify the state in multiple ways, leading to non-unique possibilities for \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
