  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\), where D is the diffusion constant. Consider the effect of applying a transformation using a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), which alters the initial condition by a function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the transform space.\n\nCan the original untransformed initial condition be identified from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing if \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the Laplace transformation application, the alterations induced in the spectral or frequency domain make it difficult to deduce the original condition uniquely as several transformed conditions can lead to similar states at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
