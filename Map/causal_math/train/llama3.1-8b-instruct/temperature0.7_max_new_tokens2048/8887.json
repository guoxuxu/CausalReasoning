  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional phase shift transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\phi t} \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is a constant, will the subsequent behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be affected only by \\\\( \\phi \\\\) and not \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shifting factor that will alter the resultant trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The overall behavior at time T depends on both the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the newly introduced phase \\\\( \\phi \\\\), as these factors cumulatively define the resultant wave's characteristics at any later time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
