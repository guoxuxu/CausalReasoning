  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( H(z) = z + \\\\delta \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\), independent of the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added operation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) introduces yet another factor affecting \\\\( z(T) \\\\), but the overall state at \\\\( T \\\\) still retains dependencies on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) due to their roles in the dynamic equation. Both the original equation and the sequential transformations impact the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
