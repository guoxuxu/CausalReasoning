  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( V(t) = e^{-iKt/\\\\hbar} \\\\) (where K is another Hamiltonian operator) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on H and not on K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( V(t) \\\\) introduces a new modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) dependent on both H and K. Both Hamiltonian operators influence the evolution by affecting the phase and configuration of the wave function, leading to a state that is dependent on the specifics of both H and K.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
