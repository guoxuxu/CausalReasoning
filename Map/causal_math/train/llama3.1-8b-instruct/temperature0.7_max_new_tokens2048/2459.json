  "Problem": "Consider a closed system involving a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole. The input signal is \\\\( x(t) = e^{st} \\\\). We study the system's behavior under Laplace transforms and analyze the effects of introducing an interrupting signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the step function.\n\nIf the system with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is interrupted by injecting a signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), would the exponential term \\\\( e^{qt} \\\\) dominate the system's response indefinitely thereafter?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\) modifies the system state permanently from \\\\( t_0 \\\\) onwards. As the step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) extends infinity, the new input signal's effect, primarily dominated by \\\\( e^{qt} \\\\), will override preceding conditions and dictate the system's behavior indefinitely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
