  "Problem": "Consider a physical scenario where heat propagation in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity. We analyze the system's response to a time-dependent boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional cooling is applied at the opposite end of the rod periodically represented by \\\\( u(L,t) = \\cos(\\mu t)\\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is the length of the rod and \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is a constant, will this intervention impact the heat distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced cooling condition will alter the heat distribution across the rod, influencing the overall thermal gradient and temperature profile at any time T > t_1. The effects combine both boundary conditions dynamically as per the governing heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
