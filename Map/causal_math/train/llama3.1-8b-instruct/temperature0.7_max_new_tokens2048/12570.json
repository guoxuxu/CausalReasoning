  "Problem": "Imagine a system of differential equations given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = Kz(t)\\\\), where K is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}z(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying another transformation \\\\( q(z) = e^{-Mt}z(t) \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original dynamics set by K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( q(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system states, thereby making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) influenced by both the integral transformation and the respective matrices M and K. The dynamics are fundamentally altered by the sequential impacts of these transformations, making the system's evolution dependent on more than just K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
