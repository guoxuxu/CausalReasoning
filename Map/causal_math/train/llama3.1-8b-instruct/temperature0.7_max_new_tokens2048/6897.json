  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are increased by a factor, without any other intervention, will the response function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) scale proportionally?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear, increasing \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by a constant factor proportionally scales \\\\( v(t) \\\\), when convolved with a linear system's impulse response, results in the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) being scaled by the same factor, thus demonstrating the principle of superposition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
