  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation involving the Fourier integral representation by applying the transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{as} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nIf the original time function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is altered by a multiplicative constant transformation \\\\( k \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under its natural transform properties without further manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at any later point only depend on the initial properties given by \\\\( n \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( k \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) scales the entire function, which then influences the Laplace transform, resulting in a scaling of the transform by \\\\( k \\\\) as well, indicated by \\\\( kF(s) = k/s^{n+1} e^{as} \\\\. Therefore, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depends on \\\\( k \\\\), altering its subsequent characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
