  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. The Laplace transform of the function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} + i\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the function in the s-domain. We further apply an integral transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( G(s) \\\\), or both) by observing the final state \\\\( z''(T) \\\\) if we know only the elapsed time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the composite nature of applied transformations and their potentially non-unique effects, one cannot determine explicitly which transformations were used just from the final state \\\\( z''(T) \\\\). Different sequences or types of transformations might yield similar or indistinguishable results at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
