  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-varying signal with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} f(s) ds \\\\) over the function z(t).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to operate under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the transformed signal \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T mimic the original signal behavior of z(t) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) fundamentally changes the signal characteristics. The operation of \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) causes the resultant integral to introduce phase shifts and amplitude modifications, leading to a signal that differs from the original \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
