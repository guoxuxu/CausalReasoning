  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u}\\\\) to the function u and then analyzing its behavior under different scenarios.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the linearity and reversibility of L and under the assumption that we can invert L, knowing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) would allow us to calculate \\\\(u_0\\\\), irrespective of the application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). The Fourier transform, being invertible, does not obscure the causal path from \\\\(u_0\\\\) to \\\\(u(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
