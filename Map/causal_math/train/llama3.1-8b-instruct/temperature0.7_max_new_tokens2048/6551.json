  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We examine the system's response to the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( S \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an external function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Rt} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) (where R is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the resultant state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by P and not by S or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional influence on the system, dependent on the matrix R as well as the original S. The behavior of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will thus be affected by both calculations from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), making the system's evolution and final state a result of the interaction of P, S, and R.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
