  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) evolving over time governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent real and imaginary components respectively. A Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ z(t) \\} = Z(s) \\) is applied to examine the system in the s-domain.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_0 \\) a known intervention is applied modifying \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) to fit the Cauchy-Riemann equations strictly, will the resulting \\( Z(s) \\) reflect this adherence continuously for all \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention, while making \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) comply with the Cauchy-Riemann equations at \\( t_0 \\), does not guarantee this compliance through every point in time domain due to potential complex dynamics, which impacts the transform \\( Z(s) \\) variably for different s-values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "intervention → x(t); intervention → y(t); x(t) → z(t); y(t) → z(t); z(t) → Z(s); Z(s) → s-domain analysis; s-domain analysis → adherence to Cauchy-Riemann equations"
