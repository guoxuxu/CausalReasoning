  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) applied in a calculus context on a closed contour \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of various transformations and integrations of the function over the contour.\n\nIf we integrate \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without any deformations of the contour, will the integral value be the same as if we directly computed the integral of \\\\( e^z \\\\) over \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) by definition, the integral of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over \\\\( C \\\\) remains unchanged and is directly equivalent to the integral of \\\\( e^z \\\\) over the same contour. There are no modifications to the function or the contour, so they yield the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "contour deformation → change in integral value; direct computation → accurate integral value; integration of f(z) over C → direct computation of integral; integration of f(z) over C → contour deformation; e^z → f(z); deformation of contour C → change in integral value"
