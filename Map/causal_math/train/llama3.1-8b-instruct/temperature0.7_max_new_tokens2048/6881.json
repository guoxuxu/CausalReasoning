  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without any further modifications, does this transformation fundamentally change the function in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), which is a different representation in the complex frequency domain, altering its original time-domain behavior and properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
