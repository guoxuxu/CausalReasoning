  "Problem": "Let's analyze a scenario involving the Laplace transform in the context of signal processing. The initial signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is given, and its transformation through the Laplace transform is considered as \\\\( S(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s(t))(s) \\\\). Various manipulations and operations are applied to study the causal relationships between transformations and signals.\n\nAssuming the final modified signal in the s-domain \\\\( \\\\tilde{S}(s) \\\\) is observed, can we unambiguously determine the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) in the time domain without knowing the exact transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformations applied to \\\\( S(s) \\\\), multiple different time-domain signals could potentially result in the same s-domain representation due to properties of the Laplace transform, i.e., different causal paths can lead to the same effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
