  "Problem": "We consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) that maps complex numbers to complex functions, given by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We investigate the impact of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and examine the causal effects in the Laplace transform domain.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and then the Laplace transform is taken without further intervention, will \\\\( z(s) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\) be the same as the original \\\\( z(s) \\\\) for \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) changes the form of the original function, affecting the Laplace transform through the additional \\\\( t^2 \\\\) multiplier. This alteration modifies the decay and oscillatory characteristics in the transform domain, leading to a different \\\\( z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
