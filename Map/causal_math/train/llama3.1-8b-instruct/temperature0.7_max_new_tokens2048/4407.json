  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( z(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Let an intervention be defined as a multiplication by matrix \\\\( P \\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nIf the intervention defined by matrix \\\\( P \\\\) is applied at t=0 before \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) reflect only the effects of the matrix M regardless of P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\( P \\\\) changes the initial state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Pz(0) \\\\). This modified initial condition will influence the future state trajectory under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) and hence also alter the outcome of the Laplace transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The effect of P cannot be disregarded.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
