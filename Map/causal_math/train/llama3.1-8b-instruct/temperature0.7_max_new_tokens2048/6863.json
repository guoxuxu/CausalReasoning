  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we study the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{t^{2}} dt \\\\) over a complex variable z, with w being another constant complex number.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying a different transformation \\\\( k(z) = \\\\log(z) \\\\) at a specific complex point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will the final output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) solely depend on the original transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or also on \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another complexity in the evaluation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The logarithmic transformation can significantly alter the integration limits and the nature of the integrand due to its peculiar properties in the complex domain. Thus, the final output will depend on both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
