  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We inspect the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) is initially applied to \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\), leading to the transformed condition \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\), then allowed to evolve under the heat equation, will \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to the case where \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) evolved without the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the mode of analysis from physical space to frequency space, affecting how the solution evolves over time. The inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) needed to retrieve \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) involves convolution with a kernel that incorporates time-dependent factors, yielding a different result from the original heat propagation without transform.",
