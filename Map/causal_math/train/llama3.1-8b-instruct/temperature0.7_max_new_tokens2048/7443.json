  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex function, and both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The interaction between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) via \\\\( u \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention using another function \\\\( v \\\\), transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\; (0 < t_1 < T) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) demonstrate effects based solely on the new function matrix characteristics and not on the initial interaction matrix of \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention by \\\\( v \\\\) interacts with the already modified state trajectories imparted by \\\\( u \\\\). As such, \\\\( z(T) \\\\)'s final state will depend on how both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) have altered the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), including their interaction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
