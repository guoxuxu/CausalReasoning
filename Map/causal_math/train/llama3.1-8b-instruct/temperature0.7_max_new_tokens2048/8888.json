  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\).\n\nGiven the functional behavior at a later time T, can we uniquely identify whether the original function was subjected to an intervention like \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or determine the constants \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping nature of the effects caused by the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\), multiple combinations of these parameters can result in the same function value at time T. It is thus impossible to uniquely backtrack and specify the specific interventions or original parameters just by knowing the function's state at a later time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
