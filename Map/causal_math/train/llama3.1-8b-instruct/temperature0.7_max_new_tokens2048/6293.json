  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and analyze its transformation under the Laplace transform. Assume that the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) for \\\\( Re(s) > 1 \\\\).\n\nDoes performing a Laplace transform on \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) without additional functional manipulation lead to a result that depends directly and only on the characteristics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The definition of the Laplace transform ensures it is a mathematical operation that directly depends on the properties of the function being transformed, without the need for further intervention. In this case, the result \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) directly derives from and depends upon the characteristics of the function \\\\( e^{z} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
