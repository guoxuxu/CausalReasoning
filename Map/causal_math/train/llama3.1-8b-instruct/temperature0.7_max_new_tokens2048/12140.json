  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the Laplace Transform, \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\. We apply the Laplace Transform to the exponential growth function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant. We then examine how an intervention using the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\), affects the transformed function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nWill the spectrum of \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) when directly applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without intervention be the same when intervention is applied before the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Directly applying \\\\( L(e^{at})(s) \\\\) yields \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), a function solely dependent on \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). The absence of any intervention preserves the expected transform characteristic specific to \\\\( e^{at} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
