  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) on a bounded domain with initial displacement given by \\\\(u(x,0) = f(x)\\\\) and a Fourier transform applied to the displacement as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x)dx\\\\). We consider how interventions via changes in boundary conditions or initial conditions affect the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely the initial conditions and type of boundary condition interventions applied, based solely on the wave profile \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The wave profile at time T, \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), results from the complex interplay between initial conditions, boundary conditions, and any changes to them. Due to the non-uniqueness in some components under the Fourier transformation (especially pertaining to phase information and boundary behavior), multiple configurations of initial conditions and interventions could lead to similar or even identical wave profiles at a given time T.",
