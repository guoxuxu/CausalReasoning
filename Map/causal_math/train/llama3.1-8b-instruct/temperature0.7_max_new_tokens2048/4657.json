  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) undergoes transformations described by multiplication with matrices. We analyze the sequence where \\\\(x_0\\\\) is first multiplied by matrix \\\\(P\\\\) and then matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) over period t, expressed as \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\). A new transformation matrix \\\\(R\\\\) can be used as an intervention.\n\nIf vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) is initially transformed by \\\\(P\\\\) followed by \\\\(Q\\\\), and let to evolve under the sequence \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\) without further intervention, will the result at t = T for some T > 0 be equivalently achieved by directly applying \\\\(QP\\\\) to \\\\(x_0\\\\) without separately applying \\\\(P\\\\) and then \\\\(Q\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since matrix multiplication is associative, the application of \\\\(P\\\\) followed by \\\\(Q\\\\) (i.e., \\\\(Q(Px_0)\\\\) which equals \\\\(QP x_0\\\\)) is equivalent to the direct application of \\\\(QP\\\\). Thus, the sequence does not alter the end outcome compared to the direct application of \\\\(QP\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
