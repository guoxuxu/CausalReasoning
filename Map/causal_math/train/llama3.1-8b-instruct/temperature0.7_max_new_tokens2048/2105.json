  "Problem": "Analyzing a system governed by a set of differential equations, \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and \\(u\\) represents an external control input related via the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\) where D and E are matrix functions of time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(u(t) = D(t)z + E(t)\\\\) is initially applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu\\\\) without further changes to \\\\(D(t)\\\\) or \\\\(E(t)\\\\), will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for some T > 0 purely depend on the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Although the initial conditions are set by the transformation, the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time is dynamically influenced by both M and N through the external control \\(u\\), which itself evolves with \\(z\\). The dependency on \\(D(t)\\) and \\(E(t)\\) over the interval also influences the behavior of \\(u(t)\\) and thus \\(z(T)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
