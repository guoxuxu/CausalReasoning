  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation. Analyzing the behavior between the Laplacian and Fourier transformations of the function as it manifests in the complex domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied directly to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and then the system is observed in the s-domain, will the result be indicative of the original behavior of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as predicted by Laplace's transform without external modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the domain in which the function is analyzed, which might not consistently correspond to the s-domain used in the Laplace transform without accounting for the differences in boundary conditions and integral kernels.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
