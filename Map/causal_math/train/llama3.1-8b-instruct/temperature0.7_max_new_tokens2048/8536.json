  "Problem": "Investigate a system where current flows through an electrical circuit influenced by a complex function transform. The current \\( I(t) \\) is governed by \\( \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0 \\) where \\( R \\) is resistance and \\( V_0 \\) a voltage source. We explore the behavior under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) and its inverse.\n\nGiven \\( I(t) \\) at any time after intervention with \\( V_1 e^{-Rt} \\), can we completely determine whether the Laplace Transform was applied at some earlier time?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention, the historical application of the Laplace Transform doesn't change the linear system's original equations but merely affects the representation. \\( I(t) \\) can directly be traced through the inverse transform function, and the Laplace Transform's application has no irreversible effects on the future evolution of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
