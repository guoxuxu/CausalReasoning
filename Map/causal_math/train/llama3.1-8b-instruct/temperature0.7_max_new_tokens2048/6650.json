  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature dynamics in a reactor is controlled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a rate constant, \\\\(T_e\\\\) is the external temperature, \\\\(T\\\\) is the reactor temperature, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term due to a reaction. The transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) is considered at a time instant to study the impact on the reactor's thermal behavior.\n\nIf the temperature \\\\(T(t)\\\\) is observed at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we conclusively determine whether the initial temperature \\\\(T_0\\\\) was squared or not from the observed temperature alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the differential equation, particularly due to the presence of the external temperature and source term, multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed temperature at \\\\(t = T\\\\). Without additional information about the initial state or the trajectory's specifics, it's impossible to determine uniquely if the squaring transformation \\\\(f(T)\\\\) was applied initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
