  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by the convolution integral \\\\( z(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input function, and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response of the system represented using the Laplace transform as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). We investigate the changes when applying a scaling transformation \\\\( f(x) = kx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) of the initial transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) if an additional intervention \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, without knowing \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the details of the intervention \\\\( g(x) \\\\), it becomes impossible to exclusively attribute the scaling at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to the initial factor \\\\( k \\\\) due to the potential alterations caused by \\\\( m \\\\) in the time-reversed scaling. The superposition and modification of scaling effects complicate direct inference of \\\\( k \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
