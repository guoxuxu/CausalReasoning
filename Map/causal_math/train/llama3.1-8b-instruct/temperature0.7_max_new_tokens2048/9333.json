  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ft}x(t) dt \\\\), where F is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf the state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is set at t = 0 and evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\) for a time interval T without any other intervention, will \\\\( h(x) \\\\) calculated over [0, T] be the same regardless of the control input used?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the integral transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) depends on the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), which in turn is influenced by the control input \\\\( u \\\\). Different control inputs lead to different state trajectories, thus affecting the value of \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
