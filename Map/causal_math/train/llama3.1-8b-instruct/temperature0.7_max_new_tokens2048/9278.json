  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nGiven the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and the value of A, assuming no interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "While we can recover the magnitude of the initial vector and the difference in angle due to the rotation by \\\\( A \\\\times T \\\\), multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and the initial argument could lead to the same resultant vector at time T due to the periodicity of rotations in the complex plane (every \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
