  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace transform of its input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), giving \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\. The output of the system is described by the function \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We examine the effects of modifying the input signal using the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x(t) * e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the original signal \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) after observing the transformed output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), without knowing whether transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, and given that the output depends on the altered Laplace transform \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\), it is impractical to uniquely back-calculate to the original \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), especially without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
