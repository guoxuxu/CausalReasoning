  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) defined over time, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We investigate the role of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), representing an integral transformation.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another transformation, say the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\), is performed at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the nature of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the original Laplace transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) alters the course of the dynamical system's evolution. The resulting function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) would depend both on the initial conditions set by the Laplace transformation and the changes brought by the Fourier transform, as they may modify the frequency and decay properties of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
