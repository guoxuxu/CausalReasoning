  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nProvided with the endpoint y(T), can we determine the matrix A used, assuming an intervention may have changed it to A', without knowing B and u(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint y(T) results from a complex interaction between the matrix A (or A'), the matrix B through control inputs u(t), and the initial state y_0. Without clear knowledge of B and u(t), isolating the effect and determining A or A' from the endpoint y(T) is not feasible due to the integral influence of multiple variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
