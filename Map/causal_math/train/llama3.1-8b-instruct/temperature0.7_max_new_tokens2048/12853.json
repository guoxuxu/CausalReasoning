  "Problem": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of a substance \\\\( C(t) \\\\) evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a reaction rate constant. We analyze how applying a transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) affects the system over time.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( C(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if the transformation \\\\( f(C) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 purely based on \\\\( C(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) at t = 0 does not permanently change the concentration but reverses itself instantly, there are no remaining effects by T and thus \\\\( C(T) \\\\) appears as if no transformation was applied at all.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
