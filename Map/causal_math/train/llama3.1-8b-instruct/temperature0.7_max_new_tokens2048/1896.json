  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of a system governed by a matrix equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a matrix with eigenvalues. To study this system, a transformation \\\\( z = T^{-1}x \\\\) is applied, where T is a transformation matrix, converting the system to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Jz \\\\) with J being the Jordan form of M.\n\nCan we determine all elements involved (initial matrix M, transformation matrix T, intervention matrix N) accurately by observing only the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) reflects an outcome influenced by both the original system dynamics and any interventions, like the switch to matrix N. Due to the potential for overlapping effects (multiple matrices could yield similar behaviors) and lack of reversibility in such transformations, it is not feasible to uniquely identify all components solely from the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
