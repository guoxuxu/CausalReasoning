  "Problem": "Let's consider the linear functional transformation \\\\( F(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a fixed but unknown function. We explore the consequences of applying \\\\( F(g) \\\\) to different functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) under continuous and piecewise mappings.\n\nIf the output of \\\\( F(g) \\\\) is observed for a given \\\\( g(t) \\\\), without further details about \\\\( F \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we precisely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the output of \\\\( F(g) \\\\) without specific details about \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\), due to potential generality and multiple possibilities in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) that could produce the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "observing output of F(g) → knowing g(t); knowing g(t) → assuming f(t) is fixed; assuming f(t) is fixed → F(g) is defined; observing output of F(g) → assuming f(t) is fixed; assuming f(t) is fixed → F(g) is defined"
