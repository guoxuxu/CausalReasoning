  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\), where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant complex vector. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transformation given by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIf the vector \\( x \\) is transformed by \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( z(t) \\) is subsequently subjected to the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) without further intervention, will \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) depend only on the matrix \\( A \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\), which is fundamentally linked to the matrix \\( A \\), will be determined by the structure and properties of \\( A \\) after transformation. Specifically, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}x \\), indicating dependence solely on \\( A \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
