  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the response of a complex system under the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) while iterating through scenarios of system modification or the imposition of a boundary condition.\n\nKnowing the transformed state at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we conclusively detect the point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the value of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) introduced as an intervention solely by observing the alteration in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interaction and the nature of exponential multiplication in the frequency domain, multiple combinations of intervention points \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and values of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) can lead to similar alterations in the transformed state, making precise identification infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
