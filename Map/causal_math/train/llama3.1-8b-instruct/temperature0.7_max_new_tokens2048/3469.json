  "Problem": "Consider a complex integration scenario described by a contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) around a closed path C in the complex plane, where \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to analyze the integral in terms of real time dynamics.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) in the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is increased, without any intervention, does this lead to a significant change in the value of the contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\(a\\\\) directly modifies the exponential part of the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\), which alters the growth rate and behavior of the integrand along the contour C. This change will affect the residues at the poles and consequently the value of the integral due to changes in the exponential decay or growth rate, as influenced by the Laplace transform properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
