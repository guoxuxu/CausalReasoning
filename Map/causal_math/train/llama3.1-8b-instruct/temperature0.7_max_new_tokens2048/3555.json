  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\( x_1 \\\\) within [0, a], an intervention modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) again to a different function \\\\( h(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( y(a) \\\\) depend solely on the last intervention and not on the initial application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( y(a) \\\\) results from the complete history of changes in \\\\( u(x) \\\\), including the effects from both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and the new intervention \\\\( h(x) \\\\). This is because each segment of the function affects the behavior of the integral from its point of application onwards.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
