  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nCan the original function at t = 0 be precisely deduced after observing the function at t = T, without knowing n or whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the power n or application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the original state cannot be reliably inferred from the observed state at t = T; multiple values of n could lead to different initial states through the transformation, affecting the frequency and phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
