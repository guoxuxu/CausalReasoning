  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex number. We are exploring how the function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) impacts z over time t, where Q is another complex number.\n\nBased on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively identify which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution process, just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be reached through different combinations of transformations due to the overlapping effects of the exponential transformations on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This overlap and possible equivalence in outcomes make it difficult to distinctly identify the specific transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
