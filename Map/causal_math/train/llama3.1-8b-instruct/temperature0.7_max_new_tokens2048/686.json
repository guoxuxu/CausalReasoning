  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation defined by the operator \\\\( L(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without information about whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial vector in a way that is irreversible solely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of Q. Multiple scenarios could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the possibility that different transformations have equivalent effects over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
