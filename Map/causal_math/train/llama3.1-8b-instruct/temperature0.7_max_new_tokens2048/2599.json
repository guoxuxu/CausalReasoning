  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( n \\\\) is a non-negative integer. We investigate causal relations by manipulating this function with and without interventions in the complex function plane.\n\nIf a modification is made to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) by introducing a damping factor, \\\\( e^{-bt} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a real number, does \\\\( H(s) \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\), disregarding \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new parameter \\\\( b \\\\) into \\\\( h(t) \\\\), modified to be \\\\( h(t) = t^n e^{(a-b)t} \\\\). The transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) changes to \\\\( \\\\frac{n!}{(s-(a-b))^{n+1}} \\\\), indicating that \\\\( b \\\\) significantly influences the Laplace transform result, affecting the dependence on original parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
