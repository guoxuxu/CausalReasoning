  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with a function transformation defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x t^kf(t) dt \\\\) where k is a constant and f is a differentiable function. The impact of the linear operation transformation \\\\( L[z(x)] = \\int_0^x z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, x].\n\nSuppose a modification by a function \\\\( g(t) = t^m f(t) \\\\) (where m is a constant) is applied as an intervention during the computation of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), will the result of \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) by scaling and possibly altering the integrand's behavior due to the power of t (m), which affects the ultimate outcome of subsequent integrations in \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\). This scaling changes the distribution and magnitudes within the integral, thereby affecting the final result significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
