  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda+i\\omega)t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) are real constants representing growth and oscillation parameters respectively. We will explore the impacts of applying a Laplace transform to this function and its inverse.\n\nGiven \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda - \\gamma + i\\omega)}\\\\) after an unknown intervention, can we accurately state that the only change made to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) was the introduction of a damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\gamma t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Other transformations resembling a damping factor could potentially manufacture similar offsets in \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) within \\\\(Z(s)\\\\). For example, a shift in time or changes in the growth parameter by an additive constant would result in similar transformations in the Laplace domain, obscuring the identity of the specific intervention used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "intervention → change in Z(s); Z(s) → z(t); λ → Z(s); ω → Z(s); γ → Z(s); change in Z(s) → z(t) → e^(-γt); λ, ω, γ → e^(-γt)"
