  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the state of a system z(t) is transformed by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-iB)s} z(s) ds \\\\), where A and B are matrices, and i is the imaginary unit. This system's behavior under temporal evolution is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z(t) \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention at time t_1. Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, only depend on the linear evolution through C and not be affected by the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or the intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces a new layer of transformation, compounded by the earlier application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Both these alterations, alongside the natural evolution dictated by C, shape the trajectory to the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent on A, B, C, and D, defining a path influenced by each transformation's properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
