  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\(\\{ z(t) \\}\\) that maps complex numbers onto a complex plane. The function is defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could result from various combinations of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\theta \\) values, influencing magnitude and phase respectively. Due to their independent effects and the lack of commutation in their functional forms, it's impossible to determine uniquely from \\( z(T) \\) alone whether one, both, or other combined interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
