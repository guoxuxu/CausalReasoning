  "Problem": "Consider a continuous dynamical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The transformation is defined by \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is altered by multiplication with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) at t = 0, and then the Laplace transform is applied without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( U(s) \\\\) be the same as that obtained from the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform shifts the original transform \\\\( U(s) \\\\) to \\\\( U(s-a) \\\\). This results in a transformation where the function is evaluated at different values of \\\\( s \\\\), changing the outcome of the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
