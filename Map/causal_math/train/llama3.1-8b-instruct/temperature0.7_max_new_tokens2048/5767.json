  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional phase shift is introduced, transforming the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta) t} \\\\) for some constant \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\), and then the Fourier Transform is applied, will the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) remain a single peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift modifies the frequency of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\). Thus, the peak in the Fourier Transform spectrum shifts accordingly to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\). The spectrum will not contain the peak at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but instead at the altered frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
