  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied, the scaling by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) might have changed \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by an exponential factor, which we cannot uniquely determine just from observing the position at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
