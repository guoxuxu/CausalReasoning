  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf a deformation \\\\( D \\\\) of path \\\\( C \\\\) in the complex plane is applied, leading to a new path \\\\( C' \\\\), will the integral value \\\\( \\\\int_{C'} e^{az} dz \\\\) remain unchanged from the original \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral depends explicitly on the path in the complex plane due to the nature of the complex exponential function and its dependency on the path's start and end points. A deformation can change these bounds, thereby potentially altering the value of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
