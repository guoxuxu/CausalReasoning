  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a time-varying admittance matrix \\\\( Y(t) \\\\), and a network described by the voltage-current relationship \\\\( I = Y(t)V \\\\). We examine the impact of a transformation represented by the matrix function \\\\( P(t) = e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, that affects the voltage vector over time.\n\nGiven the current vector \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial voltage vector \\\\( V_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to reconstruct the initial \\( V_0 \\) uniquely because the transformation could have modified \\( V_0 \\) by an exponential factor (e.g., scaling, rotating), which directly affects the resultant \\( I(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
