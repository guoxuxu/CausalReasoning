  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nGiven an observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved to time T, can we definitively trace back to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the initial condition, it's impossible to ascertain if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from a transformed or untransformed initial state due to the exponential transformation potentially changing initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
