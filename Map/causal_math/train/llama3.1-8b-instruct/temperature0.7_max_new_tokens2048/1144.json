  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + K\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(K\\\\) a constant. We analyze the effect of employing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on \\\\(u\\\\), defined by \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), examining how it evolves in the transformed domain.\n\nGiven the Fourier domain status \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\), can we determine exactly which interventions (initial Fourier transform, application of \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), or both) took place, by only observing the final transformed state?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions such as initial transformations or mid-process modifications like filtering from the final state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) is inherently problematic due to potential overlap in effects and a lack of information on phase or other hidden parameters. Multiple possible initialization and intervention scenarios might yield the same or indistinguishably similar transformed states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
