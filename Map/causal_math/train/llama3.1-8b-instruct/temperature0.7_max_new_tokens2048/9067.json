  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a vector function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x \\\\, dt \\\\) over a time period T, where A is a square matrix. We examine the changes induced by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(x) = Ex \\\\) (where E is another constant matrix) is applied at a certain time during the evolution, will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) depend only on matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of transformation \\\\( k(x) = Ex \\\\) as an intervention modifies the path of evolution halfway, affecting the integral's result. Therefore, the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends not just on A, but also on E and the interaction between E and A applied during the second half of the integration period.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
