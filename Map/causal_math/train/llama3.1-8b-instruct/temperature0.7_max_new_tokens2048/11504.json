  "Problem": "Consider a function represented by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We explore the effects of this function in the context of integral transformations on the complex plane, specifically using the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nCan we determine the specific interventions applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) solely by analyzing the final integral expression \\\\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential complex interactions between the transformations and their localized effects near singularities or within the contour, the final integral form alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were applied or their sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
