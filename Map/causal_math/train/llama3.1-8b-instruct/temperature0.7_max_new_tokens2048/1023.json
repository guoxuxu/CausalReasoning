  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is a different constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original transformation and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another exponential factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on A (from the original transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) but also on B (from the intervention). The endpoint will incorporate effects from both transformations, affecting both magnitude and phase, and thus cannot be predicted solely based on the original transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
