  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function impacts a linear system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), with D being a constant matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention is made by changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and given that the system continues according to \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) only depend on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) will depend on both the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the altered frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\). The effects of the initial segment of evolution under \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can still influence the system's trajectory even after changing to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
