  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region \\\\(R\\\\). We study the behavior under a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and analyze the system's response over a boundary \\\\(S\\\\) conditional on a function \\\\(v = e^{kt} u\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u \\\\) at the boundary \\\\(S\\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the transformed boundary values \\\\( F(u)(S) \\\\) at a later time still satisfy the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator, and since the Laplace equation is linear, the transformation of a solution is also a solution. Therefore, the transformed boundary values will satisfy the Laplace equation over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
