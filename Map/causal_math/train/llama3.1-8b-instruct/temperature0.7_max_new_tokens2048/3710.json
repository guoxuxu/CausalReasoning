  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. For analysis, we apply a Fourier transform to change the domain from time to frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\), which converts the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) into its frequency-domain counterpart.\n\nGiven the function in the frequency domain \\\\(F_x(\\\\omega)\\\\), can we unambiguously reconstruct the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) without knowledge of the original conditions used in the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, under ideal conditions and assuming no information loss during transformation, is invertible. This means that knowing \\\\(F_x(\\\\omega)\\\\) allows the exact reconstruction of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform, independent of initial conditions being explicitly known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
