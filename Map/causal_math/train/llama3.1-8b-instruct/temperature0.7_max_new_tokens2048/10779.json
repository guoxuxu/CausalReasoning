  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where T is a specific time point greater than zero.\n\nSuppose that at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional matrix exponential transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{(B-A)t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention. Will the endpoint at time T depend solely on the properties of A and not on the new matrix B?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( h(z) \\\\) as an intervention alters the trajectory set by the initial conditions and subsequent transformations. The final state at time T will depend not only on A but also on B, considering the additional exponential effect introduced by the new matrix, which modifies the path and contributions initiated by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
