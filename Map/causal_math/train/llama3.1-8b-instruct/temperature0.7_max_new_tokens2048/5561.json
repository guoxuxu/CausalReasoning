  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore how the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}f(z) \\\\, dt \\\\) affects causal inference.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) is applied at initial time with the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time T be solely determined by \\\\( M \\\\) and initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T[f] \\\\) introduces a modification to the evolving state via the non-linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) under integration, creating dependency on the initial condition squared and how this interacts with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\). Hence, the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the nature of \\\\( f \\\\) and its interplay with the exponential matrix as well as \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
