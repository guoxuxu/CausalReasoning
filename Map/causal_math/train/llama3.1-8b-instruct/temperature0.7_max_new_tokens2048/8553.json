  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nIf the system starts with initial conditions \\\\(x(0) = x_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt}(0) = v_0\\\\), and no external force \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is applied, will the motion of the system at time T be described solely by the homogeneous solution to the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the external force, the system's motion is governed only by its inherent properties (p, q) and initial conditions (x_0, v_0), leading to a solution that can be represented as a combination of exponential and sinusoidal functions intrinsic to the homogeneous differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
