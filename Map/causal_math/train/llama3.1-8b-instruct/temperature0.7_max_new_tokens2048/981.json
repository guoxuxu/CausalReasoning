  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is replaced by \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\) in the transformation, will \\\\( F(z) \\\\) for a fixed \\\\( z \\\\) and contour \\\\( C \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( g(s) \\\\) was unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( g(s) \\\\) to \\\\( g(s)h(s) \\\\) changes the integrand and therefore the result of the integral transformation. The new function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) can alter the characteristics of the integral, leading to a different computed value of \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
