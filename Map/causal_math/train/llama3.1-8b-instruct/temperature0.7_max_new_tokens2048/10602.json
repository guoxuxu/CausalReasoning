  "Problem": "Consider the influence of an external magnetic field B on a particle with charge q and the trajectory described by the vector position function \\\\( r(t) \\). Assume the magnetic field introduces a force per unit charge represented by the vector function \\\\( F(t) = qv(t) \\\\times B \\), where \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is the velocity vector of the particle at time t and \\\\times denotes the cross product.\n\nCan the initial velocity vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be uniquely determined from the position \\\\( r(T) \\\\) at a later time T, without intervention but in the presence of the magnetic field?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the magnetic field on the particle's motion depends on the initial velocity's orientation relative to the field. Without distinct direction data or initial conditions, multiple initial velocities could yield the same final position after interaction with the field.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
