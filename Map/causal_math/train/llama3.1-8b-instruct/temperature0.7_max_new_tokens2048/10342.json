  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = f(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time and solve the integral equations \\\\( x(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)}g(x(s)) ds \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}h(y(s)) ds \\\\). We will analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( Tz = Cz \\\\) at different points in time.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) if no information about the application of \\\\( C \\\\) at the start is given?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether or how \\\\( C \\\\) was applied initially, it is impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the potential influence of \\\\( C \\\\) on the trajectories of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The dependency on initial conditions and potential transformations leads to multiple possibilities for \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\).",
