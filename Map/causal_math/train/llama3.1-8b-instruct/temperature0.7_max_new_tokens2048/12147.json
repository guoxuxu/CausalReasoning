  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\), within a certain region. Consider a transformation by the function \\\\(f(u) = e^{ikx} u\\\\) where k is a constant and x represents a spatial variable.\n\nGiven the observed function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) at some point x, can we determine precisely if any transformations were applied (either \\\\(f(u)\\\\), \\\\(g(u)\\\\), or both), just by analyzing \\\\(u(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of transformations such as \\\\(e^{ikx}\\\\) or \\\\(e^{-ikx}\\\\) could produce similar effects depending on the spatial regions and the characteristics of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\). These transformations might nullify each other or modify the function in complex ways, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied from the observed function alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "observed u(x) → Laplace equation; Laplace equation → transformation by f(u); transformation by f(u) → f(u) = e^{ikx} u; f(u) = e^{ikx} u → k; k → x; transformation by f(u) → g(u); observed u(x) → g(u); g(u) → g(u) = e^{ikx} u; g(u) = e^{ikx} u → k; k → x; transformation by f(u) or g(u) → no transformation by f(u) or g(u); no transformation by f(u) or g(u) → precisely determine transformations; precisely determine transformations → answer to the question; answer to the question → k and x"
