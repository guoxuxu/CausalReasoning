  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional linear dynamical system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with M being a 2x2 constant matrix. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another 2x2 constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or neither) during the evolution, solely based on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or even without them, depending on the properties of the matrices D, F, and M. The overlap in potential state transformations makes it impossible to identify precisely which interventions occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
