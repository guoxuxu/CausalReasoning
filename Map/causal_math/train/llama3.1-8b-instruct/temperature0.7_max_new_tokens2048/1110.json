  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system undergoing forced vibration governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = F(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) is the damping ratio, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency, and \\\\(F(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) represents external periodic forcing. We explore the consequences of applying a transformation through convolution with an impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\zeta\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nGiven the system's response \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the exact form of the original forcing function \\\\(F(t)\\\\) without knowing whether a convolution was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the convolution application, the influence of the damping-like effect introduced by \\\\(h(t)\\\\) on \\\\(F(t)\\\\) cannot be reverse-engineered solely from the end response due to loss of information about the original periodicity and amplitude of the force.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
