  "Problem": "Consider a vector field \\( V \\) in a complex domain, represented as \\( V(z) = u(z) + iv(z) \\) where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are real-valued functions of the complex variable \\( z \\). We examine the situation where an integral transform \\( T \\), particularly the Laplace Transform, is applied to \\( V \\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\( T(V)(s) \\) after some interventions, can we determine definitively the nature of the interventions (the function \\( h \\) or others) applied to \\( V \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\( T(V)(s) \\) could potentially be achieved through different interventions or combinations thereof. The overlap of possible transformed states due to different functions \\( h \\) and inherent properties of the transform mean one cannot uniquely back-calculate the interventions from the final transformed state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
