  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional transformation subject to the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)) when applied to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\\\\\\\, where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace Transform (\\\\( L \\\\)) to the ODE, then solve the resulting algebraic equation and finally apply the Inverse Laplace Transform (\\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)), will the solution precisely match the original solution of the ODE without applying \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming an ODE with \\\\( L \\\\) and then reversing it with \\\\( L^{-1} \\\\) after solving it algebraically keeps the system's integrity intact. The processes of Laplace and Inverse Laplace Transforms are designed to preserve the characteristics of the differential equation, ensuring that the solution is consistent with the original ODE.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
