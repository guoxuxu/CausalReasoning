  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\( c \\\\) is a fixed complex constant. This function is related to iterative mappings used in fractal generation like the Mandelbrot set. We investigate how initial values and transformations influence the resulting behavior after multiple iterations.\n\nGiven the sequence behavior (whether bounded or unbounded) at the end, and knowing that the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was used intermittently, can the original value of \\\\( c \\\\) and the specific points where \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied be precisely inferred?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at unknown points introduces variability in the phase without affecting the modulus. This makes it challenging to back-calculate to the original \\\\( c \\\\) value or to determine precisely at which iteration steps \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, as the overall boundedness property driven by the modulus remains consistent regardless of the rotations introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "sequence behavior → g(z) was used intermittently; initial value of z → sequence behavior; c → sequence behavior; g(z) was used intermittently → c; g(z) was used intermittently → initial value of z"
