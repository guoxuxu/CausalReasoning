  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a series of transformations including a Fourier Transform followed by a linear filter represented by a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then an inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nIf the signal is transformed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) during the Fourier Transform, and no further modifications are made, will the resultant signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) directly reflect the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without any influence from external factors?",
  "Explanation": "Since the only transformation applied to the signal in the frequency domain is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the resultant signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after applying the inverse Fourier Transform will directly reflect the characteristics and modifications imposed by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The process is linear and time-invariant, so external factors absent any further intervention do not alter the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
