  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nGiven the convolved function resulting from \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), can we perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over the complex plane without prior knowledge of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and given the irreversibility of convolution with a non-invertible kernel such as a Gaussian, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the convolution result. Intrinsic ambiguities arise due to the loss of information during convolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Convolution → Fourier Transform; Fourier Transform → Inverse Fourier Transform; Inverse Fourier Transform → Reconstruction of f(z); Convolution → Blur of f(z); Blur of f(z) → Difficulty in Reconstruction of f(z); Fourier Transform → Knowledge of f(z) is not required; Knowledge of g(t) → Difficulty in Reconstruction of f(z)"
