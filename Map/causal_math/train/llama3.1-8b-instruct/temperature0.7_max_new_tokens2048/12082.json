  "Problem": "Let's consider a continuous system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) specifies the system's response behavior. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform on this system, with the Laplace transform defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) = U(s)\\\\).\n\nIf a perturbation defined by a multiplication by \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha x}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a scalar) is added into the system at time \\\\(t = t_0\\\\), will the resulting system described in the Laplace domain be entirely independent of the original \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) parameter?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a spatial perturbation of \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha x}\\\\) modifies the differential equation, now containing terms dependent on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). However, in the Laplace domain, the transformation interacts with the original parameter \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), resulting in a combined effect that still encapsulates the influence of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
