  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a continuous function on the interval [0, T], and s is a complex scalar. We are interested to determine how transformations to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) like \\\\( f(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is another continuous function, impacts the resulting function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we know the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and are informed that it's from the integral involving \\\\( e^{sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), can we determine the specific function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex variable s and the infinite possibilities for the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), merely knowing the final value of the integral \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not allow us to definitely determine the form of \\\\( f(x) \\\\), as different functions can produce the same integral value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
