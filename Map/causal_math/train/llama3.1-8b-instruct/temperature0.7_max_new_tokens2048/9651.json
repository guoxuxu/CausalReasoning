  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable. We explore how the system behaves under different conditions when applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(t) = t^2 x(t)\\\\) and assessing the impact of this change across various scenarios.\n\nIf a new intervention function \\\\(k(t) = e^{-t}x(t)\\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the Laplace transform at a complex variable \\\\(s = c + di\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) depend only on the original transformation and not on the intervening function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(k(t)\\\\) modifies the system by introducing an exponential decay factor, affecting both the time-domain representation of the signal and its Laplace transform for times greater than \\\\(t_1\\\\). The resulting Laplace transform will be dependent on the interactions between both the original and intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
