  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate how applying different integral kernels, like \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and transformations, impacts the result of the transformation.\n\nGiven the modified transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), is it possible to identify precisely what changes were applied to the transformation kernel (original or modified by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\)) by analyzing only \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modified function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) may exhibit similar properties to other transforms created by different modifications (e.g., scale or shift in the s-domain). Without explicit knowledge of the change in the integral kernel, it's impossible to uniquely determine the specific modification applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s → e^(-st); t → ∞; t → f(t); s → F(s); e^(-st) → F(s); f(t) → F(s); a → e^(-at); e^(-at) → modified transformation kernel"
