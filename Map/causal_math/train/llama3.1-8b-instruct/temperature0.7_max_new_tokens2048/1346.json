  "Problem": "We postulate a scenario involving the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t) \\) and its effect when used in conjunction with an integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, applied to a function \\( h(t) \\) that represents a physical system's response.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function, originally the result of some convolution with \\( \\delta(t) \\), can we retrieve the original function \\( h(t) \\) without knowing its initial form?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform can be applied directly to recover the original function \\( h(t) \\). Since convolution with \\( \\delta(t) \\) faithfully preserves the original function, retrieving \\( h(t) \\) remains straightforward and independent of its convolution with \\( \\delta(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
