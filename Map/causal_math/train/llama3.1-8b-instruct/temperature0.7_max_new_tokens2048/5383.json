  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). Let us examine the causal effects and inferences in systems characterized by convolution and multiplication operations in the Laplace domain leading to end solutions in time domain.\n\nIf an external function \\\\( p(t) \\\\), transforming to \\\\( P(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, is applied to modify \\\\( g(t) \\\\) during convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), does the transformed outcome in the Laplace domain solely depend on the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and modified \\\\( G(s)P(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output, now represented by \\\\( H(s)G(s)P(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, is directly influenced by the new input \\\\( P(s) \\\\) as well as the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and modified \\\\( G(s) \\\\). This represents the linear and direct impact of convolution and multiplication transformations in the Laplace domain according to the convolution theorem and properties of linear systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
