  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\), and then analyzed for different values of \\\\( s \\\\) without further transformation, will \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) be affected by the value of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which clearly shows dependence on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\). The outcome of the integral transformation is directly influenced by the complex exponential component introduced by \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
