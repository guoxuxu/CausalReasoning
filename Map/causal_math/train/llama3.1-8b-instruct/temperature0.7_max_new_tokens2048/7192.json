  "Problem": "Examine the implications of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), with D as a constant matrix, upon inclusion of a linear operator mapping \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix applied intermittently.\n\nGiven knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to explicitly determine the specific interventions made (be it \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both), by knowing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ultimate state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could arise from different combinations of applications of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\) along with natural evolution. The non-commutativity and differential effects of the matrix exponentials can create overlapping scenarios that cannot conclusively determine the specific interventions unambiguously.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
