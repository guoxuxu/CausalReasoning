  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), can we necessarily deduce the specific path C used in the absence of other information?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( g(w) = e^w \\\\) does not uniquely determine the path C because any contour integral over paths not enclosing or crossing singularities or branch cuts will yield the same result due to the nature of \\\\( e^w \\\\) as an entire function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
