  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at some time T, can we reconstruct the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves an integral with a complex exponential which may lose information about the initial phase and frequency changes over the interval. This loss of information prevents exact reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
