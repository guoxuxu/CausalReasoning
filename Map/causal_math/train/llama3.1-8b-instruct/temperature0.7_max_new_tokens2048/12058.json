  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process characterized by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real constants representing decay/growth rates and oscillatory behavior respectively. We explore the consequence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on the process.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U(z) = z(t)e^{-ct} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant, is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) before continued integration, does the final integrated value \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) purely reflect the initial parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(z) \\\\) affects the process by altering the exponential term's decay rate, introducing \\\\( c \\\\) into the dynamics. Thus, the final integrated value \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) will reflect the effects of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and the intervention \\\\( c \\\\), altering the expected result based on alone \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
