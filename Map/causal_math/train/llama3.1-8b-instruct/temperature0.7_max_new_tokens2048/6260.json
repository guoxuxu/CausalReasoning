  "Problem": "In a region within a complex plane, consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time. The region has a transformation applied by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which performs a Laplace transform on these functions.\n\nCan we accurately determine the specific sequence or type of transformations (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\), or both) applied to reach the endpoint \\\\(Z(T)\\\\), solely from observing \\\\(Z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multifaceted influences that integral transformations can have on functions in the complex plane, and without specific details about the intervention timing and characteristics, it is infeasible to uniquely backtrack the sequence of transformations from the output. Overlapping effects and the potential non-linearity of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\) add complexity to inferring a precise history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
