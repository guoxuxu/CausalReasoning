  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be dependent solely on the natural dynamics and not on the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) further complicates the trajectory in addition to any earlier application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Both \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) contribute distinct complex exponential growths, affecting both magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus impacting the final position at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
