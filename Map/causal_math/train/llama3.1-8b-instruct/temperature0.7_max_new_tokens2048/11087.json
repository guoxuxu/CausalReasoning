  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effects of applying Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as its inverse and interactions due to various potential modifications.\n\nIf after performing the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(z) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\), an additional filtering operation represented by multiplication with a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) in the s-domain is applied, will the final inverse-transformed function reflect only the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\) characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an extra filtering operation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by convolution in the time-domain upon taking the inverse Laplace Transform. The final function would represent a blend or modified version of the original function, influenced by both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the filter's characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
