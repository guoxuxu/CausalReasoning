  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nIf during the evolution under \\\\( g(z) \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) is applied at a specific instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final outcome \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) be influenced entirely by \\\\( C \\\\), regardless of \\\\( m \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) adds another layer of transformation. The final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( C \\\\) but on how \\\\( z \\\\)'s trajectory is further altered by \\\\( z^m \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This intervention disrupts the straightforward influence of \\\\( C \\\\) alone, reflecting compounded effects of \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
