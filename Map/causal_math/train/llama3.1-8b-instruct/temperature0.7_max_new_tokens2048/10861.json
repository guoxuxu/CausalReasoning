  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nIf u(t) is set as the zero function from t = 0 onwards and no interventions are applied, will y(t) at t = T solely depend on the initial condition y_0?",
  "Explanation": "With u(t) = 0, the integral term becomes zero, causing the output y(t) to depend only on the term \\\\( e^{At}y_0 \\\\). Therefore, y(t) at any time T is solely a function of the initial state y_0, dictated by the matrix exponential of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
