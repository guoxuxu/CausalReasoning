  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nIf an additional condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\) for some fixed y_1 is introduced as an intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) throughout the domain still be predictable solely based on the original boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y_1) = k(x) \\\\) modifies the problem setup and consequently alters the solution throughout the domain. The system now depends on both boundary conditions, not just the initial one at \\\\( y = 0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
