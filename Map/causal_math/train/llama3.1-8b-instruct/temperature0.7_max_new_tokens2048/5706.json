  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field V(x) and analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax + b \\\\) where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We study the particle's motion in different cases with and without transformations using the operator \\\\( e^{Lt} \\\\), where L is the Liouville operator for the system.\n\nCan we determine the original position of the particle at t = 0 after observing its position at t = T if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), due to its altering of the initial conditions, recovering the exact original position is obscured. The transformation can change position and momentum in a way that Hamilton's equations alone cannot revert uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
