  "Problem": "Explore a system governed by a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z(0) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and consider the effect of a distinct transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex matrix. Analyze the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under various conditions and transformations.\n\nSuppose a function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention at time t1. Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 be influenced solely by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), irrespective of matrices \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, combining with the effects of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) hence results from the interplay among \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( F \\\\). The transformations induced by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) during their respective intervals play substantial roles in defining the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), due to their cumulative effect on the evolution of the state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
