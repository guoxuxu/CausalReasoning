  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), to the function u(t).\n\nCan we deduce the function \\\\( u(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\) and knowing the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) without calculating the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature of the operator L and assuming L has an appropriate inverse or propagator, we can uniquely reconstruct \\\\( u(0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(T) \\\\) using the inverse operation of L. The Fourier transform does not need to be specifically invoked for this deduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
