  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a function \\( u(x) \\) represented as \\( T[u(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{st} u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of changing the order of integration and differentiation operations under the transformation.\n\nIf \\( T \\) is applied to a function \\( u(x) \\), and \\( u(x) \\) is left to evolve under its natural properties without further intervention, will the derivative \\( \\frac{d}{ds} T[u(x)] \\) reflect only the characteristics of \\( u(x) \\) at any point \\( s \\) in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative \\( \\frac{d}{ds} T[u(x)] \\) involves both the characteristics of \\( u(x) \\) and the interaction of \\( s \\) with \\( u(x) \\) through the integral and exponential components, which means it's not solely representative of \\( u(x) \\)'s natural properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
