  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\) represented by matrix \\( M \\), and its impact on a complex function \\( z(t) \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}v \\), where \\( v \\) is a constant vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) and \\( \\omega \\) a real number. We explore how the application of Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) and its subsequent inverse alter the original function.\n\nCan the original vector \\( v \\) be uniquely determined from observing \\( z(t) \\) at any given t > 0, without knowing if \\( T \\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\( T \\) alters \\( v \\) to \\( Mv \\), the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}v \\) changes, making it impossible to retrieve \\( v \\) without additional information about \\( M \\) since \\( e^{i \\omega t}Mv \\) could correspond to multiple potential original vectors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
