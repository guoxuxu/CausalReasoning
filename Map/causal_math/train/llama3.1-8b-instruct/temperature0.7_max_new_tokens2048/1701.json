  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We study the implications of a Laplace transformation given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) on this function over the complex variable z.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform, will the outcome \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) solely evaluate the exponentials involving A without considering the transform variable s?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform integrates the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) with the exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\), which fundamentally intertwines the effect of both s and A on the transformed result. The outcome cannot be understood just in terms of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
