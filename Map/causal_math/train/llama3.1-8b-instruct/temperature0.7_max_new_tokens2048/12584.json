  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), noted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\). We examine how convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), whose Laplace transform is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system over time.\n\nIf a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) creating a new function \\\\( f(t) = (g * h)(t) \\\\), and the system evolves under this new function without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} \\\\) at a future time T correspond to the product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem of Laplace transforms states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions in the time domain is the product of their Laplace transforms in the frequency domain. Thus, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will equal the product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\), reflecting the compound effect of both functions without any change over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
