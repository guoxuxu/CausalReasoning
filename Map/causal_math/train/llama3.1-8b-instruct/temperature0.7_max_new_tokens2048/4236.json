  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time system represented by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( u(s) \\\\) a varying vector function of time. Study the effect of applying a temporal shift transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{B\\tau}u(t-\\tau) \\\\), with \\\\( \\tau \\\\) a time shift constant and \\\\( B \\\\) another matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely what sequence and type of interventions (\\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or both) were applied, based solely on the output value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the changing input conditions affected by the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials and transformations and overlapping effects of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), the final value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\) cannot provide definitive evidence of specific interventions or their sequence. This ambiguity stems from the complex interaction between transformations and the integrative process governed by \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
