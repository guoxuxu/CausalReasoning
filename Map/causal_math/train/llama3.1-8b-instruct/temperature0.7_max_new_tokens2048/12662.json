  "Problem": "Consider a scenario wherein we have a Hilbert space and a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined on this space. The function \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to any function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) in the space, and then the operator operates on \\\\( h(f(x)) \\\\). Furthermore, we consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and check how applying this transform affects the linear operation.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied as an intervention before applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\), will the final outcome depend only on the action of \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) changes the characteristics of the function, potentially affecting how the operator \\\\( L \\\\) impacts the function. Both the original squaring function \\\\( h \\\\) and the Fourier transform play significant roles in shaping the final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
