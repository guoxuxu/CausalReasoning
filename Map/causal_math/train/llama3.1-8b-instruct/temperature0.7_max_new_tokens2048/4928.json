  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of complex functions, where each function obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. We explore how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}u(x)dx\\\\), influences the solutions.\n\nKnowing only the resulting function after back-transformation, can we determine both the original function form and the exact intervention applied in the frequency domain using the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "While we can confirm that the function remains a solution to the differential equation, the exact form of the original function and the specific intervention applied (such as the value of \\\\(a\\\\) in the exponential shift) cannot be uniquely determined without additional initial or boundary value information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
