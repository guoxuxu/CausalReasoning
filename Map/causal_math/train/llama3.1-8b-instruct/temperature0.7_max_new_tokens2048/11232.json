  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) in relation to a linear transformation system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We will inspect the impact of applying transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t on the evolution of the function z(t).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly what transformations (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple transformations via matrix exponentials result in a non-unique set of potential initial conditions and interventions. As matrix exponentiations generally do not commute, and their effects are not readily separable, it is challenging to pinpoint precisely which transformations were applied to reach \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
