  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int e^{At} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is a scalar function. This setup explores how changes in \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( f \\\\) influence the behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention adjusts \\\\( f(s) \\\\) to a new function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) after some time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) solely depend on the properties of \\\\( A \\\\) and not on the previous form of \\\\( f(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The contribution of \\\\( f(s) \\\\) to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) before \\\\( t_0 \\\\) still influences the overall function past \\\\( t_0 \\\\), despite the intervention. Thus, the final form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) depends not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but also on the historical effects of \\\\( f(s) \\\\) and the new effects introduced by \\\\( g(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
