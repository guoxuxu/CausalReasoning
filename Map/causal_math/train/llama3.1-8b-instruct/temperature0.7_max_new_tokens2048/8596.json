  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nCan we determine whether the transformed function was originally \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\), based purely on observing the inverse transform result of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing an inverse transform result of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-2} \\\\), which corresponds to \\\\( e^{2t} \\\\), does not allow us to distinguish between an original function that was directly \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or modified with \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) since additional transformations or operations might have been applied before or after the transformation affecting the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
