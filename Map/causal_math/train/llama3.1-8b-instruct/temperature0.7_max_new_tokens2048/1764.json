  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, under the application of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). We analyze how interventions by multiplication of a complex exponential factor affect causal inference in this complex waveform scenario.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we uniquely ascertain whether an intervention happened and distinguish between effects of \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output in the s-domain after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on the intervention-modified \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i(w+\\\\theta)} \\\\). While the sum \\\\( w+\\\\theta \\\\) is apparent from the pole, distinguishing between the specific contributions of \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is not feasible, as multiple (w, \\\\theta) pairs could yield the same sum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
