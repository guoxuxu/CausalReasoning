  "Problem": "In a statistical framework, consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = X\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon \\\\), where \\\\( X \\\\) represents predictor variables matrix, \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) a coefficients vector, and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the error terms. We are examining the effect of a simultaneous linear transformation applied to both \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) through matrix \\\\( T \\\\) which affects the causality from predictors to response.\n\nIf, after applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), an additional external manipulation modifies \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\) at a certain point, does this affect the response \\\\( z \\\\) solely based on the new \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\), independently of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The external modification of \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\) post-transformation adds another level of change that directly influences \\\\( z \\\\), not only through the new \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\) but also how this modified \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\) interacts with the transformed \\\\( X' \\\\). Consequently, the impact on \\\\( z \\\\) is contingent upon both the nature of \\\\( T \\\\) and the new form of \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
