  "Problem": "Consider a system where a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where A is a constant complex number. The function influences the trajectory over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the system then evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\), where B is another constant complex number, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be equivalent to simply evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\) for the same duration?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) initially modifies \\\\(z_0\\\\) into \\\\(e^{At}z_0\\\\), changing the starting point of the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Bz\\\\). This difference in initial conditions generally leads to a different trajectory and endpoint, dependent on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
