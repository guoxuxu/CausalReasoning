  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) with boundary conditions. We explore the system response under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) and consider the dynamics when impacted by an operation \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}\\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention using \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect solely the properties of the original PDE without considering \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the transformed state, influencing its evolution by introducing an additional phase shift dependent on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). This modification affects the resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\), making it dependent not only on the original PDE but also on the intervention applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
