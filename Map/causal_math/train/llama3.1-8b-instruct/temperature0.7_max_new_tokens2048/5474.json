  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nAfter observing a time-domain signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) obtained from an inverse Fourier transform of a filtered spectrum, can we perfectly reconstruct the unaltered original signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the applied filter?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the details of the frequency components removed by the filter, it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the original signal since the high-frequency details lost during filtering are irreplaceable. Hence, perfect reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the altered \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
