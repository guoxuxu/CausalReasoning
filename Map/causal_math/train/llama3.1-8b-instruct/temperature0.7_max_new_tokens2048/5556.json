  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = p(t) \\\\cdot z' + q(t) \\\\cdot z \\\\) where \\\\( ' \\\\) denotes the derivative with respect to t, and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are time-varying coefficients.\n\nKnowing \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) after some interventions were applied during the evolution, can we determine exactly what operations (either \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) were applied at which times only from \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without direct knowledge of the interventions' specifics (types and timing), the outcome \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) observed at T does not uniquely specify the operational sequence. System overlap, the interdependent effect of the operations, and lack of commutativity between applied transformations result in multiple possible histories leading to the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
