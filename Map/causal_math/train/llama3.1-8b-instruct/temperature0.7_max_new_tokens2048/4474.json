  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in terms of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), such that \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a positive real constant. Analyzing the effect of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant. Observations are made over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) with certainty if we don’t know whether function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the system's behavior as \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) gives \\\\( e^{iAT}z_0 \\\\) only under conditions of no intervention. If \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) would rather be \\\\( e^{i(AT+BT)}z_0 \\\\). Not knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was carried out, we face ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as either \\\\( e^{-iAT}z(T) \\\\) or \\\\( e^{-i(AT+BT)}z(T) \\\\). This introduces uncertainty without additional data on the presence or absence of intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
