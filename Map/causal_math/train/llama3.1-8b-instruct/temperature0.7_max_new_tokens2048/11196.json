  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = Y(s)\\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is the original time function. To examine any causal changes, an impulse response function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(y(t)\\\\) resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = h(t) * y(t)\\\\). The frequency responses of \\\\(h\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are denoted by \\\\(H(s)\\\\) and \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), respectively.\n\nAssuming we observe \\\\(G(s)\\\\) after the intervention at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we accurately determine whether the changes resulted from \\\\(H(s)\\\\), \\\\(K(s)\\\\), or both, based solely on \\\\(G(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of multiple convolutions involving \\\\(H(s)\\\\) and \\\\(K(s)\\\\) cause a compounded transform in \\\\(G(s)\\\\), which cannot singularly attribute changes to \\\\(H(s)\\\\) or \\\\(K(s)\\\\) without additional information about the timing or specifics of each intervention, reflecting the convolutional ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
