  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function represents a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane. We examine the response of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming no initial conditions.\n\nGiven the transformed function post-intervention \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we determine precisely when the intervention \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform provides information about the shift in the system's dynamics, it does not intrinsically provide temporal data about when the intervention occurred. The transform indicates the presence and effect of an exponential damping but lacks specific temporal resolution without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
