  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how the convolution of another function, \\\\( h(t) \\\\), impacts g(t) in terms of their transforms. Assume both functions are well-behaved and their transforms exist.\n\nIf an additional transformation, represented by the function \\\\( f(s) = s^2 \\\\), is applied to the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before convolution, will the final Laplace Transform of the convolution still be a mere product of the transformed \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( f(s) \\\\) before convolution modifies the original transform. Consequently, the product rule for Laplace Transforms under convolution fails as the Laplace Transform of g(t) no longer remains simply \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\), but becomes \\\\( s^2 \\\\times L[g(t)] \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
