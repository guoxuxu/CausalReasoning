  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), is it possible to distinguish whether the changes in the system were due to the original source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\), an addition of \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\), or modifications in the boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The observed temperature distribution at \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) is the result of the cumulative effects of diffusion, original source terms, potential additional source terms, and boundary condition modifications. Deciphering which factors specifically contributed and in what manner from the end result is generally impractical without further detailed information, due to the overlapping influences and the linearity of the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
