  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), known as the wave equation. We explore the influence of a Fourier transform applied initially (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\)) and how it impacts the propagation of the wave over time.\n\nIf an additional transformation, let's say a Laplace transform (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)\\\\)), is applied at a later time t_1, will the system's state at time T > t_1 solely depend on the original wave equation without considering the effects of the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a Laplace transformation as an intervention modifies the system's evolving state further by altering its spectrum in complex plane, and thus the state at any later time T will depend on the interplay between the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform, and the inherent dynamics prescribed by the wave equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
