  "Problem": "Analyze a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct} z \\\\) over time t, with C being a constant matrix, is considered.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be the result of various combinations of the transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), affecting the real and imaginary components in overlapping ways. The complexity of the system's dynamics and potential for different path trajectories depending on the interventions and their timings make it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
