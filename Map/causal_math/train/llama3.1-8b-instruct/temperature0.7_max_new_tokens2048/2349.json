  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nIf a signal \\( x(t) \\) is transformed to \\( X(f) \\) and then processed by \\( H(f) \\) to produce \\( y(t) \\), will the resulting \\( y(t) \\) be a mere convolution of \\( x(t) \\) with the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(f) \\), assuming the system remains linear and time-invariant?",
  "Explanation": "In a linear and time-invariant system, altering the signal in the frequency domain via \\( H(f) \\) equates to convolution in the time domain with the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(f) \\). This results in \\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\), where \\( h(t) \\) is the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(f) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
