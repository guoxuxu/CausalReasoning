  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are variables transformed via integral transformations applied as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\) using the Laplace transform. The transformed function is expressed as \\\\( Z(s) = F(X(s), Y(s)) \\\\). We analyze how these transformations affect the relationships and dependencies between the original functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) transformations are defined without any intervention, does the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = F(X(s), Y(s)) \\\\) reflect the exact causal relationship of \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) from its originals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The causal relationships in the time domain may not be preserved in the Laplace domain due to the transformation properties. Changes such as convolution becoming multiplication may alter the original dependencies and interactions between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
