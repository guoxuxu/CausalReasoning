  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z(0) = x + y \\\\) evolves under the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz + iBy \\\\) without any intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if the system followed a different rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iA'z + iB'y \\\\) with A' and B' being different from A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is uniquely determined by the matrices A and B. Changing A and B to A' and B', alters the frequencies and phases of the rotations, leading to a different trajectory and hence a different state at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
