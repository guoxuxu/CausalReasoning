  "Problem": "Imagine a physical system that can be modeled by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a region. Consider interventions performed using a boundary condition modification where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) on part of the boundary is altered using a function \\\\(h(t, x)\\\\), which is timedependent.\n\nIf the boundary condition is set to a fixed function \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\) and no further interventions are made, will the solution \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) at a later time t depend only on the initial boundary condition \\\\(h(0,x)\\\\) and not on time?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further boundary interventions occur and the equation is time-independent (Laplace's equation), the solution \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) in the domain will remain static after its initial determination from \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\). The solution follows from the initial boundary condition and isn't affected by time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
