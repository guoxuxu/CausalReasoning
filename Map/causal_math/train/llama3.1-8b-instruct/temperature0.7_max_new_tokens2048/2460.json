  "Problem": "Consider a closed system involving a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole. The input signal is \\\\( x(t) = e^{st} \\\\). We study the system's behavior under Laplace transforms and analyze the effects of introducing an interrupting signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the step function.\n\nKnowing the output after intervention with \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), is it possible to discern whether the initial signal was \\\\( e^{pt} \\\\) or another exponential of a different rate?",
  "Explanation": "Post-intervention knowledge of the output does not provide sufficient information to untangle the specific form of the original exponential input or its parameters from the effects imposed by the interrupted signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\). The superposition from multiple exponentials and overlap in transformative effects muddle the causal backtracking.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "p → H(s); x(t) → H(s); y(t) → H(s); H(s) → output; p → x(t); y(t) → x(t); H(s) → output after intervention; output → discernibility of x(t)"
