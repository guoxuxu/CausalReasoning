  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{Nt}x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which results in a different trajectory. The solution will differ due to the exponential transformation by N, impacting the state at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
