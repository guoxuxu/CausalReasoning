  "Problem": "Consider a system where the behavior of a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time is determined by its Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\. Suppose we apply the inverse Laplace transform after manipulating the function in the s-domain by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\).\n\nIf we modify the function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the s-domain by an additional function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at a certain s-value after the initial application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the resulting time-domain function \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) be independent of the initial multiplier \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) will depend on both transformations \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) because the sequential application of these functions in the s-domain creates compounded effects that manifest in the time-domain behavior and cannot be decoupled.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
