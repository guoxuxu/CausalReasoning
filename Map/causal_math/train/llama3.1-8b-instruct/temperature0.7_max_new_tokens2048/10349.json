  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf no modification is made and the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based solely on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) for some time T, will the transformed state after applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) remain the same as the original state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the complex function via integration. It accumulates all prior states transformed by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which ultimately results in a different outcome compared to just evolving the state under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
