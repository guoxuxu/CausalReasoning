  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nCan we precisely identify the nature of the intervention \\( Q(D) \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\) by analyzing \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) at \\( T \\), knowing only the initial operator \\( P(D) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential interventions \\( Q(D) \\) could lead to equivalent modifications in \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\), especially if \\( P(D) \\) and \\( Q(D) \\) are not uniquely distinguishable in their effect on the frequency spectrum. Without additional information, it is impossible to unambiguously determine which \\( Q(D) \\) was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
