  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), with \\( M \\) being a complex matrix. Investigate how the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), affects the dynamics of \\( z(t) \\), where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we explicitly determine the specific modifications (changes from \\( M \\) to \\( M' \\)) made during the evolution, solely based on the endpoint \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention from \\( M \\) to \\( M' \\) based only on \\( z(T) \\) is challenging without additional data. Different interventions can lead to similar endpoints due to the complex interactions and dependencies influenced by the matrices and the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
