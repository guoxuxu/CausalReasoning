  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) is applied to a complex variable z, where A is a complex constant. The effect of this transformation over time, modeled by \\\\( z(t) = f(z(t-1)) \\\\\\), is assessed with and without interventions.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\\\), where B is another complex constant, will the spiral's nature (tightness, direction) depend on both values of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the dynamics of the system. The new function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will change the rate and direction of rotation and scaling in accordance with the real and imaginary parts of B. As a result, the overall behavior of the spiral over time will depend on both A (before the intervention) and B (after the intervention).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
