  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, often represented as \\\\( a = b + ci \\\\). We examine how the function responds to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and we analyze situations both with and without interventions defined by multiplying by another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - b - ci} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), specifically identifying both \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform clearly encodes both the real and imaginary components of \\\\( a \\\\) in its denominator. This allows for the exact reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) = e^{(b+ci)t} \\\\) by identifying \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) from the transform function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
