  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the system is modified by adding a constant \\\\( C \\\\) to parameter \\\\( A \\\\), will this intervention ensure that \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 is solely determined by the new value of A?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( C \\\\) to \\\\( A \\\\) alters the exponent in the integral but doesn't remove the influence of past values of \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) or A before \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The output current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still reflects the composite influence of both the original and altered A values up to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
