  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nGiven the modified time-domain function after an unknown filtering operation in the frequency domain, can we precisely determine the original unaltered function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the filter \\\\( h(w) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the filter \\\\( h(w) \\\\) used in the frequency domain, multiple combinations of original functions and filters can result in the same modified time-domain output, rendering it impossible to definitively separate and identify \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(w) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
