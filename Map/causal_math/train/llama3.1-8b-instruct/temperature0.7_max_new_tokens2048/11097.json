  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\\\( g(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) dx \\\\) over the input function u.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, does the outcome at time T solely depend on the operator L applied to the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transform \\\\( g(u) \\\\) alters the input function by integrating it against a decaying exponential, which changes its form. Therefore, the evolution under L from this modified initial state leads to a different outcome at time T compared to just evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under L.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
