  "Problem": "We explore a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions represented by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. We investigate the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( L{z(t)} = F(s) \\\\) on z(t).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then inverted without any modifications or external influences, will the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be exactly recovered?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are theoretically perfect in recovering the original time-domain function when applied consecutively under ideal conditions. This presumes no modifications to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and that all conditions meet requirements for existence and uniqueness of the transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
