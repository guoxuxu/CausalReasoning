  "Problem": "Consider a function space influenced by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and consider the integral transform \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} K(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transform. The challenge is to assess how transformations and inverses of these operators affect the functions within this space.\n\nGiven the final output after subsequent transformations by \\\\( T \\\\) and then \\\\( M \\\\), is it possible to determine explicitly what the initial function and modifications were (both by \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplicative and potentially non-commutative effects of multiple operators, particularly in complex function spaces, generally preclude the ability to specifically ascertain the initial state and exact nature of operations (both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\)). The resultant state could potentially be achieved through different paths with different initial functions and operator characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
