  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of an inductor and a resistor in series, subjected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The mathematical model is governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a sinusoidal source voltage. To investigate the response, we apply a Laplace transform on the system.\n\nGiven the end point s-domain representation \\\\(I(s)\\\\) at some time T, can we determine precisely whether a varying resistance was involved or whether \\\\(V(t)\\\\) was the only influencing factor, only by analyzing \\\\(I(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The altered current response \\\\(I(s)\\\\) will encode combined effects of both the original voltage and any resistance changes. These elements may influence the system’s dynamics in overlapping ways, making it impossible to disentangle the effects and clearly attribute them to either varying resistance or the voltage source alone without additional context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "V(t) → I(t); I(t) → dI/dt; dI/dt → L*dI/dt; L*dI/dt → RI; RI → I(s); I(s) → V(t) or R; R → I(s) or V(t)"
