  "Problem": "In the context of electrical circuits, consider a linear system represented by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The system is subject to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and produces output \\\\( y(t) \\\\). We explore the effect of a Laplace transform on this system, focusing on the transfer function modification \\\\( H(s) \\\\) changing to \\\\( H(s) + K(s) \\\\), where \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is another transfer function.\n\nIf the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is altered by adding \\\\( K(s) \\\\), without other interventions, will the new output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) influenced by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through \\\\( H(s) + K(s) \\\\) be the same as the original output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) influenced by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( K(s) \\\\) to the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) changes the system's response characteristics, resulting in a different output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) for the same input \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The characteristics of \\\\( K(s) \\\\) (e.g., poles and zeros) can significantly alter the time-domain response of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
