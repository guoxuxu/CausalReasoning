  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a system of linear differential equations. Let \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be the voltage at a given node, represented by the linear relationship \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = MV + NU \\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(U(t)\\\\) represents external inputs like currents. Analyze the effects of applying an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, to the inputs.\n\nGiven the voltage response \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at a later time t, can the original input form \\\\( U(t) \\\\) be exclusively determined without knowing the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the Laplace Transform to the input, multiple potential input functions could result in the same observed output, especially considering possible modifications of input in the frequency or s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → V; N → V; U(t) → V; V → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → U(t)"
