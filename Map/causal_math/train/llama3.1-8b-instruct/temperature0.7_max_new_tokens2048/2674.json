  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) describing the evolution of a function u(x,t) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes u(x,0) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) and its impact on the solution space.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial function u(x,0) after obtaining \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > 0 from the Fourier transformed space, without knowing whether a transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial transformation, accurate reconstruction of u(x,0) is compromised. The Fourier components evolve differently under L, and if unaccounted for, the inversion to physical space can lead to inaccurate or ambiguous reconstructions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
