  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of a system governed by a matrix equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a matrix with eigenvalues. To study this system, a transformation \\\\( z = T^{-1}x \\\\) is applied, where T is a transformation matrix, converting the system to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Jz \\\\) with J being the Jordan form of M.\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after evolution, is it possible to uniquely determine the Jordan form \\\\( J \\\\) and transformation matrix \\\\( T \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple Jordan forms and transformation matrices can represent the same linear transformation depending on the basis chosen. Without knowing the specific transformation matrix or additional constraints, \\\\( J \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
