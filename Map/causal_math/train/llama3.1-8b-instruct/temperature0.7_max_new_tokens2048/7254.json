  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system wherein time-series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a convolution with a kernel function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(\\\\tau)h(t - \\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). We explore the impact of the Laplace Transform on this convolution and its causal inference under several scenarios.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the output signal \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) \\\\), and knowing the kernel's transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\) is invertible, then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) / \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\). This operation is valid under typical conditions where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is known and invertible in the Laplace domain, allowing us to deduce \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from the transformed output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
