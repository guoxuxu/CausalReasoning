  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nIf at some time t_1 a modulation m(t) is applied to the system as an intervention, changing the original impulse response to h'(t), will the output y(T) for T > t_1 still be predictable solely based on the original H(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's response properties by altering the impulse response from h(t) to h'(t). As such, the output y(T) will depend on the new modified response characteristics and cannot be predicted solely based on the original H(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
