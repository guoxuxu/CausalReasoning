  "Problem": "A system is defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the system's behavior under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) where B is another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the evolution of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) generates a new function by integrating the modified states influenced by the exponential term \\\\( e^{iB(t-s)} \\\\), which can significantly alter the trajectory and final state at time T compared to simple evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
