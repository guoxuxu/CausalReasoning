  "Problem": "Consider a system of equations governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is applied to this system resulting in the transformed function \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) at s = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x(s) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) introduces an integral dependency on the history of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) from 0 to t. As such, the evolution of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) affects \\\\( u(t) \\\\) differently than just evolving \\\\( x(s) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), leading to potentially different results at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
