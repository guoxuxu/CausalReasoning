  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nIf a manipulating function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing the distribution according to \\\\( u'(x, t_1) = u(x, t_1) + h(x) \\\\), and the system continues to evolve by the heat equation, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be unaffected by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a modification to the temperature profile at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which affects the subsequent distribution due to the heat equation's nature to spread and equalize temperature variations over time. The evolution of \\\\( u'(x, T) \\\\) will depend on both the initial conditions and the modifications introduced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
