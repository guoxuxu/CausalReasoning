  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx + Mu\\\\), where L and M are constant matrices and u represents control input. Let's explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}x dt\\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, followed by the natural evolution of the system under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx + Mu\\\\) without any intervention, will the output \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at any time t be identical to the scenario where \\\\(x_0\\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx + Mu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) would result in an integral of the exponential transformation applied to \\\\(x_0\\\\), which alters the state from its original trajectory. This modification changes the initial state and thus disrupts the system's natural evolution, leading to a different output at any time t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
