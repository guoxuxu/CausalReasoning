  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real constant and t is time. We will analyze scenarios pertaining to a Laplace transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the final form of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) \\\\), can we definitively determine the times or nature of interventions (change from A to B)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap of effects due to e^{iAt} before t1 and e^{iBt} after t1 leads to a transform that combines influences of both A and B, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact time or the specific intervention (A or B) solely from the Laplace transform result. The effect of the entire function history contributes to the final transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
