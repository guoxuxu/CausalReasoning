  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) based on a fixed complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number. This dynamic is influenced by performing different integral transformations on \\\\( z \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing the final state of \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) for some \\\\( T > t_0 \\\\), can we reliably infer the specific transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) used, based solely on the ending condition?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects and the complex transformation properties, multiple different combinations of \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint under the complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Therefore, identifying the specific interventions from the endpoint alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
