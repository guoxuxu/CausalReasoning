  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( z \\\\) a complex number. A Fourier transform transformation \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the transformed function, making it \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We will explore the implications of modifying the power \\\\( n \\\\) and the transformation's effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) = at^n \\\\) for some constant \\\\( a \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\) affects the amplitude and potentially the spread of the transformed function. Both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\) influence the final form of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), thus the contributions are not determined by \\\\( n \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
