  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output y(t) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial t} = Py(t) + Qu(t)\\\\), with P a differential operator and Q a control influence operator. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on the system's behavior, particularly focusing on the impact of control function u(t).\n\nGiven the transformed system output \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))\\\\) at some s in the complex plane, can we infer the exact control signal u(t) used initially, assuming no further information about P and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))\\\\) is influenced by both the dynamics imposed by P and the control introduced through Q. Without explicit knowledge about how these operators work or their specific forms, an exact inference of u(t) merely from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))\\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
