  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit characterized by its complex impedance \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + R \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is the resistance, \\\\( C \\\\) is the capacitance, and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable from the Laplace transform. We explore the effects when the input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( f(V) = e^{at}V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the current response \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at a particular time, can we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(V) \\\\), \\\\( g(V) \\\\), or none), by solely observing \\\\( I(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The variability introduced by the exponential transformations' parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) and the possibility of their non-trivial overlay makes it extremely challenging to uniquely decode the interventions from the endpoint current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) alone. The interactions influenced by these transformations can yield similar effects on the current for different combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), making unique identification infeasible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
