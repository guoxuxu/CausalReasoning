  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing oscillations influenced by a damping constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\). The function is transformed using the Laplace transform, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan determining the formula for \\\\( F(s) \\\\) allow us to conclusively deduce the value of the damping constant \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) used in the original real functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "While the structure of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) provides clues about the behavior of the damping in the oscillations, it does not uniquely determine \\\\(\\lambda\\\\), because the same Laplace transform can result from different pairs of functions under different damping scenarios, particularly in complex conjugates or similar constructs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
