  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the frequency domain, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then transformed by the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), taking place over a duration T.\n\nIf an additional phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi)} \\\\), will the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) after this intervention be non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a phase shift changes the properties of the integral. Depending on the value of \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), the result of the integral may no longer conform neatly to zero as phase shifts modify the start and end points of the integral, potentially leaving a residual complex vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
