  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nAfter applying \\\\( T(w) \\\\) to the transformed points, is it possible to reliably infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely from the resulting value of the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) fundamentally changes the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), reconstructing the original function from the integral's result is nontrivial without additional information. The impact of the complex exponential transformation complicates the inverse operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
