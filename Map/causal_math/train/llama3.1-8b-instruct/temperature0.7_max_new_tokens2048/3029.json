  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then let it evolve without further transformations, will the result at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if we directly evaluated \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without using \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}e^{i\\\\omega s}ds = t \\\\), a constant factor is introduced equivalent to the length of the interval considered. Therefore, in a continuous framework without boundaries or further transformations, the evolution preserves the original behavior scaled by the interval length, essentially equivalent to evaluating \\\\( z(T) \\\\), noting the linear time scaling.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
