  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the Laplace transform \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are uniquely determined by the location of the pole in the s-domain. Given this Laplace transform, the pole at \\( s = a+bi \\) directly gives the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
