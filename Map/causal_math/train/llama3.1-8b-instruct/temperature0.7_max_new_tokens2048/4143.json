  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be purely governed by the original equation without being affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further complicates the evolution, introducing additional growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\beta (T-t_1)} \\\\). Hence, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both the effect of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) from \\\\( h(z) \\\\), alongside the natural evolution due to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). As such, the determination of the state at \\\\( T \\\\) must consider all three parameters, making the trajectory and final state a result of this composite influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
