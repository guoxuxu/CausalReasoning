  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model with complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex number. We explore the effects of the Laplace Transform on this function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\), to transform from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace Transform, then evaluated at a specific point s in the complex plane, can we assume the transformed function will have the same behavior as \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the time domain without any alterations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform modifies the function into a new domain, focusing on frequency components rather than time evolution. The behavior and properties of \\\\( f \\\\) in the frequency domain under \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) can fundamentally differ from its behavior in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace Transform → Has a transformed function; z → Complex number; Applying Laplace Transform → Has a specific point s in the complex plane; Has a transformed function → Has same behavior as f(z); f(z) → Has a time domain; f(z) → Has a specific behavior"
