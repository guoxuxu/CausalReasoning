  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is transformed via Laplace transformation and this representation is evolved according to the rules governing the transformation, will the resulting \\\\( s \\\\)-domain representation at a point \\\\( s \\\\) correspond to the evolution of the original state through \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) is \\\\( s\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} - z(0) = i\\\\omega \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), solving this gives us the Laplace transform of the evolved state directly from the transformed initial condition, thereby preserving the dynamics equivalently in the \\\\( s \\\\)-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
