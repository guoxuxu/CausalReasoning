  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can you conclusively determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have altered \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a way that modified how the differentials evolved over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
