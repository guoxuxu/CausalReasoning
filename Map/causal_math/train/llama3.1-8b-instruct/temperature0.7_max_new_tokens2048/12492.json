  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA}x(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is an input function. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, on the input function over time.\n\nIf the transformed input \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is used from t = 0 without further intervention, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from that produced by using \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly under the integral equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) alters the characteristics of the input function, thus changing the integrand from \\\\( e^{-sA}x(s) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-sA}e^{Bs}x(s) \\\\. The presence of both exponentials entails complex interactions between matrices A and B which generally result in a different output function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at any given time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
