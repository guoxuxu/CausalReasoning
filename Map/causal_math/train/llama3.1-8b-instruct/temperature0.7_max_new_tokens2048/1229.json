  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt} z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix, is applied at a specific time interval.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied after allowing the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve from t = 0 to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without any intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) reflect the simple integration of the initial function form \\\\( e^{Pt} z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) includes the property of matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) which modifies the integration process, making the result dependent both on Q and P matrices, thus altering the outcome from a simple integration of \\\\( e^{Pt} z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
