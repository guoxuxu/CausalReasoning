  "Problem": "Consider a function space transformation governed by integral transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a function in time domain and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. Analyze the effect of applying the inverse Laplace transformation on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and compare it under different variations of function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a modification function \\\\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) (where c is a constant) is applied to \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\) before transformation, will the Laplace transform of the new function depend only on c, and not on the original form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) = t \\\\) results in \\\\( t e^{ct} \\\\), which when transformed by Laplace, gives \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\\\). This result depends explicitly on both the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the parameter c, indicating dependencies on original and modification functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
