  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function transformation on a real function g(x) over the domain [0, 1]. The transformation is defined by T(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(iπsx) g(s) ds, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at some point in the interval, say x = 0.3, an additional transformation U defined by U(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(i2πtx) g(t) dt is applied, will the resultant function at x = 1 depend only on the initial form of g and not on the applied transformations T and U?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations T and U apply complex functions to interact differently with g over the interval. The final value at x = 1 is influenced by how these transformations interplay, especially given their dependence on different frequencies in their exponential terms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
