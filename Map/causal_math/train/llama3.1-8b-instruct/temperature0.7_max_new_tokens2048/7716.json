  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing the output of a system where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(t-\\\\tau)A}Bu(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal with B a constant matrix and A a linear operator. Analyze the impact of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) to the signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to determine whether a Laplace transform was applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) just by analyzing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the application of a Laplace transform strictly from the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the multiple possible configurations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that could give the same output once processed by the system's dynamics. The transform's effect blends with the system's response, obscuring direct inference of its application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
