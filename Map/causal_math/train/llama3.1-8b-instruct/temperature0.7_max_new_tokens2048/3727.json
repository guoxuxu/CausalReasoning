  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nIf at some frequency domain point \\\\( s_1 \\\\), a network operation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, affecting \\\\( V(s) \\\\) before it interacts with \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) for s > s_1 depend solely on H(s) and not on G(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The network operation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) modifies the input voltage, which changes how \\\\( V(s) \\\\) interacts with \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Thus, the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) depends on both the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the introduced function \\\\( G(s) \\\\), reflecting the combined effect of both operations on the circuit's response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
