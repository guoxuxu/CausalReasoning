  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at a precise moment \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), an action such as multiplying by a new function \\\\(h(z) = z + e^{it_1}\\\\) is introduced, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) and not on the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or the intervention \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint would depend on both the initial transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) and the intervention \\\\(h(z)\\\\). Each contributes distinctly to changing the path and the final form of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making the outcome depend collectively on these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
