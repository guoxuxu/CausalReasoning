  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is a function in time. This model explores the transformation of x(t) into z(x) over a period T, focusing on its impact in a linear system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Bx \\\\).\n\nCan the original function x(t) be determined exactly from \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without knowing A?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) integrates x(t) using \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which obscures direct information about x(t) due to the irreversible integration process and the dependency on A. Without knowing A, retrieving x(t) from \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is not feasible as the influence of A on the transformation cannot be inverted uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
