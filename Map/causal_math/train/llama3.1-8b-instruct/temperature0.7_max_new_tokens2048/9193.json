  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ruled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2 \\\\), where A and B are constants. We investigate the impacts of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which changes the ongoing state trajectory due to the non-linear term \\\\( Bz^2 \\\\) in the differential equation. The initial modification deeply affects the outcome at t = T because the non-linear dynamics amplify any initial changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
