  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to z before computing \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\) depend only on the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without influence from the path of z?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) significantly alters the input to \\\\( g \\\\), which in turn changes how the integral evaluates. Since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) specifically integrates \\\\( e^{iu} \\\\) along a path to z, squaring z generally modifies this path geometrically and can affect the integration significantly across complex domains.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
