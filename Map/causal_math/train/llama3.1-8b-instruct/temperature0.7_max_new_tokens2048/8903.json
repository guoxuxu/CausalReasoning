  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) an intervention function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the ongoing evolution by adding a new influence through matrix \\\\( C \\\\). This new state does not merely depend on \\\\( A \\\\) but also the additional application through \\\\( g \\\\), and the transformation due to \\\\( C \\\\) changes the trajectory and hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
