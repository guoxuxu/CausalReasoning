  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined on the complex plane. We evaluate the responses to integrations involving the complex function and the related impacts given by the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\).\n\nGiven the output at t = 1, can you identify definitively that \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was used as an intervention after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) only based upon the resultant complex number?",
  "Explanation": "The effect at t = 1 can still be identical under different initial conditions and/or sequence of function applications due to the periodic nature of the exponential function and multiplicative properties of squaring in complex numbers. The final state could be achieved by different sequences of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), making it impossible to conclusively identify the exact interventions made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
