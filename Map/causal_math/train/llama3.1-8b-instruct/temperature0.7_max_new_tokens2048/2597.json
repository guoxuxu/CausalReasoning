  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( n \\\\) is a non-negative integer. We investigate causal relations by manipulating this function with and without interventions in the complex function plane.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the behavior and properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) directly reflect the initial properties of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) when considering the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) = t^n e^{at} \\\\) is \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( H(s) \\\\) retains and distinctly reflects the critical parameters of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), specifically the values of \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\), unconditional to any modifications or absence of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
