  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{−λt}(x + iy) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( λ \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed under the application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and time evolution t.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 forming \\\\( L(z_0) \\\\), then allowed to evolve under the given complex function without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly at t = T to the untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( L(z_0) \\\\) introduces a modification in the trajectory from the very beginning, due to constant b in L. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will involve both the effect of the intrinsic decay factor \\\\( e^{−λT} \\\\) and the initial boost from \\\\( L \\\\), differing fundamentally from directly applying \\\\( L \\\\) at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
