  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a complex-valued function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) is applied to a complex variable z in the domain of holomorphic functions, where A is a constant complex matrix. The system is further evolved by the transformation \\\\(g(z, t) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) with B also a constant complex matrix over time t.\n\nAt a midpoint \\\\(t_1\\\\), if another transformation function \\\\(h(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied, will the effect observed at \\\\(z(T)\\\\) be independent from the matrices A and B originally defining \\\\(f\\\\) and \\\\(g\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new matrix \\\\(C\\\\) through function \\\\(h\\\\) means the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is the result of an interplay among A, B, and C. Each matrix's effect compounds over the others due to the sequence of exponential transformations applied to the complex variable, influencing the trajectory and final state in intricate ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
