  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) to this function and its inverse scenarios.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real part positive complex number, and then the function is allowed to evolve in the transform domain without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) for \\\\( s > a \\\\) give the original function upon applying the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), given \\\\( a \\\\) with a positive real part, is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), and applying the inverse Laplace transform correctly recovers the original function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\). There is no modification in between the transformations, hence the procedure reverses itself perfectly under ideal conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
