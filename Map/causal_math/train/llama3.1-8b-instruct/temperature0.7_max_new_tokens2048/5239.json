  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t1 where \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend solely on the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) introduces an additional rotational effect governed by matrix C. This new effect changes the subsequent trajectory and makes the state at time T dependent not only on A and B but also on C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
