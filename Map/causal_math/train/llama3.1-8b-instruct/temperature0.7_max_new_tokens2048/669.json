  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. Explore the effects of applying a transformation matrix \\\\(T\\\\) to both sides of the equation, resulting in \\\\(T(Ax) = Tb\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to change the system to \\\\(T(Ax) = Tb\\\\) at the start, and then the system evolves under the usual rules of matrix operations without further intervention, will the solution vector \\\\(x\\\\) of the transformed system at some time \\\\(t\\\\) be the same as if the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T\\\\) potentially alters the coefficients and the consistent system afforded by equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\). The effect of \\\\(T\\\\) on A can lead to a modified system \\\\(TAx = Tb\\\\) that may have different properties (like rank and kernel) impacting the solution set.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
