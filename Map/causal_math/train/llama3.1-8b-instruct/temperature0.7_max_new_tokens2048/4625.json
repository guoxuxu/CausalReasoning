  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is a pure sinusoidal function of a specific frequency \\\\(\\omega_0\\\\), will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T present a significant response if \\\\(\\omega_0 = \\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) matches the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) of the complex exponential, the integral will capture primarily the component at this frequency, leading to a resultant function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) that exhibits a strong signal at \\\\(\\omega_0 = \\omega\\\\). Due to integral properties with periodic functions of matching frequencies, the output will have significant amplitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
