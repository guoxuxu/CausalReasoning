  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t) \\\\), where P is a complex constant. We study the effects under the integral transform \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt}z(t)dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within \\\\( 0 \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) an intervention \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Rt}z(t)dt \\\\) (where R is a different complex constant) is introduced, will the consequent evaluation by \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\) be influenced by R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( H(z) \\\\) modifies the integral structure and thus changes the information within the system until \\\\( t_1 \\\\), impacting how \\\\( G(z) \\\\) interprets the function from 0 to T. \\\\( R \\\\) affects the aggregation within its applicable interval and inevitably influences the outcome of \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
