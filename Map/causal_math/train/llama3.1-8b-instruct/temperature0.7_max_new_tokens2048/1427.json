  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We are interested in how the application of a Fourier transform affects this function and the consequences of its application on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a phase shift, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the modified function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) alters the phase content of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which impacts its Fourier transform. Thus, \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) representing times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will reflect both the original frequency and the effects of the phase shift intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
