  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where heat conduction through a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature at position \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the temperature at a particular point according to the function \\\\(h(x, t) = e^{−at}sin(bx)\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is introduced at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) along the entire rod, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without any additional intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(t = T\\\\) reflect the same pattern as \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial imposition of \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) changes the initial temperature distribution, but as time progresses, the heat equation tends to diffuse these variations smoothly across the rod, diminishing the initial sinusoidal pattern imposed by \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) due to the exponential decay term \\\\(e^{−at}\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
