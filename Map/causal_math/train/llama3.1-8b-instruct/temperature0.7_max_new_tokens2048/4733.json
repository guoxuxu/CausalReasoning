  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We are curious about the effect of modifying the function f by a polynomial \\\\( p(t) = t^2 \\\\) before applying the integral transformation.\n\nIf the polynomial \\\\( p(t) = t^2 \\\\) is applied to alter the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) (making it \\\\( f(t)t^2 \\\\)) before performing the integral transformation, will the resulting transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be equivalent to the transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( t^2 \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) modifies the original function into a new function where each value t is squared. This alteration affects the integrand significantly, leading to a different output transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) due to the alteration in the rate of decay of the function and the additional t-squared factor under integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
