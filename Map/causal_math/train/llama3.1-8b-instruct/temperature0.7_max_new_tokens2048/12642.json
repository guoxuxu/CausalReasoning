  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf an intervention alters the reaction term from c to a different constant c' at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the Fourier transformed condition \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original parameters D and c?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the reaction term partway through the process affects the dynamics of the reaction-diffusion equation. This modification influences the evolution in the Fourier domain as well, causing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to depend on c', in addition to D and the transformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
