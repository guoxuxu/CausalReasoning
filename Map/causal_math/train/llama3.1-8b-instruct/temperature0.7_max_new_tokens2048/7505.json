  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nIf the transformations \\\\(h_1(z)\\\\) and \\\\(h_2(z)\\\\) are applied sequentially to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) as described, will the final function \\\\(h_2(T)\\\\) at time T be equal to directly applying a single transformation \\\\(e^{(A+B)T}h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of the transformations leads to compositional action which is analogous to exponential addition in the exponents due to the properties of exponential functions in the complex plane, ultimately equating to a single exponential transformation of the sum of constants A and B over time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
