  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = pz + q \\\\), where p and q are complex constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) (where k is a positive integer) and its influence on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{cz} \\\\) (where c is a complex constant) is applied, will the behavior and endpoint of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on p and q, regardless of k and c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor in the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the transformed states through k and the new exponential dynamics added by c, thus it is influenced by all parameters: p, q, k, and c.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
