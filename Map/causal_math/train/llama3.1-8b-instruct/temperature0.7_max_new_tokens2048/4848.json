  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and exploring how its behavior changes when transformed by function \\\\( T_M(t) = Me^{At}M^{-1} \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( \\\\int_0^T T_M(t) dt \\\\) after applying a linear operator L, can we determine if L was applied before or after the transformation \\\\( T_M(t) \\\\) was put in place?",
  "Explanation": "The end result may be similar or identical due to the linear properties of the matrices and operators involved. Determining the sequence of applications (whether L was applied before or after \\\\( T_M(t) \\\\)) cannot be definitively concluded from the end integral alone, as the operations could effectively mask or simulate each other’s effects.\" ",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
