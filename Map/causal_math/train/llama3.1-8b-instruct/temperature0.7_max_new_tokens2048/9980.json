  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) that represents a complex function on the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). For a complex domain transformation defined by \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\), we investigate how this affects the mapping of points over an interval from x = 0 to x = 2\\\\pi.\n\nGiven the final point on the w-plane at x = 2\\\\pi, can we distinctly identify if the path followed was only due to \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) or if the intervention \\\\( v(z) = z^3 \\\\) at x = \\\\pi/2 was also applied?",
  "Explanation": "At x = 2\\\\pi, both transformations lead back to 1 on the unit circle (since \\\\( e^{4\\\\pi i} = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{6\\\\pi i} = 1 \\\\)), making it indistinguishable at the endpoint whether an intervention occurred solely based on the endpoint value. Multiple paths might lead to the same output, all confined to the unit circle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
