  "Problem": "A system is defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the system's behavior under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) where B is another real constant.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (either \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were implemented during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Determining what specific transformations were applied to achieve the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging since both \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) could potentially result in similar or overlapping effects based on their integration and exponential interaction. These effects make it difficult to isolate the influence of either transformation from the observed endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
