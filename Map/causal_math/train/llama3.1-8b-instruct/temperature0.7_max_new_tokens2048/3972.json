  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the resulting function \\\\(w(T)\\\\) after an intervention, can we determine specifically whether a Fourier or Laplace transform (or both) was applied during the interval from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Both Fourier and Laplace transforms fundamentally alter the frequency and time-domain characteristics of a function in ways that could yield the same transformed function \\\\(w(T)\\\\) under certain conditions. Without additional information on the nature and specifics of the intervening transform(s), it is impossible to pinpoint which was applied solely based on the outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
