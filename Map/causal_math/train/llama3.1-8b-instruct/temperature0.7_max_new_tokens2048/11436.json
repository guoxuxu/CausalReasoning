  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) given by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z^t \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the implications of varying the parameter \\\\(s\\\\) in the function and its effect on the transformation of input complex number \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIs it feasible to ascertain whether an intervention on \\\\(s\\\\) occurred during the computation of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) by observing only the final value of \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining if an intervention on \\\\(s\\\\) occurred based solely on the final value of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is implausible. The result could potentially be achieved by different paths involving varied timings and magnitudes of interventions on \\\\(s\\\\), especially given the integral's sensitivity to phase and magnitude changes in its components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
