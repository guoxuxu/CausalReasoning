  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + i v(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), respectively. We aim to explore the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nConsidering that an unknown intervention occurred transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), can we determine directly the nature of the intervention from the altered \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple different time-domain modifications (scaling, shifting, etc.) can result in the same modification in the Laplace Transform domain, without additional context or constraints, it's infeasible to precisely identify the specific time-domain intervention only from \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
