  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving an electrical network with a linear resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit. The circuit's voltage response \\( v(t) \\) across the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{1}{RC}v = \\frac{1}{RC}v_{\\text{in}} \\), where \\( v_{\\text{in}} \\) is the input voltage source and R and C are the resistance and capacitance, respectively. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\} \\) to convert the system into the s-domain making analysis potentially different.\n\nGiven the output \\( v(T) \\), can we determine what interventions were made (whether and when \\( R_2 \\) was introduced) only by knowing the final state \\( v(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing \\( v(T) \\) provides insights on the system state at time T, it doesn't necessarily reveal the history of interventions like the addition of \\( R_2 \\). Multiple scenarios could lead to similar \\( v(T) \\), especially if interventions were temporary or partially reversible. Path dependency and possible multiple solutions obscure direct inference of historical actions from final states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
