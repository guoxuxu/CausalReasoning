  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\beta)t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are real numbers governing exponential growth and oscillation, respectively.\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at time t = 0 affect the system's behavior at any later time t = T compared to if initially \\\\(z_0\\\\) evolved purely under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition by scaling and rotating the vector \\\\(z_0\\\\), thereby altering both the magnitude and phase of the system's trajectory. This leads to different behavior at any later time t = T, due to the additional factors of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
