  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nIf a phase adjustment \\\\( g(\\\\psi) = e^{-iKx}\\\\psi \\\\) is applied at some time t_1 as an intervention, will the final wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) and not on the actions of \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\) at time t_1 modifies the wave function's phase again, potentially cancelling or reinforcing effects from the initial function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\). This interaction makes \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial phase modification by \\\\( K \\\\) and the intervention, alongside the inherently governing dynamics of \\\\( H \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
