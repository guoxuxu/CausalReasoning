  "Problem": "Consider an engineering structure subject to a loading and unloading sequence. Its response is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k u = f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is the displacement, \\\\( c \\\\) is the damping coefficient, \\\\( k \\\\) is the stiffness, and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the external force applied to the system. We analyze the model's behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) u \\\\) over time, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final displacement \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the sequence or types of transformations and interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both), just by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The equation governing the system is sensitive to initial conditions, parameter settings, and external forces. Thus, the displacement at time T can result from different combinations of initial transformations or modifications to the external force. This makes it impossible to uniquely determine the precise interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
