  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time. The function is impacted initially by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) (where A is a complex constant and t is time). We analyze the effect of an operational matrix L of the Laplace transform applied to z(t).\n\nGiven the observed outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain precisely which transformations or interventions (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied by only knowing the resultant transformation at T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) in combination with the operational matrix of the Laplace transform L create complexities that make it difficult to discern precisely which interventions were applied. Multiple combinations of A and B with their respective timings could yield similar or indistinguishable results at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
