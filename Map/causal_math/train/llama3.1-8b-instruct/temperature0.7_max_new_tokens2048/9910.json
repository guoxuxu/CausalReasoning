  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we ascertain the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge if transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the start complicates back-tracing the evolution. Since \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) can alter the magnitude of the initial condition, this unknown scaling factor renders it impossible to uniquely deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
