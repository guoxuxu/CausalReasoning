  "Problem": "Given the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit, we examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nKnowing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{\\hat{z}(t)\\} \\) where \\( \\hat{z}(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\) was applied, can we determine both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( k \\) accurately without ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{\\hat{z}(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega - k} \\), the pole at \\( s = i\\omega + k \\) precisely indicates the combined effect of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( k \\). By separating the real and imaginary parts of the pole, both \\( \\omega \\) (imaginary part) and \\( k \\) (real part) can be uniquely determined.",
