  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can potentially result from different transformation processes or be similarly affected by distinct combinations of transformations due to the nature of integral transforms influencing the solution in various and often overlapping manners.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
