  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) applied to a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), especially focusing on integrating this transform into a control system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is a control input function.\n\nCan we accurately identify all specific transformations (original Laplace Transform and any additional \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u)(s) \\\\)) applied to the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) just by observing the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "Different transformations applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\), such as the Laplace Transform or subsequent \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u)(s) \\\\), can yield overlapping or similar effects on the resulting state trajectory. Without additional context or constraints, it is challenging to uniquely reverse-engineer and identify all specific transformations from the state response alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
