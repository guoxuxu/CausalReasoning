  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{1} e^{tz} dt \\\\) is applied, which modifies subsystem behaviors dynamically.\n\nAfter observing the outcome \\\\( I(Kx_0) \\\\) from the integral transformation, can we definitively determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing about the application of K?",
  "Explanation": "The initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is embedded in a complex transformation under K, altering its nature before the integral transformation. Without precise knowledge of K, back-calculating to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( I(Kx_0) \\\\) would yield multiple potential preimages due to the non-invertibility and information loss within the integral operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
