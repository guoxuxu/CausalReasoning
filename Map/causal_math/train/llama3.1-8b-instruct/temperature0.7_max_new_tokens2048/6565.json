  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real scalar and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex number value. We apply continuous linear transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex number, to this function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nDoes the application of transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) to the initial value \\\\(z_0\\\\) and then letting it evolve under \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) for time \\\\(T\\\\) alter the resultant value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) compared to directly evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\(cz_0\\\\). Thus, the evolution under \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) starts from \\\\(cz_0\\\\) instead of \\\\(z_0\\\\), and at time \\\\(T\\\\), the result will be \\\\(e^{iAT}(cz_0) = ce^{iAT}z_0\\\\), which differs from the unaltered evolution result \\\\(e^{iAT}z_0\\\\) if \\\\(c\\\\) is not unity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
