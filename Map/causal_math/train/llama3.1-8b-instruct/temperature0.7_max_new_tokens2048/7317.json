  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and then the system is evolved based on the eigenfunction expansion without further application of \\\\( F \\\\), will the system at time t = T, represented as \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), be the same as it would be if \\\\( F \\\\) was not applied at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) modifies the coefficients \\\\( a_n(0) \\\\), thereby altering the initial states from which the time evolution begins. This change results in a different configuration at time T since the evolution of each mode is impacted by the initial conditions set by F.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
