  "Problem": "Consider the operation of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where the function describes a physical or mathematical system. We explore how changes in function through multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\) impacts the system.\n\nGiven the transformed function after application of a Laplace transform, can we conclusively determine if the original function was multiplied by \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) prior to transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the nature of the modification (the specific \\\\( s \\\\) used in \\\\( e^{st} \\\\)), it is generally not possible to uniquely trace back and confirm the presence of the exponential multiplier purely from the transformed output, due to potential overlaps in features between different functions and transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → transformed function; multiplication by e^(st) → change in function; change in function → transformed function; original function → change in function; multiplication by e^(st) → original function"
