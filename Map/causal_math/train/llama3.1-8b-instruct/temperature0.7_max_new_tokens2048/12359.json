  "Problem": "Analyze the causal interactions in a system where a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time) undergoes a Laplace transform to generate complex function \\\\( Z(s) = U(s) + iV(s) \\\\). We study the effects and the capability to reverse this transformation.\n\nCan we determine the specific intervention (like convolution with a particular \\\\( w(t) \\\\)) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before performing the Laplace transform, based only on observations of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone is generally infeasible without additional constraints or information about the function \\\\( w(t) \\\\), since multiple different functions \\\\( w(t) \\\\) could result in the same transformed output due to the properties of convolution and Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
