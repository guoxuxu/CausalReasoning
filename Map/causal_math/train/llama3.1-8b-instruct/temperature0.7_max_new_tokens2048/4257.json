  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex function z(t). The functions are related through the Laplace Transform: \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf we know the initial expressions for \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) \\\\), and let them evolve without intervention, will the inverse Laplace Transforms at time t be equivalent to directly evaluating \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) for any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Since no external modifications (or operations) are applied to \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) \\\\), the inverse Laplace Transform of these functions would correctly revert to the original functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). The Lack of intervention maintains the consistency of Laplace transformation and its inverse operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
