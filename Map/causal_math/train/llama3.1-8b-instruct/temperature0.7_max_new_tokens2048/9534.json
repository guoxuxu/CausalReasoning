  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real functions of time and governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. Analyze the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)M}z(s)ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can it be determined definitively whether the transform \\\\( T \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T is not sufficient to uniquely infer if the transform \\\\( T \\\\) was applied because different initial conditions and system parameters (A, B, C, D, M) could potentially produce the same output at t = T without the use of the transform. Hence, knowing the effect alone doesn’t sufficiently reveal the specific cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
