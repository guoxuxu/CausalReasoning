  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) each satisfy the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y \\\\) with different parameters \\\\( \\\\omega_u \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_v \\\\). We explore using a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its impact on interpreting frequency components.\n\nKnowing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain, where we observe broadened frequency peaks due to damping, can the exact form of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) be determined accurately from \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) can indicate the presence of damping due to the broadened peaks, quantitatively extracting the exact value of the damping coefficient \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) solely from these modifications poses a complex inverse problem and often requires additional information, such as initial conditions or other constraints. Peak broadening alone is insufficient for precise determination of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",
