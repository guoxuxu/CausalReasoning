  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint accurately which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied merely by observing the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear interactions and the superposition property of integral and exponential functions in complex systems, multiple configurations of transformations (both \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\)) could lead to the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Hence, it is unfeasible to uniquely determine the interventions used based on the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
