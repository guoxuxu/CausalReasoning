  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a variable transformation using a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) on the integration path in the complex plane. Given a continuous function g(z), we examine the integral transformation from the function \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over a specific path P to \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path.\n\nGiven the integral result of \\\\( \\\\int g(f(h(z)))h'(z)f'(h(z))\\\\, dz \\\\) over path Q, can it be determined if both transformations f(z) and h(z) were applied, just knowing the function g and the final integral value?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interaction between the two transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) altering both path and integrand, similar integral values can be achieved through varying sorts of transformations. Without explicit knowledge of the transformations, it's not feasible to infer which specific transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
