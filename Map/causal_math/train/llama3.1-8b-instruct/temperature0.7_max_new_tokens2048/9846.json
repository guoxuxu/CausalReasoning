  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The impact of this transformation is studied over the path of the unit circle in the complex plane, described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\in [0, 2\\\\pi] \\\\).\n\nIf observing the path of the transformed function over time, can we decide if the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) was applied just by observing the movement on the unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "Observing just the path on the unit circle does not indicate whether the inversion transformation was applied since the unit circle remains invariant under \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Both the transformed and original paths occupy the same set of points, making it impossible to distinguish just by the movement on the path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
