  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if the initial condition was directly evolved in the transformed domain under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{F}(Lu)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) under \\\\(L\\\\) followed by a Fourier transform is equivalent to evolving \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) under the transformed operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(L)\\\\). The commutativity of the Fourier transform with linear differential operators ensures that transforming first and then evolving gives the same result as evolving first and then transforming.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
