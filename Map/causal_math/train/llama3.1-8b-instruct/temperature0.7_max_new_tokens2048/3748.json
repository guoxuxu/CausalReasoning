  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of a fluid flow which density ρ at a point (x, y, z) in space varies over time. The flow is defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. An intervention is modeled by a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(-kt) \\\\), with k being a positive constant.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\), \\\\( h(\\\\rho) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed endpoint \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of interventions and initial conditions. The exponential factors introduced by either \\\\( g(\\\\rho) \\\\) or \\\\( h(\\\\rho) \\\\) or both affect density in such a way that different initial conditions and intervention parameters might yield the same final density, making it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
