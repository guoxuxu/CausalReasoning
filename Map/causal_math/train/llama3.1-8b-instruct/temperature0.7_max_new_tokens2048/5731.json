  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied on the initial condition vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), with M being a constant matrix. The interaction is studied under different transformations by incorporating another matrix function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying a supplementary transformation \\\\( j(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\) (where K is a constant matrix) at some time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) during the system's evolution, does the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) still solely depend on the dynamics of M and not the effects of D or K?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( j(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation. The final state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), now relies on the combined effects of M, D, and K. These transformations, especially if the matrices do not commute, contribute variously to the overall system behavior, influencing the trajectory and the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
