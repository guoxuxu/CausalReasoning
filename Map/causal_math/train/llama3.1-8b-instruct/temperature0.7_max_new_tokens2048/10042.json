  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact on a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), governed by a set of coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du\\\\), where A, B, C, D are matrices and u is a control function. We explore the system's behavior as influenced by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) impacts the initial conditions and trajectory in a manner dependent on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). Without knowing the transformation's application, the precise original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) cannot be accurately backed out from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the modification of initial conditions through the complex exponential phase shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
