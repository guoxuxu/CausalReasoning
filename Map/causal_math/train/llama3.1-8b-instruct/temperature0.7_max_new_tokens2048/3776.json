  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\), can we uniquely ascertain both the value of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and whether \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The temporal evolution of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) values and applications of \\\\( G(k) \\\\). Different scenarios could yield similar or indistinguishable transformed outcomes at time T due to the overlapping influence of damping and propagation characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
