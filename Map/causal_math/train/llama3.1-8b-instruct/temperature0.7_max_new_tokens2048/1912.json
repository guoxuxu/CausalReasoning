  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a Hermitian matrix and i is the imaginary unit, defining oscillatory dynamics. We explore the consequences of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely deduce the nature of earlier applied interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used to arrive at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is hindered by the indistinguishable effects of the non-commuting matrix exponentials B and C. Multiple interaction scenarios could lead to the same or very similar final states, making it challenging to identify specific applied transformations conclusively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
