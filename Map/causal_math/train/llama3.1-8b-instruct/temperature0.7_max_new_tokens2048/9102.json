  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(z(w)\\\\) for a particular \\\\(w\\\\), can we determine uniquely the scalar \\\\(a\\\\) used to scale \\\\(f(x)\\\\) in its modification without other information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\(z(w)\\\\) for a specific \\\\(w\\\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the scalar \\\\(a\\\\), as the integral does not preserve unique information about scalar multiplications applied to the input function \\\\(f(x)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
