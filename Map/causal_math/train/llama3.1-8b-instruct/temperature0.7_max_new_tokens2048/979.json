  "Problem": "Assuming a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. A Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it to a new domain.\n\nIf an intervention applies a second transformation \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = s_1 \\\\), would the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( T > s_1 \\\\) rely solely on the original differential equations parameters A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new transformation, effectively altering the nature of the subsequent inverse Laplace transform and hence the time domain behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), rendering it dependent not just on A and B, but also on the nature of G(s).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
