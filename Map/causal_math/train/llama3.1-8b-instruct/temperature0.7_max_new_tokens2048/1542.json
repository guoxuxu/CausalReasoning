  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nGiven the system state at some time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely infer if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially without observing the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state under \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) might coincide at specific times with the state obtained without transformation due to periodic properties. Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the initial conditions (with or without transformation) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
