  "Problem": "Assume we are examining two parameterized functions, \\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\) and \\( g(w) = e^{\\lambda w} \\), where \\( c \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are complex numbers. We explore the effects of transformations involving these functions on the complex plane over parameter \\( t \\).\n\nIf we observe \\( g(w(t)) = e^{\\lambda t(z^2 + cz)} \\) at some time \\( t \\), can we assert that \\( z \\) definitely adheres to the form \\( z^2 + cz \\) as initially posited without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\( g(w(t)) \\), tracing back to \\( w(t) = \\lambda t(z^2 + cz) \\) and hence \\( w = z^2 + cz \\) unmistakably adheres to the original formulation of \\( f(z) \\). The outcomes perfectly respect the initial function assumption since the transformation and its inverse are directly identifiable and unique under these operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
