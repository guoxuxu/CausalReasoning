  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanical system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian H. We study the effect of applying a linear operator \\\\( U = e^{-iHt} \\\\) on the state vector at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( U \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under the Schrödinger equation without any further intervention, will the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the Schrödinger equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U \\\\) at t = 0 effectively prepares the state vector in the same form as it would evolve naturally under the Schrödinger equation. Since \\\\( U \\\\) is essentially the time-evolution operator for the Hamiltonian H, the evolution is coherent and maintains the system in an equivalent state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
