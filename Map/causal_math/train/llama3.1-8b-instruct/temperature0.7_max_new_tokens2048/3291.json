  "Problem": "Analyze the interplay of linear transformations and differential operators in a vector space. Assume we have a set of equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. Then, explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\(g(z) = Rz\\\\), where R is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a moment \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new linear transformation \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\) (where S is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be determined only by D, disregarding R or S?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Sz\\\\) as an intervention changes the dynamics again, making the end state at time T dependent not only on D but also influenced by S and the earlier R. The transformations modify the trajectory and the final endpoint through their combined effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
