  "Problem": "Consider a function h(z) defined over the complex plane, and let's apply a Fourier transform on this function, denoted as H(w), to analyze its behavior in frequency space.\n\nGiven only the modified inverse Fourier transform result after applying exp(-aw^2), can we determine both the original polynomial degree n and the value of a?",
  "Explanation": "While certain traits of the resulting function may hint at the degree or the convolution with a Gaussian, precisely identifying both the original polynomial degree n and the specific parameter a without additional information about the interference is generally not feasible due to the overlap of effects produced by each operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
