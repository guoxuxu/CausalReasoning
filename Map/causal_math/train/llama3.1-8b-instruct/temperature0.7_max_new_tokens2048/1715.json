  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze whether certain transformations can infer causal relationships or predict the system's behavior accurately.\n\nIf an additional phase shift \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)), will the final state \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z'(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the initial phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), the intrinsic frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and the intervention phase shift \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). The effect of these phase shifts accumulates and alters the amplitude at any point T, demonstrating dependency beyond just the frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
