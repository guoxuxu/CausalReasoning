  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nBy observing the value of \\\\( f(z_1) \\\\) for some \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if only the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) was used without the transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While we can infer that \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) describes the transformation between \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_1 \\\\), without concrete bounds or additional data, multiple z values might satisfy \\\\( f(z_1) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
