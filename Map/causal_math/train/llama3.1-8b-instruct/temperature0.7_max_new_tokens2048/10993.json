  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where an electrical circuit is represented by a system of linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a matrix describing the dynamics of the circuit. The response of this circuit to external stimuli is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M is a matrix and N is a vector.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) initially modifies the state vector to \\\\( Mx_0 + N \\\\), which then evolves differently under the system dynamics compared to just \\\\( x_0 \\\\). This initial state alteration affects the trajectory, pushing the system into a different state space trajectory by the time t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
