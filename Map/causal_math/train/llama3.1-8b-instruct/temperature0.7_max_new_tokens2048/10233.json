  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time. We explore how different transformations influence this function, specifically transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different times.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and allow the system to evolve naturally, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if it were evolved without applying \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( T_1(e^{it}) = e^{e^{it}} \\\\) substantially modifies the growth and oscillatory behavior of the function, the path and final state at time T are altered compared to the natural evolution of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
