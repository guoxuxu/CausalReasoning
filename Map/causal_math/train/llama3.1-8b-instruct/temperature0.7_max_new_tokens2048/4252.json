  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the system \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t)\\\\), with P being a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( g(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlapping effects and non-commutative nature of the matrix transformations, identifying the exact sequence or type of interventions from the endpoint alone is ambiguous. Different transformation sequences can yield the same endpoint, complicating the inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
