  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the integral equation \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} K(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( K(t) \\) is a time-dependent control function applied to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\( f(y) = Cy + D \\) where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constant matrices, at time \\( t_0 \\).\n\nConsidering the final state \\( y(T) \\), can we precisely identify which transformations were used (whether \\( f(y) \\), \\( g(y) \\), or both), and in which sequence, solely based on the outcome at \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\( y(T) \\) could result from various permutations and combinations of the transformations \\( f(y) \\) and \\( g(y) \\), due to their additive and multiplicative effects. Identifying the specific transformations and sequence applied requires additional information beyond the observed final state, due to the overlapping potential influences and non-unique resultant states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
