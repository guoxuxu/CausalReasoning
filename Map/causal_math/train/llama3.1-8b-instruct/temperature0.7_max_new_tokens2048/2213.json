  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\) is computed for \\( 0 \\leq t \\leq T \\) without further transformation, will \\( z(T) \\) equal the direct application of \\( z(T) = e^{AT}v \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\) exactly represents the state at any time \\( t \\), with \\( e^{At} \\) being the fundamental solution to the matrix exponential growing linearly with \\( A \\). Therefore, \\( z(T) \\) directly yields \\( e^{AT}v \\) without alteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
