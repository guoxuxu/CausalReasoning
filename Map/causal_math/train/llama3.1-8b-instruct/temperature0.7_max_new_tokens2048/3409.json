  "Problem": "Analyze the causal inference of a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = U(t)z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a unitary operator in the complex plane and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system is disturbed by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{A\\tau}z \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant real-valued matrix and \\\\( \\tau \\\\) is time of application.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the beginning and then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = U(t)z_0 \\\\) without further disruptions, will the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), be the same as if no initial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z' = e^{A\\tau}z_0 \\\\). Thus, the future states evolve from \\\\( z' \\\\), not \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the trajectory changes according to the magnitude and direction set by A in addition to the rotation by \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). This leads to a different endpoint at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
