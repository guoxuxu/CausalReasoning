  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by a vector function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( v(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\\\), and subsequently manipulating the system using a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( v(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\\\) is computed at time t = 0, and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( v(k, t) \\\\) at t = T directly reflect the unmanipulated causal dynamics of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the system's state provides an alternate representation (in the frequency domain) but does not alter the physical dynamics imposed by the operator \\\\( L \\\\). Thus, the temporal evolution of \\\\( v(k, t) \\\\) reflects the dynamics of \\\\( L \\\\) without modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
