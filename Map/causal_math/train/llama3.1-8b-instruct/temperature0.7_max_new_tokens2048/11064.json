  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We study the effect of a linear transformation of variables defined by the matrix \\\\( T = \\\\begin{pmatrix} P & Q \\\\\\\\ R & S \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), applied initially at time t = 0.\n\nWith the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) known, can we distinguish whether the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the intervention \\\\( U \\\\), or both were applied, by solely analyzing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both transformations were applied from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is highly challenging due to the superposition and potential cancellation effects between the transformations. The end state could feasibly be achieved through various combinations of transformations and initial conditions, leading to ambiguity in causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
