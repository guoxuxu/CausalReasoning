  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by a linear differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effects of introducing a modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) = V(t) + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf an additional intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), such as changing the resistance to \\\\( R' \\\\) or adding a different sinusoidal component, will the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( V'(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The changes in voltage source and resistance as interventions cause multiple influences on the final current \\\\( I(T) \\\\). The state at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depends on the initial conditions set by either \\\\( V(t) \\\\) or \\\\( V'(t) \\\\), as well as any later modifications, rendering the current state influenced by multiple factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
