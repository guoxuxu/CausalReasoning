  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) further modifies the trajectory by an exponential factor dependent on time and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The eventual state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) depends not only on the rotational frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also intricately on both the scaling introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Each transformation compoundedly affects the final amplitude and phase of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
