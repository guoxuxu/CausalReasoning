  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) under transformation by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) described by the integral transform \\\\(L(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt\\\\) over some interval. Assess how the behavior and interpretation of z changes when subjected directly or through transformation L.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) after observing its transform \\\\(L(z)\\\\) without knowing \\\\(L\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\(L\\\\), the original function characteristics such as its amplitude, phase or frequency cannot be accurately deduced due to the integral operation modifying these properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
