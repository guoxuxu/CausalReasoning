  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where C is a real constant representing frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\) is studied over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nGiven the final complex function state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely infer the transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) that were applied during the evolution period only based on the resultant function value at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can match the outcomes from different interventions or non-interventions due to overlapping effects in the integral transformations of complex exponential functions. This means multiple sequences of transformations can lead to the same final state, making it challenging to determine them uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
