  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) evolving over time governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent real and imaginary components respectively. A Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ z(t) \\} = Z(s) \\) is applied to examine the system in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) of a function \\( z(t) \\), can we accurately infer the original functions \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional boundary or initial conditions, the inverse Laplace transform does not uniquely determine the original functions \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), particularly when considering the requirements of the Cauchy-Riemann equations in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
