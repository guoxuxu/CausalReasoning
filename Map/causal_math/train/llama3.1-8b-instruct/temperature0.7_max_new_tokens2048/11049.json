  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( p(x) \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to form a new function \\\\( q(x) = p(x)h(x) \\\\), and then its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is taken, will the transformed result directly correspond to the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) multiplied by the Fourier transform of \\\\( p(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem in Fourier analysis, the Fourier transform of the product of two functions, in this case \\\\( q(x) = p(x)h(x) \\\\), equals the convolution of their individual Fourier transforms. Given that \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a Gaussian function, its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, hence \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) results from convoluting \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) with a Gaussian, not just a simple multiplication.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
