  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform on a function representing vector components \\\\( v(t) \\), where \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( v(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the nature of the interventions used (whether Fourier transform, Laplace transform, or both) at earlier times by observing the state at \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both Fourier and Laplace transforms affect the frequency and time domain properties differently, the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations or sequences of these transforms. Without additional information, it's impossible to uniquely backtrack the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
