  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of the convolution operation using a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with its transform \\\\( K(s) \\\\), on the system function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output at t = T, can we determine uniquely whether the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was convolved with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) initially without other information?",
  "Explanation": "The output at t = T after convolution with a kernel can be similar to various other combinations of functions and convolutions, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to the specifics of initial conditions without additional information about the kernel or initial function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
