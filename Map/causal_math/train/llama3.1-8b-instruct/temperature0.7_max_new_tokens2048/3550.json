  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the behavior of a scalar field \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation. The equation is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. An integral transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} u(x, t) dx \\\\) is applied to study the system's evolution.\n\nCan the original scalar field \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be uniquely deduced from observing \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) without knowing the intermediate states of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the properties of the Laplace transform allow for some reverse engineering, the incomplete information about how the diffusion process impacts the transform through intermediate states means that other potential initial conditions could result in the same observed transformation at time T due to the non-uniqueness property of solutions impacted by partial differential operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
