  "Problem": "Assume a complex signal processing system that employs a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), to convert time domain signals, \\\\( s(t) \\\\), into frequency domain representations. We analyze the causal effects of applying an inverse Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(F) \\\\), and modifications to the signal post transform.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and allowed to propagate through the system without any modifications, will the subsequent application of an inverse Laplace transform lead to reproduction of the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While both transformations are integral in frequency and complex plane analysis, their direct application without considering signal adjustments or filter effects introduces disparities. The inverse Laplace transform of a Fourier-transformed signal doesn't necessarily yield the original time-domain signal due to differences in the treatment of complex frequencies and convergence behaviors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
