  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t)\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We also introduce a transformation \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Kt}Sx \\\\) where S is the matrix that diagonalizes D, and K is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) just by analyzing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can be achieved through different initial conditions or transformations due to the possible overlap in effects induced by different matrices K and M. Additionally, the interplay between S, K, and D adds to the complexity, making it difficult to deduce the history of interventions solely based on the endpoint data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
