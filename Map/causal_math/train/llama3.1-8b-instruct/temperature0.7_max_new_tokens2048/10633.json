  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the original function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transformation into the complex s-plane. We study the effects of a convolution operation with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented by its transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is convoluted with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to produce \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\), then transformed without further modification, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as the product of the initial transforms, i.e., \\\\( F(s)G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual transforms. Therefore, the transform of \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) will be \\\\( F(s)G(s) \\\\), consistent over time if there are no further modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
