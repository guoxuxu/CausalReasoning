  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+P}\\\\), where P is a constant. We explore the consequences of an operation defined by \\\\(v(t) = t^2 * u(t)\\\\) and its inverse Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the final transform result \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\(t^2 * u(t)\\\\), \\\\(e^{Qt} * u(t)\\\\), or both), solely from the value of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) might be the result of multiple possible sequences or combinations of the transformations owing to the complex interplay between the algebraic operations and the transforms. Hence, it is challenging to precisely identify the nature of interventions used, resulting from their mathematical properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
