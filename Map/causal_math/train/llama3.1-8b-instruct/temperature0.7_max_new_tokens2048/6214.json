  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we examine the flow of an incompressible fluid using the Navier-Stokes equations in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The equations are given by \\\\(\\\\rho (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\mathbf{u}) = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\mu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the fluid density, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of manipulating the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as an external intervention.\n\nCan we infer the initial viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) by observing the behavior of the velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(t)\\\\) at time t without knowing other initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(t)\\\\) is influenced by multiple factors including initial velocity distribution, fluid density, and external forces. Not knowing these conditions limits the ability to uniquely determine the viscosity simply by observing the velocity field.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
