  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nHaving observed the transformed \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after applying an unknown damping factor, can we precisely identify both the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with complete knowledge of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), recovering both the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and the exact form of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be highly non-trivial. Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and perturbations in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could lead to the same or very similar \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), especially given the complexity introduced by damping in the time-to-frequency domain transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
