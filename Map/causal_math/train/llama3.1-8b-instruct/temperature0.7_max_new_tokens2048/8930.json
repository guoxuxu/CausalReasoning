  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) over time t, where P is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we accurately retrieve the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of knowledge regarding the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is not possible to accurately determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\) could have altered the initial state in a way that is not directly invertible, especially if P and Q are non-commutative.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
