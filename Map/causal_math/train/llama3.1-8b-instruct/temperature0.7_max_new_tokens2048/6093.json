  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) under an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] \\\\) without further modification, will the transformed function only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without being influenced by the initial choice of \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] \\\\) directly depends on both the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the decay component \\\\( s \\\\). The choice of \\\\( s \\\\) significantly affects the outcome of the integral, and thereby the final transformed function is influenced by both parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
