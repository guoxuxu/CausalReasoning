  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex vector and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a Laplace transform, defined symbolically as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this system over the complex frequency variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nCan the exact nature (matrix and time) of the intervention be deduced by examining \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific details of an intervention, such as the change from \\\\( C \\\\) to \\\\( D \\\\) and the exact time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) it occurred, requires more than just the Laplace transform output. The transformation masks the direct effects by blending the influences of both periods (before and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\)), creating a compound result that cannot distinctly reveal precise intervention details.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
