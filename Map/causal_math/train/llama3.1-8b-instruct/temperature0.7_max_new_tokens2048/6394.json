  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), involving a complex matrix F, is applied at different instances.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), any inference about \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could be inaccurate as the transformation \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) which could have been applied may involve complex rotation and scaling, leading to multiple potential initial states that could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
