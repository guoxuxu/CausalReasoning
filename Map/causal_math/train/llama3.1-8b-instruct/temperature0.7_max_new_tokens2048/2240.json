  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( R(z) \\\\), another transformation, or none) during the interval from 0 to T, based only on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The mixing of effects introduced by the integral and potential additional transformations, such as adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) or others not defined, creates a multitude of pathways leading to the same or similar outcomes. This superposition makes it impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer the exact interventions or their sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
