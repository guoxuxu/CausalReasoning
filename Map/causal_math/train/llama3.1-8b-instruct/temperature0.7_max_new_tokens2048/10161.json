  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y + p(t)x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x + p(t)y \\\\), and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a known function of time t.\n\nIf the differential operator \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially, without any further manipulation, will the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to the direct evaluation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T under the standard coupled differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the specified differential equations, the operator \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) will correctly predict the system's evolution to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under these conditions, as the evolution is inherently encoded in the differential equations which describe \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
