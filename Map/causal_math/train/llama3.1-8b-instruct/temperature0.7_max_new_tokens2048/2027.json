  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by a set of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')\\\\, dt'\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(S(z) = e^{Dt}z\\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant complex function at \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, but not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new intervention \\\\(S(z)\\\\) adds another layer of complexity as it involves an additional exponential transformation of the state space. This results in the final observed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) being influenced not only by A and B, but also significantly by D and possibly the effects of C, depending on their commutative properties and the interaction of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
