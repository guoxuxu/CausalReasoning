  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the real and imaginary parts of the complex plane. We are analyzing the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sz} ds \\\\).\n\nIf another function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} \\\\sin(sz) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time t = T/2, will the endpoint at t = T depend solely on the direct application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) regardless of the previous application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another aspect to the function's trajectory, which influences the final state along with any prior transformations (i.e., \\\\( g(z) \\\\)). Therefore, the endpoint at t = T is a result of the effects of both previous transformations and the new intervention, not solely the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → f(z); f(z) → g(z); g(z) → h(z); t → g(z); h(z) → endpoint at t = T; g(z) → endpoint at t = T; f(z) → endpoint at t = T"
