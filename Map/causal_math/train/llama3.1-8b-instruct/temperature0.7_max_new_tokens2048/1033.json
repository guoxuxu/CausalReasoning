  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex scalar function z(t) governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\), where A and B are complex constants, and w is a real constant. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{Ct}z + D\\\\), where C and D are complex constants, at different points in time.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T evolve identically as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\) without applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) alters the initial condition to \\\\(z_0' = e^{C0}z_0 + D = z_0 + D\\\\) due to the implementation of the transformation at t = 0. This modified starting point impacts both the magnitude and trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time, differing from the trajectory had no transformation been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
