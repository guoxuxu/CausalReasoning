  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system governed by \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of a holomorphic transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is considered over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\sqrt{z} \\\\) (an analytic branch of the square root function) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affects the state trajectory by altering the magnitude and phase. Both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) contribute to deviations from the standard evolution determined by \\\\( \\omega \\\\), influencing the resultant state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
