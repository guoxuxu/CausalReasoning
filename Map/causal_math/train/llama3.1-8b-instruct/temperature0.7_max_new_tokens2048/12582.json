  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( A \\) is a real matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\( T(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), applied to \\( z(t) \\) at different time points \\( t \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nAssuming an intervention happens at \\( t_1 \\) where the function \\( z(t) \\) is multiplied by another function \\( g(t) = e^{-Bt} \\) for \\( B \\) being another real matrix, will the endpoint \\( T(z(t)) \\) solely depend on the original matrix \\( A \\) independently of \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying with \\( g(t) \\) before applying \\( T \\) modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( e^{iAt-Bt} \\), and thus \\( T(z(t)) \\) will now incorporate effects from both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The Laplace transformation will yield results depending on the linear combination of these matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
