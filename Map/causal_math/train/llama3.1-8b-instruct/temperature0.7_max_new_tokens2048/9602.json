  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a partial differential equation shown by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analyze the scenario where a transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is performed, with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) representing the Fourier transform.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain whether the observed \\\\( u(T) \\\\) resulted directly from evolution under L or from modified conditions due to the Fourier transformation. Different initial conditions can yield the same result under different operational conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
