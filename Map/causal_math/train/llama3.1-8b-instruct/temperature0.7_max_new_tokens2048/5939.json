  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is an input vector. The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) also being constant matrices.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by a function \\\\( f(z) = E^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\) are constant matrices) is applied, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( D, C, E, \\\\) or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces another layer of transformation that affects the system's trajectory. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on all involved matrices (\\\\( A, D, C, E, \\\\) and \\\\( F \\\\)). These transformations can interact in complex ways, each significantly impacting the system's behavior and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
