  "Problem": "Analyze the vector field transformation under a nonlinear map \\\\(G(z) = z^2 + c\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) are complex numbers, and the implementation of the Laplace transform on the time trajectories of a function \\\\( h(t) = Re(G(e^{i\\\\omega t})) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely identify the original parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after observing the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), assuming no knowledge of the intermediate state of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) solely based on the Laplace transform result at time \\\\( T \\\\) is indeterminate without additional constraints or data about the trajectory of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), due to potential equivalences in the transform outcomes from various parameter sets.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "c → G; ω → h; G → h; z → G; e^(iωt) → h; T → h; h → Laplace transform of h"
