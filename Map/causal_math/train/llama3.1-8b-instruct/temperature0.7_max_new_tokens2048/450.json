  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) where \\\\( z_1, z_2 \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of different contour deformations in the complex plane when computing the contour integral of \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of the integral of \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) along some contour, can we determine the specific shape of the original contour used?",
  "Explanation": "The integral value, particularly if it does not enclose different poles during deformation, does not uniquely identify the shape of the contour. Multiple contours adhering to the conditions of Cauchy's theorem can result in the same integral value; thus, knowing only the integral value does not provide information about the specific initial contour shape.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Contour shape → Contour integral value; Contour integral value → Contour deformation; Contour deformation → z1; Contour deformation → z2; z1 → F(z1, z2); z2 → F(z1, z2); F(z1, z2) → Contour integral value",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Contour shape influences Contour integral value, which in turn influences Contour deformation, which affects z1 and z2. The values of z1 and z2 determine the function F(z1, z2), and F(z1, z2) is directly related to the Contour integral value."
