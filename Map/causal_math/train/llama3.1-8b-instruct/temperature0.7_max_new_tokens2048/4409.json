  "Problem": "Examine the effect of performing a Laplace transform on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). Suppose an inverse Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to yield \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We then analyze whether the transformations preserve certain properties of the original function over time.\n\nIf no intervention is made after performing the Laplace transform and its inversion, will the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) be identical to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at all times?",
  "Explanation": "Under the assumption that all conditions for the Laplace transform and its inversion are met (including issues of convergence and the function being well-defined in the complex plane), the operations are theoretically reversible, resulting in \\\\( g(t) \\\\) being identical to \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
