  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the original time-dependent function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transform in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of applying the inverse transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(G)(t) \\\\), after manipulating \\\\( G(s) = F(s)R(s) \\\\), where \\\\( R(s) \\\\) is a modification function.\n\nGiven \\\\( g(t) \\\\) for some function \\\\( R(s) \\\\) used in modifying \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we precisely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( R(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( R(s) \\\\), it's impossible to revert \\\\( G(s) \\\\) reliably to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) since multiple forms of \\\\( R(s) \\\\) could produce the same modified function. The lack of information about \\\\( R(s) \\\\) limits the ability to accurately deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
