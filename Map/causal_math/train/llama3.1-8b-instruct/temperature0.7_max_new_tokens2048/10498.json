  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) governed by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{iBt} \\\\), where B is another real number, applied at time t.\n\nCan we deduce the initial complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the added term \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) at the starting condition might be non-traceable, especially if the phases induced by A and B differ significantly. This renders it impossible to conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from just \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
