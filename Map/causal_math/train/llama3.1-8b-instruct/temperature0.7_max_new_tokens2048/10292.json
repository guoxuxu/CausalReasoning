  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\) which is a complex exponential representing oscillatory behavior with a constant \\\\( C \\\\) and angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\). An operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as follows: \\\\( Tz(t) = z(t + h) \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a time-shift constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved through various combinations of time shifts and natural evolution, especially since time shifts in opposite directions could cancel each other out or modify each other's effects. Without additional information on the sequence and nature of the interventions, it is impossible to determine precisely which were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
