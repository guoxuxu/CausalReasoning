  "Problem": "Contemplate a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves as per the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the scenario under a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is another constant frequency.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces a phase shift that continuously evolves over time, complicating direct backward calculations to retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without specific knowledge of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and its application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
