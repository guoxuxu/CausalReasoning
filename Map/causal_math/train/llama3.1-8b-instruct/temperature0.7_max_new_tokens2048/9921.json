  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) defined in a one-dimensional space. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform applied to u(x,0) to analyze the wave's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) of the initial wave function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) is calculated and then the system evolves according to the wave equation, will the wave's spatial characteristics at any time t be directly predictable from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) without any further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform characterizes the frequency components of the wave at t = 0, which determine the wave's evolution in time. The wave equation solution uses these initial spectral components to predict the state at any future time, considering the linear and time-invariant properties of the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
