  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. The analysis focuses on the consequences of integral transformations such as the Laplace transform on the time behavior of this system.\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then inverse transformed without further modifications, will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be recovered exactly as \\\\( w(T) \\\\) as if the transformations had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The process of taking a Laplace transform followed by its inverse transform essentially allows for the function to be recovered perfectly assuming all conditions for the transforms are met and they are properly applied. This restores the function to its original form, unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform application → change in z; change in z → change in w(z); change in w(z) → change in w(t); inverse Laplace transform → change in w(t); w(t) at t=T → w(T); w(T) → w(t) at t=T"
