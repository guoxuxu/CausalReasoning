  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), resulting in the partial differential equation \\\\( Lu = 0 \\\\). We investigate the system's response to a mapping defined by \\\\( v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)] \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) represents a Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T[u(x,t)] \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) evolves under the same operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be equivalent to the situation where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was evolved directly to \\\\( T \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform as \\\\( T \\\\) changes the function's spectral components. Even under the same linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), the evolution of transformed and original functions can differ significantly due to changes in how different frequency components react to the operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
