  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Dx\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, and D. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\(T\\\\) described by the matrix \\\\(\\\\begin{pmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), or both), knowing only the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) can result from multiple potential sequences or types of interventions due to the complex interplay of matrix transformations and the dynamics introduced by the differential equations. Since multiple transformation pathways could lead to the same endpoint under these conditions, it is impossible to uniquely backtrack the exact series or nature of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
