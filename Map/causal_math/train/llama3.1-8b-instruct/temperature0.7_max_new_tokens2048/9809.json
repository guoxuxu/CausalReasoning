  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation under a Fourier transformation, denoted as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k^2 \\\\hat{u} + \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) is a transformed external force. The parameter k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\\\hat{u}_0(k) \\\\) is provided, and no further force is applied (\\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) = 0 \\\\) for all t>0), will the solution \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\) at a later time t depend only on the initial condition \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the wave equation without external forces relies solely on the initial state and the inherent properties of the equation itself. In this case, the solution evolves as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\hat{u}_0(k) e^{-k^2 t} \\\\), showing dependency only on the initial condition and not on any external influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
