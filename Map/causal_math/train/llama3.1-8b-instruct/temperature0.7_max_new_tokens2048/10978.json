  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was initially applied, can we reliably deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), and given the linear transformation potentially alters the starting state, deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes ambiguous as both the transformation and the differential evolution alter the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
