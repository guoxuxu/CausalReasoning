  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( u(z) \\\\) represents a potential field. We're exploring the effect of a linear transformation on this field, specifically through the function \\\\( T(w) = (Aw + b) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( w \\\\) is the transformed variable.\n\nIf applying an additional transformation \\\\( S(w) = (Cw + d) \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants) at time \\\\( t \\\\), does the final potential \\\\( u(w) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) depend solely on the initial application of \\\\( T \\\\) and not on \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The further transformation \\\\( S(w) \\\\) introduces additional modification to the input of \\\\( u \\\\), and thus the final evaluation of \\\\( u(w) \\\\) for any such \\\\( w \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\). The parameters \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) will affect the input just as significantly as \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) did originally, altering the potential field in a new manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "u(z) → u(w); T(w) → w; w → T(w); T(w) → S(w); S(w) → u(w); A → T(w); C → S(w); b → T(w); d → S(w)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final potential u(w) at time T depends solely on the initial application of T and not on S because the presence of A, b, C, and d does not affect the outcome directly; however, A and C influence T and S respectively, while b and d are added to the transformed w."
