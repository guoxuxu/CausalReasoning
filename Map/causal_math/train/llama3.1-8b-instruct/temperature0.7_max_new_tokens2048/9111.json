  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which ensures that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analytic. Further, suppose a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, producing \\\\( L[z(t)] = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention changes \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by adding a complex harmonic function \\\\( h(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T > t_1 be merely dependent on the original function parameters and not on \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a complex harmonic function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new frequency components to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Consequently, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for T > t_1 would depend on both the behavior of the original function and the characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), especially frequency \\\\( w \\\\) and its interaction with existing components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
