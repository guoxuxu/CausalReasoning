  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system controlled by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Lz(t) + K \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\), where L and K are constant matrices. We examine the influence of the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to accurately determine which interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be achievable via various combinations of interventions due to the complexities introduced by the exponential matrix operators. The unique effects of D and C combined with the feedback system's dynamics can create a scenario where multiple different intervention pathways result in the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
