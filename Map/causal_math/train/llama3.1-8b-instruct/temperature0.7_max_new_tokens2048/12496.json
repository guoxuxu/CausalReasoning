  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane. The function is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\), implying a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is computed without any further intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = h(z_0) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = iz \\\\) results in a rotation of the complex argument, which typically changes the path of integration \\\\( \\\\Gamma \\\\) due to the dependency of \\\\( g \\\\) on the complex exponential term \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\). This rotation affects the outcome of the integral, hence altering the result of \\\\( g \\\\) from its original calculation at \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
