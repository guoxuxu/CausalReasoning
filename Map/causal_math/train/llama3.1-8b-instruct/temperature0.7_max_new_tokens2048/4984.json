  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the linear transformation \\\\( T: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) and let \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. A transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is known to be applied, where B is also a constant matrix. The behavior of the system under this transformation over time t is studied.\n\nGiven the end-state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the end-state value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-commutative nature of the exponential matrix functions and potential overlapping effects of multiple interventions, it is infeasible to uniquely track back and ascertain which specific transformations were employed. Multiple valid combinations of interventions could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
