  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function is subjected to a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if transformations on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or \\\\( y(t) \\\\) were not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Allowing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without intervention changes the forms of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\), impacting the result of the Fourier Transform at any frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), due to the differential impact of A and B on their respective functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
