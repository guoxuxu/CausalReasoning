  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined on the real axis, \\\\( u(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is transformed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\), can one clearly determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) if \\\\( s \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the value of \\\\( s \\\\), the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined due to the inseparable dependence of the transformed result on both \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). There are infinite possible values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) corresponding to different values of \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
