  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the behavior under complex transformations such as \\( f(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), with \\( \\theta \\) being another real constant.\n\nFrom the observed state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine the initial state \\( z_0 \\) without knowing if \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the phase shift \\( \\theta \\) was introduced, it is impossible to tell if \\( z(T) \\) originated from \\( z_0 \\) or \\( e^{i\\theta}z_0 \\). The phase \\( \\theta \\) effectively obscures the original starting state given the similarities in the evolution pattern.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
