  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\(h_3(T)\\\\), can we definitively determine the sequence and nature of transformations (A, B, and C)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the previous cases without additional intervention, the exponential transformations result in a final form that is effectively the exponentiation of a summed constant. It is thus impossible to uniquely identify or distinguish the sequence or values of A, B, and C just from the final transformation due to their cumulative effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
