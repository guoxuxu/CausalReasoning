  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function in a variable \\\\( t \\\\). The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant. We test the effects of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( C \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( E \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional factor that influences the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the interplay of \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( E \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). The multiple transformations can interact in complex ways, affecting the trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
