  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nObserving \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original variable \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) was applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(X) \\\\) was applied, it could lead to large discrepancies between the potential values of \\\\( X_0 \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) could square to the same number, creating ambiguity. Therefore, without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(X) \\\\), \\\\( X_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the observed \\\\( X(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
