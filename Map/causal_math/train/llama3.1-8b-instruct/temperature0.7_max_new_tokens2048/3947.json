  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( f(z) = z^3 \\) is applied as an intervention, and \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is observed, will \\( z(T) \\) depend solely on the natural evolution and not on the transformations (\\( g(z) \\) or \\( f(z) \\))?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( f(z) = z^3 \\) modifies the trajectory such that \\( z(T) \\) cannot solely be determined by the natural evolution law \\( e^{it} \\). The effects of the powers and initial conditions significantly dictate the outcome, making \\( z(T) \\) dependent on both the natural evolution and applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
