  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real scalar and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex number value. We apply continuous linear transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex number, to this function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(g(z) = dz\\\\) (where \\\\(d\\\\) is another complex number) is applied, will the final state of the system at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will depend on both transformations. The transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) and \\\\(g(z) = dz\\\\) alter the trajectory of the state at different times, resulting in a final state that is a product of both transformations and the natural evolution, indicated by \\\\(dc e^{iAT}z_0\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
