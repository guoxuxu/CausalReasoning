  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the function to \\\\( f(u) = e^{-au^2+b} \\\\cos(tu) \\\\) halfway through computation, will the final result still only depend on the original variable adjustments made by \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the functional form and, subsequently, the outcome of the integral. Although \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) still influence the result through the initial variable change, the new function adds another level of complexity that affects the final integral result, thus not solely depending on the original constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
