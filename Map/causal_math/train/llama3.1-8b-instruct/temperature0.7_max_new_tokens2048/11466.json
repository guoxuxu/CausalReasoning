  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We analyze the behavior of the function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, is it possible to precisely deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the influence of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is not known?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, and considering that both \\\\( e^{AT} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT} \\\\) transformations were potentially involved, it's not feasible to uniquely pin down \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since both transformations considerably affect the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
