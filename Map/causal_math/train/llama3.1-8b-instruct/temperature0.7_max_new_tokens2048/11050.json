  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) of the product \\\\( q(x) = p(x)h(x) \\\\) is known, can we determine \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing what \\\\( p(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge about \\\\( p(x) \\\\), especially its parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the Gaussian function, it's impossible to accurately deconvolve \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(q)(\\\\omega) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). The result literally depends on the extent and nature of modification by \\\\( p(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
