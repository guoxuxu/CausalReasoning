  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the observed transformed function \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) after time T, can we clearly determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(f) \\\\), it is impossible to discern from the observed \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) alone as the frequency spectrum's decay due to \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) alone could appear similar to the transformation effects at different parameters.",
