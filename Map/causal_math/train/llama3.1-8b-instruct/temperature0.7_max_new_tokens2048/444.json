  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) and then studying its behavior under this transformation.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform, the application of \\\\( M \\\\), or both) only from knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used solely from the endpoint in the transformed state is not feasible because the operations in the frequency domain can produce complex interactions that are not distinguishable just based on the endpoint. Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions could lead to the same final state, creating ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
