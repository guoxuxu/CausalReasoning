  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. We explore the effects of applying a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\( D[f(t)] = f'(t) \\\\), and the corresponding effect in the Laplace domain.\n\nGiven a Laplace transform result that includes an s-term and an initial condition, can it be definitively determined whether the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was first modified by adding a constant before differentiation occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Because the derivative of a constant is zero, its inclusion before the derivative operator does not alter the outcome of the transformed function, which will be unaffected by such an addition in the differentiation step. As such, we cannot determine if there was an addition of a constant without information about prior manipulations or the original function directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
