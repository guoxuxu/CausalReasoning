  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T_1 \\\\) is initially applied and later, at some arbitrary point, \\\\( T_2 \\\\) is also applied before applying \\\\( f \\\\), does the final result depend solely on the initial value and \\\\( n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying both transformations changes the initial conditions by a factor of \\\\( ab \\\\) before \\\\( f \\\\) is applied. The final output \\\\( f(T_2(T_1(z_0))) = (abz_0)^n \\\\) depends on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), not just \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( n \\\\), due to the compounding effects of the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
