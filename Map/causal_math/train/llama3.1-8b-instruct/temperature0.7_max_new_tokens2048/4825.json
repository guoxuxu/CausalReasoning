  "Problem": "We explore a physical system where a beam is subjected to various forces over time. The forces are represented as functions of time, \\( f(t) \\), acting at different points on the beam. Fourier transforms of these functions (\\( F(\\omega) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency) are used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. The structural integrity response of the beam, \\( R(\\omega) \\), depends on these inputs.\n\nIf a force function \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) is applied from \\( t = 0 \\), and the system is observed over time without any new force, will the system's frequency response \\( R(\\omega) \\) at \\( \\omega = \\omega_1 \\) remain consistent over time until observation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) leads to a spectrum \\( F(\\omega) \\) that affects the beam's response. \\( R(\\omega) \\) can shift dynamically as the material properties and structural responses change over time under continuous force, which means the response at \\( \\omega_1 \\) can vary as the influence of the force evolves.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
