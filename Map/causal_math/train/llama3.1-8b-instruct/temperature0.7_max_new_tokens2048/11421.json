  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its impact on an integral transform described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore how the Laplace Transform of this function changes under different scenarios.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is increased, without any other intervention, will this change the convergence of the Laplace Transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affects the oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\). The Laplace Transform's convergence is sensitive to changes in the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) because it affects the behavior of the exponential decay required for convergence, particularly as \\\\( \\\\Re(s) \\\\) needs to be greater than zero for convergence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
