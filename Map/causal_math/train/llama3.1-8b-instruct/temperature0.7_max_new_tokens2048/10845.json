  "Problem": "Consider the flow behavior of a fluid characterized by the complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), where \\\\( w(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\) represents a complex potential in the z-plane. Analyze the effect of a conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is a complex function and evaluate its implications on the fluid flow.\n\nIf the conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\) is applied to the initial fluid flow pattern defined by \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the usual fluid dynamics equations without further intervention, will the flow pattern at t = T be the same as if the fluid flow had been directly evolved from \\\\( w(z) \\\\) to t = T without the map?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the conformal map alters the geometry of the domain which impacts the behavior of the fluid flow. Since the fluid dynamics are sensitive to boundary conditions and domain shape, the transformation \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\) changes these conditions, thus affecting the consequent behavior of the fluid at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → w(z); w(z) → z; z → e^(f(w)); e^(f(w)) → fluid flow pattern; fluid flow pattern → t; fluid flow pattern → t"
