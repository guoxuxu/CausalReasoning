  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable and f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact applying a Laplace transform on this function and then examining its behavior under various conditions.\n\nGiven the resulting Laplace transform from an intervention where the function's formulation was switched midway, can we pinpoint whether the original function was continuously the same or changed without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the resulting function captures cumulative effects of all segments, but identifying specific changes or interventions directly from the transform result is generally indeterminate without knowing initial conditions or the exact time and nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
