  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\mathbf{x}(t) = M\\\\mathbf{x}(t)\\\\), where M is a constant 2x2 matrix. Explore the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the system, where the Laplace transform of a vector function is applied component-wise.\n\nSuppose an additional non-linear transformation \\\\(g(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\) is introduced at time t = T/2. Will the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\) solely depend on the original system matrix M?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a non-linear transformation \\\\(g(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\) at time T/2 alters the system's trajectory in a manner that cannot be solely determined by M. The non-linear nature of \\\\(g\\\\) could introduce new dynamics, making the final state \\\\(\\\\mathbf{x}(T)\\\\) dependent on both M and the form of \\\\(g\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
