  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time evolving according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) as real constants. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-st}z(\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where the parameters \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are adjusted to new constants \\\\( k' \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the new parameters and not on the original \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the integral's value post-intervention. Both the original and the new parameters \\\\( k, \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k', \\\\omega' \\\\) will influence the system's trajectory, hence affecting \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\). The function's history pre-intervention retains an impact due to the cumulative nature of the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
