  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation by the contour integral along a path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in the complex plane. The integral transformation is described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi - z} d\\\\xi \\\\), which depends on the path of integration \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\).\n\nIf a different function, say \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), is introduced and integrated around a new path \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) during the transformation, will the original value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) remain unaltered by the choice of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integration of a new function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) along a different path \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) affects the resultant transformation. Since both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the path \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) can introduce new terms or change the conditions under which residues are calculated, the nature and outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) are inherently altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
