  "Problem": "In a region within a complex plane, consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time. The region has a transformation applied by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which performs a Laplace transform on these functions.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(w(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) is introduced at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) and another transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\) which also performs a type of integral transform is applied, will the final state of \\\\(Z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\) and depend solely on \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new function and a subsequent transformation affects the final state. Both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\) will have a cumulative impact on the output, influenced by the nature of the transformations and their respective properties on the functions involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
