  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the implications of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we recover the exact initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by inversely transforming the Laplace transform of a solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) observed up to a time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, while injective, requires full knowledge of the function over all time to uniquely invert the transform. Observations up to a finite time \\\\( T \\\\) provide incomplete information, making exact recovery of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from such data fundamentally limited.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
