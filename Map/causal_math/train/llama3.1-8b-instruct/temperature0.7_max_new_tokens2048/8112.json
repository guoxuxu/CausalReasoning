  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nKnowing the final calculation of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for T > intermediate time following interventions by \\\\( g(z) \\\\\\), can we distinctly deduce the type of interventions (variable values of S and U) applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific values of S and U solely from the final value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is impractical because multiple combinations of these variables can potentially result in the same output. The non-linear and overlapping effects of the exponential functions render such a determination ambiguous and not unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
