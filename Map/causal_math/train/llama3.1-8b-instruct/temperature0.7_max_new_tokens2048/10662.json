  "Problem": "Assume the behavior of a complex system can be modeled by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state in complex space, and A and C are constant complex matrices. Manipulations on the system are achieved by applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Dze^{Bt}\\\\), where D and B are also constant complex matrices.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can one infer the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, it's ambiguous if the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) comes from \\\\(Ce^{AT}z_0\\\\) or \\\\(Ce^{AT}(Dz_0)\\\\). Disentangling the effect of D from the evolution due to A and C is non-trivial without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
