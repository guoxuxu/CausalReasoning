  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature dynamics in a reactor is controlled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a rate constant, \\\\(T_e\\\\) is the external temperature, \\\\(T\\\\) is the reactor temperature, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term due to a reaction. The transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) is considered at a time instant to study the impact on the reactor's thermal behavior.\n\nIf \\\\(f(T)\\\\) is applied to the reactor temperature \\\\(T_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature at time \\\\(T(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to what it would have been if \\\\(T_0\\\\) had not been squared initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(T) = T^2\\\\) changes the initial reactor temperature drastically by squaring it, leading to a different starting point for the dynamics described by the differential equation. This different initial condition will affect the entire trajectory of the temperature over time, resulting in a different temperature profile at any subsequent time \\\\(t = T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
