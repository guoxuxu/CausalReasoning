  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping in complex analysis, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant complex frequency. We look into the effects of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) applied at initial time t = 0.\n\nDoes the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T directly determine the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) without any further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) directly integrates the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the transform is uniquely determined by the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time from the initial formulation of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to any time T. Thus, the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly impacts the outcome of \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) without the need for any external interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
