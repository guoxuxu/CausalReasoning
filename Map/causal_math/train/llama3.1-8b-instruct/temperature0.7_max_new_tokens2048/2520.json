  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. The Laplace Transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We analyze how changes in the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) influence the transformed function over the complex plane.\n\nAfter observing the modified Laplace Transform of the intervened function \\\\( h(t) = t^k e^{-at} \\\\), can we determine precisely the original values of both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) just from the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The modified Laplace Transform for the function \\\\( t^k e^{-at} \\\\) results in a form \\\\( \\\\frac{k!}{(s + a)^{k+1}} \\\\), allowing for the unique extraction of both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\) from the transform’s exponent and coefficient. Given this mathematical relationship, both parameters can be precisely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
