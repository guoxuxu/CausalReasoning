  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where a function \\( z(t) = e^{it}u \\) for complex \\( u \\) is undergoing transformation with \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\), where C is a complex number. The impact of an operation defined as \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) wherein D is a distinct complex constant is considered.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new operation \\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\) (where E is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(z) \\) introduces another modifying factor, affecting the final state \\( z(T) \\) depending on all C, D, and E. These transformations affect how z evolves from \\( t_1 \\) onward and the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) through the compounded effects of the exponential functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
