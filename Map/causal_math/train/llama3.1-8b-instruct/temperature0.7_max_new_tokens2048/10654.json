  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We are evaluating whether the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) applied to this function affects its causal inference properties.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the value of the complex constant \\\\( a \\\\) without additional data on how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was defined or changed over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform captures the effect of the complex exponential growth or decay, but without additional constraints or information on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or temporal variations in \\\\( a \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely backtrack to the precise nature or value of \\\\( a \\\\) because different parameters might result in similar transforms depending on the chosen domain of s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
