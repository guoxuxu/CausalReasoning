  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the integral of \\\\( K(T, s) \\\\) over \\\\( s \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine how much of the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is due to the original function \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) and how much is due to the constant shift introduced by \\\\( c \\\\). There could be many combinations of \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) producing the same output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
