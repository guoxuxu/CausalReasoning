  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the direct computation of the integral from 0 to T of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct computation of \\\\( T(z)(T) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\omega t} dt \\\\) is the definition of applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). There are no alterations or additional interventions made to modify the trajectory or the calculation method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
