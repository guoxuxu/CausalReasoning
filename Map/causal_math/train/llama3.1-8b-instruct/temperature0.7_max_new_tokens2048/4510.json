  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a real variable z. We are analyzing the treatment effect of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(f)(z) = \\int_0^z f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nHaving observed the result of \\\\( T(f)(z) \\\\) at z = T, can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation obscures the specific form of the original function since different functions can yield the same integral result. Additional information about the nature of the function prior to integration is necessary to conclusively identify \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
