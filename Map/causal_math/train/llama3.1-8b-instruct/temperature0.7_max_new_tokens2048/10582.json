  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system which is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a linear operator. An external control is modeled by multipling the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) by a matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\), where M is a time-independent matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) and whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\(x_0\\\\) and the application of \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) solely from \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is not feasible without more information because multiple combinations of \\\\(x_0\\\\) and M could yield the same \\\\(x(T)\\\\), especially without knowing the specific properties of M and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
