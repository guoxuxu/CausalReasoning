  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T match the evolution of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) directly to time T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state by integrating it with the matrix exponential function \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\), which affects how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) progresses. Consequently, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under this transformation will diverge from the direct evolution pathway due to the influence of N.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
