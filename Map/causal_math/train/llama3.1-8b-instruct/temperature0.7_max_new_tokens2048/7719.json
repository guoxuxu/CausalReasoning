  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) evolves over time t, and study the effect of the Laplace transform, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this complex function.\n\nIf a modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed, will the resulting \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( t^2 + it \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\cdot m(t) = (t^2 + it)e^{at} \\\\) for times \\\\( t \\geq t_1 \\\\). The changed function alters the Laplace transform results, making the transformed output dependent on the specific values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as well as the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
