  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z \\\\) on the complex plane defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix. We investigate how the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also being a real matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by the interventions \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) relies on both transformations \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) due to their modifications to the trajectory of the vector \\\\( z \\\\). Moreover, since these transformations are matrix exponentials, they could potentially provide overlapping or reinforcing effects that are dependent on the specific values and interactions of \\\\( A, B, \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
