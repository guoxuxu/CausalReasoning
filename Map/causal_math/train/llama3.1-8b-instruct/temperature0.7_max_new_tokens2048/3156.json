  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the sequence of control inputs (whether \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\), or both) used, solely based on knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of control inputs and their timings due to the integral transformation's ability to blend the effects of state changes over time. This integration makes it difficult to isolate the exact sequence of inputs that led to \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
