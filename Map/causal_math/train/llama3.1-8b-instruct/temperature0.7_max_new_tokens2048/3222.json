  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the consequence of applying a forcing function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, on the system's response over time t.\n\nHaving observed the system's response \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively conclude the initial conditions or absence/presence of the forcing function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the presence of the forcing function or the original state of the system, multiple scenarios (different initial conditions with or without the forcing function) might lead to the same observed outcome at T, given the linear nature of the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
