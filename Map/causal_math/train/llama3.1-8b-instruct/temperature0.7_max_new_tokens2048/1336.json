  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex numbers, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are complex constants. The function’s evolution over time is analyzed considering linear transformations and their implications on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of intervention, can we accurately identify whether the constants changed to \\\\( A' \\\\) or \\\\( B' \\\\), or identify the initial constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapped effects of the transformations before and after the intervention time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), in addition to the non-trivial dynamics introduced by the complex exponentials, render it impossible to unambiguously dissect and identify constants solely based on the state at \\\\( T \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( A, B, A', \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) might yield the same final state due to the nature of the complex exponential growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
