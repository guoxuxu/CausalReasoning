  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system modeled using a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u\\\\), where L is a differential operator which includes non-linear terms. A Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx}f(x)dx\\\\) is applied to the initial condition to verify the impact on a function propagating through this system.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t)dt\\\\), is applied at a time t = T/2 during the evolution of the system, will the final observed state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) solely depend on L and not on the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediate application of the Laplace transform introduces another layer of transformation that interacts uniquely with the current state of the system under L. This would affect the final observed state at T, implying the outcome depends on both the Fourier and Laplace transforms, alongside L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
