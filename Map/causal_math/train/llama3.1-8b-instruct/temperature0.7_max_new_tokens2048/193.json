  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its derivative \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\) in a system over time, focusing on how transformations affect causal inference.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(t) = e^{-t}\\\\) is multiplied with \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t=0, and then the system is observed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it}\\\\), will the function form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t=T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was evolved without multiplying by \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\(z_0\\\\) by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) introduces a damping factor that modifies the amplitude of the complex function over time. This transformation changes the behavior of the exponential growth in the imaginary exponential function, leading to a distinct trajectory and a different \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
