  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on a complex domain \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) are the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Assume that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, indicating that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is holomorphic. We study the impact of an integral transformation represented by \\\\( \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(z) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a real or complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is subjected to the integral transformation without any external modifications, will the transformation's result be independent of whether the function was originally holomorphic?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves an integration over an exponential function multiplied by \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is holomorphic and satisfies Cauchy-Riemann equations, it maintains its properties under linear transformations such as integration. The result of the integral transformation reflects the analytical extendibility intrinsic to holomorphic functions, which is preserved irrespective of specific function characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
