  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( A \\) is a real matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\( T(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), applied to \\( z(t) \\) at different time points \\( t \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf we know the transformed function \\( T(z(t)) \\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) at a specific time \\( t = 0 \\) without additional information or reversal of transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the Laplace transform \\( T(z(t)) \\) to exactly determine \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) generally requires knowledge of all coefficients and poles in \\( s \\)-space, and in practice, exact inversion is complex and often ambiguous without further context or constraints.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
