  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented in matrix form as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a invertible matrix. We explore the effects of applying a matrix transformation \\\\(T = e^{Mt}\\\\) to the vector \\\\(b\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(t\\\\) is a time variable.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(b) = e^{Mt}b\\\\) is applied to vector \\\\(b\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and the system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) is then solved without any further intervention, will the solution vector \\\\(x\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(b\\\\) was not transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T(b)\\\\) modifies the vector \\\\(b\\\\) to \\\\(e^{Mt}b\\\\), which changes the right-hand side of the equation. Since \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) now becomes \\\\(Ax = e^{Mt}b\\\\), the solution \\\\(x\\\\) must be altered, assuming \\\\(M\\\\) is not a zero matrix and affects the vector \\\\(b\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The time variable t causes the matrix M, and M causes the matrix T. M causes the transformation T to be applied to vector b, which in turn causes the solution vector x, and the matrix A causes the solution vector x."
