  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable and f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact applying a Laplace transform on this function and then examining its behavior under various conditions.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an exponential decay \\\\( f(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) where 'b' is a positive real constant was suddenly altered to \\\\( f(t) = e^{-ct} \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\), with each part independently transformed by Laplace, will the combined system response be affected only by the final segment of the function?",
  "Explanation": "The system's response in the Laplace domain will be a combination of both segments. Each segment contributes uniquely to the overall Laplace transform, reflecting exponentials decay rates 'b' and 'c'.  The full response in the Laplace domain is influenced by both and cannot be attributed solely to the later intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
