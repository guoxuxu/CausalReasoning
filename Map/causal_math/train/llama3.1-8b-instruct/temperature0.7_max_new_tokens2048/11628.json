  "Problem": "Assess the study of causal inference in a system modeled by a linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\(T_k(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) is applied, where k represents a frequency parameter.\n\nCan we determine exactly whether there was an intervention and what the operator \\\\(M\\\\) was, solely by examining the transformed output \\\\(T_k(u(T))\\\\) at some later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different interventions (different M's) could yield the same transformed output \\\\(T_k(u(T))\\\\), especially if these operators have similar effects on the propagated state or aspects of their influence are non-distinguishing in the transform space. The ambiguity in how transformations and interventions interplay does not allow for unique back-calculation of M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
