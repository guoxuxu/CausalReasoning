  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nGiven \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(S(z(x))) \\, dx \\), can we decipher the specific transformations used (whether \\( T \\), \\( S \\), or both) just by knowing the integration result and not the function or contour?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral does not retain specific clues about the distinct roles of \\( T \\) and \\( S \\). Due to their individual impact on the geometric and algebraic properties of \\( z \\), determining the exact transformations used only from the integral result is ambiguous, as multiple combination scenarios could yield the same outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
