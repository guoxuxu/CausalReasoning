  "Problem": "Consider the system x'' + p(t) x' + q(t) x = 0, where p(t) and q(t) are time-dependent coefficients. We're examining the effect of a Laplace transform on the mentioned differential equation, particularly focusing on the transformation sX(s) - x(0) - x'(0), where X(s) is the Laplace transform of x(t).\n\nCan we retrieve the original differential equation by observing the outcome of the Laplace transform (the s-domain equation) without additional data on initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform requires knowledge of the boundary conditions (here, x(0) and x'(0)) to fully reconstruct the original time-domain differential equation. Without these, the specific dynamics governed by the original differential equation cannot be accurately determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
