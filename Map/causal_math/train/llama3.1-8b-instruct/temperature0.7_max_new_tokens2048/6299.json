  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics of a particle moving in a potential field given by \\( V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. The motion is subject to an external force \\( F(t) \\), and the differential equation governing the motion is \\( m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx} + F(t) \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\( t_1 \\) in the form of a sudden change in the spring constant from \\( k \\) to \\( k' \\), will the subsequent position \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( F(t) \\) and not on the change in \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the spring constant from \\( k \\) to \\( k'\\) alters the potential field, thereby affecting the dynamics governed by \\( m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx} + F(t) \\). This means the subsequent position \\( x(T) \\) depends on the initial conditions, the nature and timing of \\( F(t) \\) and the change in the spring constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
