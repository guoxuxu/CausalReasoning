  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), with constants a and b. We assess the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) under different transformations and alterations to the original Laplace transform equation.\n\nIf we modify the constants a and b to a' and b' respectively, and then calculate the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + a's + b'} \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) at x = T be the same as the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T without any change to a and b?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constants a and b to a' and b' alters the poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), which affects the form of the inverse Laplace transform. Therefore, the time-domain representation \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) will differ from \\\\( z(x) \\\\), as these parameters directly influence the damping and oscillatory behavior of the resulting function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
