  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) describes the time evolution of a complex vector \\\\( w \\\\) under a complex transformation, where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation characterized by the operator \\\\( T(t) \\\\) which modifies the vector by \\\\( T(t)w = w + itAw \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( T(t) \\\\) was used during the evolution from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the use of \\\\( T(t) \\\\) purely from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible without additional information, as both the unmodified evolution \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) and potential modifications by \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at unknown points could lead to similar states at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
