  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a material is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal conductivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effect of an external heat source, which is modeled as \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\), added to specific points in the material at time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is given and evolves according to \\\\( u_t = k \\\\Delta u \\\\) without any external influence, will the temperature distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) was added at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the heat source function \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions or continuously influences the distribution, leading to a change in the heat equation's solution over time. Without this addition, the evolution is purely diffusive and follows different dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
