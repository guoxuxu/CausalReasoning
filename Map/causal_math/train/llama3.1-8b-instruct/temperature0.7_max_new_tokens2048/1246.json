  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, and let \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) represent the potential at a point (x, y). The Fourier transformation is applied to \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\(U(k, y)\\\\) dependent on wavenumber k and y.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original potential distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from the transformed potential \\\\(U(k, Y)\\\\) observed at y = Y using inverse Fourier transform without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Under the assumptions of linearity and absence of sources or sinks, the Fourier transformation and its inverse are sufficient to recover \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) from \\\\(U(k, Y)\\\\), assuming the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) solely determines the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
