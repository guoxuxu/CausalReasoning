  "Problem": "In a system analyzed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator, examine the impact of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nHaving observed the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely deduce the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of any transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Provided there are no transformations changing the initial state, and assuming no information loss through evolution, the inverse Fourier transform can be used to uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from its state at any later time, due to the reversible nature of the Fourier transform paired with the linear evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
