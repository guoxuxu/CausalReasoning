  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z \\) to \\( z' = z + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant, and then \\( g(z') \\) is computed, does the outcome heavily rely on the original \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) values?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( z' = z + c \\) adds a constant to the nonlinear combination of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), but since \\( g(z) = e^{z} \\) is highly sensitive to changes in \\( z \\), the outcome of \\( g(z') \\) still heavily relies on the initial values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), affecting the base value of \\( z \\) from which \\( c \\) is added.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
