  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a dynamic process in the complex plane. The function is initially transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. Then, the system evolves according to the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Bz \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention through function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend primarily on \\\\( B \\\\) and neither on \\\\( A \\\\) nor on \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of the complex function starting at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) which translates the state according to \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Therefore, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) is influenced by the compounded effects of A, B, and C through their respective transformations, leading to a state dependent on multiple factors, not just \\\\( B \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
