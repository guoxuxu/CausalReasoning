  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( r(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant different from \\\\( a \\\\)) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( q(x) \\\\), will the new Fourier transform at any time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the Fourier transforms of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or include influences from both \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( r(x) \\\\) adds another Gaussian modification, resulting in a function \\\\( s(x) = r(x)q(x) = e^{-bx^2}e^{-ax^2}h(x) \\\\). The convolution principles apply, affecting the Fourier transform of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) with both modifications \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\) includes influences of both transforming functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
