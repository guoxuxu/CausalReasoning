  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then modifying the function using another transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a transfer function in the s-domain.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is calculated and then directly used to find the inverse Laplace transform without applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will we retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it originally was?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse without any modification by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will result in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), since the Laplace transform is a linear operator and has an inverse that perfectly reconstructs the original function when not altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
