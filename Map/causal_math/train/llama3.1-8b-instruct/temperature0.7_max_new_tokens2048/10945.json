  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) up until t = T, will \\( z(T) \\) be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) without the transformation \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying \\( f(z) \\), \\( z_0 \\) is initially scaled by \\( e^{k0} = 1 \\), but as \\( t \\) progresses, the factor \\( e^{kt} \\) modifies the trajectory by adding an exponential growth or decay dependent on the real part of \\( k \\). This results in a different value for \\( z(T) \\) than without the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
