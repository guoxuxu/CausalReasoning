  "Problem": "Consider the time evolution of a quantum state in the presence of a magnetic field. Let the system be described by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system affected by the magnetic field B, given as \\\\( H = -\\\\gamma \\\\vec{B} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{S} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) being the gyromagnetic ratio and \\\\( \\\\vec{S} \\\\) the spin operator. The transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{-i\\\\theta S_z} \\\\psi \\\\) represents a rotation around the z-axis by an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) modifies the initial quantum state by rotating it about the z-axis, potentially changing its response to the magnetic field unless the magnetic field is aligned exclusively along the z-axis. This initial state modification dictates that subsequent evolution under H will generally lead to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
