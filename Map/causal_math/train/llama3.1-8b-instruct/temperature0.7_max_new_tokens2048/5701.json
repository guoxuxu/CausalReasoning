  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing the angular frequency and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an initially real-valued function. The impact of Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is studied to understand its transformation properties and the system behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by multiplying by a constant real number k (without any further functional transformations) and the system is allowed to evolve, will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) be directly proportional to the original transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by a constant k modifies the Laplace transform by the same factor k since Laplace transform of a scaled function is the scaled transform, i.e., \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{k u(t)\\} = k \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = kZ(s) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) is directly proportional to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by factor k.",
