  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation system defined by \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x K(x,t) y(t) dt \\\\) where K is a kernel function involving complex operations. We evaluate the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(x) \\\\) resulting from a kernel of unknown form, is it possible to determine unequivocally whether \\\\( K \\\\) or \\\\( K' \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the form of the kernel solely based on output \\\\( y(x) \\\\) is generally implausible without additional information, as multiple kernels can yield similar or even the same results under certain conditions. The effect of the complex exponential, specifically, can be masked by other factors in the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
