  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\\n\nIf \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without further alteration to the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), does the Laplace transform inherently account for all properties introduced by the factor \\\\( e^{ax^2} \\\\) in \\\\( z(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform directly incorporates and transforms any modifications introduced by the function \\\\( e^{ax^2} \\\\) into the new domain. Therefore, it fully accounts for the impact of this factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "alteration of z(x) → computation of F(s); e^(ax^2) → alteration of z(x); F(s) → Laplace transform; alteration of z(x) → z(x) = F(s); computation of F(s) → z(x) = F(s)"
