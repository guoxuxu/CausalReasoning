  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate how the integral transformation \\\\( F[z(t)] = \\int_0^T e^{-Ct}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with C as another constant matrix, impacts this system over time T.\n\nIf \\\\( F[z(t)] \\\\) is computed after allowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve from initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\) up to time T under the given differential equations, will the result of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) be equivalent to directly integrating \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with no transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( F[z(t)] \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{-Ct} \\\\), which weights different parts of the trajectory differently compared to a simple integration. The functional form and influence of C significantly change the integration outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
