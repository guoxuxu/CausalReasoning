  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u, denoted as \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))(s)\\\\), on the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) was transformed at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) initially changes the representation of the system to the frequency domain. The evolution under L and subsequent transformation to the frequency domain at time T potentially yields different results due to the differential properties of L in the time and frequency domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
