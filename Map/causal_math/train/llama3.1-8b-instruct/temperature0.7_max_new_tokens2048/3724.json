  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the impact of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) applied at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations or interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved through different sequences or magnitudes of interventions, especially due to different possible values for \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). The overlap in potential trajectories and the superposition of effects from \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) make it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions based solely on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
