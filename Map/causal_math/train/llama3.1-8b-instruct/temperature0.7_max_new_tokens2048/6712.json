  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a transformation given by \\\\( g(u) = (Tf)(u) \\\\), where \\\\( Tf \\\\) represents a Fourier transform over a function f modifying u.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\) or both) were applied prior to reaching \\\\( u(T) \\\\), only using the information of the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations applied to the system based solely on the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is challenging as different sequences of transformations can result in similar or identical final states, especially given the overlapping effects of the transforms on the system’s characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
