  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a set of linear algebraic equations driven by a matrix function \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), where A is a diagonalizable matrix. We further examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At}X(t) dt \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to the matrix \\\\( X_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\) until time T, will the resultant matrix \\\\( X(T) \\\\) be identical to that obtained by direct evolution of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) under the same equation without applying \\\\( g(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(X) \\\\) initially influences the system by altering the state with an integral transformation. This change in the system's initial condition indirectly modifies the evolution path of \\\\( X(t) \\\\), which will generally result in a different matrix at time T compared to the state obtained without applying \\\\( g(X) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
