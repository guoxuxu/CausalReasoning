  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) in a material is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T\\\\), where \\\\(k > 0\\\\) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material. We examine the effect of an external heating function \\\\( h(t) = H e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant heat input.\n\nGiven the temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) observed at time T, can we deduce that the heating function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied without any prior knowledge of external interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the heating function was applied, the observed temperature could be influenced by other factors like initial conditions or even other non-modeled heat sources. The same temperature profile could occur from different combinations of conditions and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
