  "Problem": "In a controlled heat transfer system, the temperature function, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to the function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution is modified using the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile at any later time t, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), be predictable solely based on the unaltered heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the modification of the initial temperature by \\\\( f(x) \\\\), the resulting temperature distribution at any later time will not solely depend on the heat equation's inherent properties. The alteration introduced by \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) fundamentally changes the initial conditions and thus alters the system's evolution over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
