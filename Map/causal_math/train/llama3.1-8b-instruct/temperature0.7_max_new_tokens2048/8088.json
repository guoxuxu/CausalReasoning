  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. The system's behavior is further explored through the application of a transformation represented by \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively identify the specific interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations and timings of applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or even other transformations not considered. The potential for overlapping effects and equivalent outcomes from different intervention sequences makes unique determination infeasible without additional context or data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
