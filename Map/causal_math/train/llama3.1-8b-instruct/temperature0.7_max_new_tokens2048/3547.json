  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by a complex multiplication by \\\\( c \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), altering the function to become \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\), will the function at T > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation under \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) fundamentally modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by transforming it to \\\\( cz(t_1) \\\\). Thus, the future values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend not only on \\\\( D \\\\) but also on the scaling and rotation introduced by \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
