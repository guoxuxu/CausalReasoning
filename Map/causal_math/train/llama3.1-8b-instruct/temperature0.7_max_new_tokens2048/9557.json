  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system modeled by \\( Ax = b \\) for a vector \\( x \\) and matrix \\( A \\), involving transformations by a function \\( f(x) = Mx \\) where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We assess causal impacts in the presence of this transformation.\n\nIf the transformation \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) solving \\( Ax = b \\), and then the system evolves naturally without further intervention, will the solution \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) still satisfy \\( Ax = b \\) without alterations to \\( A \\) or \\( b \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(x) \\) to \\( x_0 \\) modifies \\( x_0 \\) to \\( Mx_0 \\). Unless \\( M \\) is an identity or commutes in a specific way with \\( A \\), the product \\( AMx_0 \\) will not necessarily equal \\( b \\), changing the end condition of the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
