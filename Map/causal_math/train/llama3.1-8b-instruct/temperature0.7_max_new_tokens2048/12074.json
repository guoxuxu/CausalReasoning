  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and matrices A, B, C, and D are constants. We investigate the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) for a constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original differential equations and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not depend exclusively on the original differential equations since both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) influence the trajectory by modifying the scale and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect a compounded effect of these transformations on the original dynamics of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
