  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at z = 0 be reconstructed exactly from observing the result at z = Z after applying the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral transformation adds an accumulation of the function over an interval, it modifies the original function's output in an irreversible way that does not allow exact backward reconstruction without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
