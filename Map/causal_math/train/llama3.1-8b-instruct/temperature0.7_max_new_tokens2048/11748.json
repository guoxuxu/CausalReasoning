  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nIf \\( L(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to T under \\( \\dot{x} \\) and \\( \\dot{y} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\( L(z) \\) changes the complex number, affecting how it evolves under the differential equations. The transformation by \\( e^{Mt} \\) can alter both magnitude and phase, leading to a different position in the complex plane at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
