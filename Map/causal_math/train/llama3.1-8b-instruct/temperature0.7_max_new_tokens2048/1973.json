  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is computed at time t = 0 for an initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without additional transformation, will \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) to T and then applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution under the operator L and the Fourier transform commute owing to the linearity and time-invariance of L, assuming \\\\(L\\\\) is a constant-coefficient differential operator. Therefore, evolving first and then transforming gives the same result as transforming first and then evolving.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
