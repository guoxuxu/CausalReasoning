  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nCan we retrieve the exact original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from the state at time T, \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), if the initial condition was modified by a Fourier transform and no information about the transform is available?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge about the application of the Fourier transform obfuscates the original state. The evolution under the PDE further disperses any straightforward linkage between \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) and \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\\\) even more so due to the diffusive nature of the telegraph equation which blends and spreads initial characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → modified initial condition; modified initial condition → PDE; PDE → u(x,T); u(x,T) → initial condition retrieval; initial condition retrieval → availability of information; lack of information about the transform → no retrieval of initial condition"
