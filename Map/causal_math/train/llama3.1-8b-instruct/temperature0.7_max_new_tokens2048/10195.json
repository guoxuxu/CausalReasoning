  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}B u(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and u(t) is a control input. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform on the control signal u(t), denoted as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\), and its impact on the transformed system output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies matrix A to A' at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformed output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) at s = s_1 relate only to the initial matrix A and not the modified A'?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that changes matrix A to A' adjusts the dynamics of the system post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\). This alteration means the system's response and hence the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s_1) \\\\) will incorporate the effects of both A and A' based on when the change occurs relative to the behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
