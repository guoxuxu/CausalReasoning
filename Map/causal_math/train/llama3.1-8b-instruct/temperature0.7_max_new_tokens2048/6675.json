  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the matrix is switched from \\\\( M \\\\) to another matrix \\\\( N \\\\), will the trajectory \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original motion \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on the transformational history from \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The switch from \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\( N \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a discontinuity or alteration in the transformation path, making the final trajectory of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), but critically on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). The resulting path directly reflects the influence of both matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
