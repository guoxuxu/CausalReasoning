  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) post-intervention, can we conclusively identify whether transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\), intervention \\\\( H(w) \\\\), or both were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities added by the transformations \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( H(w) = e^{aw} \\\\), which could significantly alter the properties of the contour and the function values, it's challenging to reverse engineer and precisely identify what transformations or interventions were used based on the integral alone. Multiple transformation combinations could lead to the same or indistinguishable results in the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
