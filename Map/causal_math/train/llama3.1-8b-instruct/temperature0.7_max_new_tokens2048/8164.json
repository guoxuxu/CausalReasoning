  "Problem": "In a controlled heat transfer system, the temperature function, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to the function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the observed temperature profile \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) at a particular time \\\\( T \\\\), can one determine whether either \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both were used just by analyzing \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in the effects caused by \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and their modification of the system's dynamics, makes it challenging to identify distinctly which modifications were applied just from the end temperature profile. Thus, deducing the specific interventions used solely based on the resultant temperature at time \\\\( T \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
