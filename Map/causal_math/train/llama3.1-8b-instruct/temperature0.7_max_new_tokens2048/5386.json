  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The investigation involves examining the effects of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and its impact over the function transformation through \\\\\n\nCan the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) of the function be known by observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) was applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to determine the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) accurately as the function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) modifies the amplitude and potentially the phase of the original function, therefore obstructing direct back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
