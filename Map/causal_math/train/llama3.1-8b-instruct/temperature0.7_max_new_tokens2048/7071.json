  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L}q = 0 \\), where \\( q(t) \\) is the charge, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( L \\) is the inductance. Let's analyze the effect of introducing a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) and its impact on the steady-state solution of the system.\n\nIf at a midway time point \\( t_1 \\), we introduce an additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) that affects the resistance, \\( R \\rightarrow R + \\lambda \\), will the steady-state of \\( q(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the updated resistance?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with an additional damping factor \\( \\lambda \\) changes the characteristics of resistance, but the steady-state response continues to be a function of both the damped resistance and the parameters of the voltage source \\( V_0 \\) and \\( \\omega \\). Thus, the updated steady-state depends on multiple factors including the original system properties and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
