  "Problem": "Consider a complex mapping scenario given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, over the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( g \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) = z + b \\\\) at a certain point after applying \\\\( g \\\\), will \\\\( f(h(g(z_0))) \\\\) be independent of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final function expression will be \\\\( f(h(g(z_0))) = e^{z_0 + a + b} \\\\), clearly showing dependence on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The transformation by \\\\( g \\\\) followed by \\\\( h \\\\) incrementally shifts \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the resulting output of \\\\( f \\\\) is dependent on the sequential application of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
