  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we examine the flow of an incompressible fluid using the Navier-Stokes equations in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The equations are given by \\\\(\\\\rho (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\mathbf{u}) = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\mu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the fluid density, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of manipulating the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as an external intervention.\n\nGiven the velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(T)\\\\) at some final time T, can it be established definitively what changes were made to the external force or viscosity at an earlier time \\\\(t_1\\\\) based on the velocity field alone?",
  "Explanation": "The velocity field at time T, being influenced by multiple interacting factors and their initial conditions, does not uniquely determine the specific nature or timing of changes in external forces or viscosity. Multiple possible combinations of conditions could lead to the same final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
