  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nIf we deform the original contour to a different shape that still encloses \\\\( a \\\\) and integrate \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the integral value change?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the contour integral of a function around a singularity is dependent solely on the residues of the function at the points enclosed and not on the shape of the contour, as long as none of the singularities are crossed. Thus, if the modified contour still encloses the same singularity \\\\( a \\\\), the integral's value remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
