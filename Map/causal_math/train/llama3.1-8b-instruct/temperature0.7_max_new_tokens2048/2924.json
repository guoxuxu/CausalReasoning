  "Problem": "Assume we are analyzing a thermal system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = \\\\Delta u + c u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the temperature distribution in a medium, \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\(c\\\\) is a heat source term. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which changes the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine specifically what interventions were applied (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u)\\\\), or both) based solely on the frequency domain profile \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) observed at the time T?",
  "Explanation": "The final frequency domain profile may result from different combinations of interventions and initial conditions. The effects of phase shifts and modifications by Fourier transform and other interventions in the frequency domain could overlap, making it challenging to parse out the specifics of each intervention solely from observing the final outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
