  "Problem": "Explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are distinct constant matrices. We assess the results when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nBased on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = T, is it possible to retrieve the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge about whether or not \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have changed the original state in a manner that is not reversible solely through the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
