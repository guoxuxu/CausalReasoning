  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real frequency. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) adds another complex scaling factor which, together with \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), influences the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) does depend on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), along with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
