  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We examine the impact of a transformation by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, on the system's evolution.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the change in magnitude due to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) makes it impossible to determine the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as both magnitude and phase details originating solely from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) are obscured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
