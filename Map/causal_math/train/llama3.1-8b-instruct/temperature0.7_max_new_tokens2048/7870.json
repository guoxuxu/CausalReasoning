  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform in the context of varying parameters \\\\( s \\\\). We analyze how complex functions and integral transformations relate in the inference of causality.\n\nCan we infer the original matrix A after observing the outcome of the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\) at some time T without any prior information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge about the function application \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the results of the Laplace transform may be similar under different matrices A when interacting with varied complex inputs, making it challenging to uniquely determine A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
