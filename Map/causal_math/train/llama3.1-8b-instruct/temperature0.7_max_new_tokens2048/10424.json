  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\,dt\\\\) on this system.\n\nKnowing the final form of the Laplace transform after an unknown intervention, can we definitively identify whether \\\\(R\\\\) was changed or if only \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) was altered?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform aggregates information in a way that certain details about individual parameters (like amplitude vs. frequency changes) can be obscured. Without prior information about the nature of the intervention, distinguishing between modifications to \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) from the transform alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
