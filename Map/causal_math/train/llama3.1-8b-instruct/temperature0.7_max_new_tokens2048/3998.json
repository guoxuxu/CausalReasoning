  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by the Laplace operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s)\\\\), examining the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and its transformation \\\\\\\\(( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\)). We then intervene by applying a transformation through the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{t}f(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\), can we unequivocally determine that the original function was \\\\( t^2 \\\\) without any other inputs?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) is uniquely \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) when considering standard initial conditions (e.g., no impulses at t=0). Therefore, we can infer the exact original function assuming standard conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
