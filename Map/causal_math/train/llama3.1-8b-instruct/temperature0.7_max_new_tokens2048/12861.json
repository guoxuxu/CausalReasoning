  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are variables transformed via integral transformations applied as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\) using the Laplace transform. The transformed function is expressed as \\\\( Z(s) = F(X(s), Y(s)) \\\\). We analyze how these transformations affect the relationships and dependencies between the original functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we conclusively determine the exact original functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone, knowing that no interventions were made after applying \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse transformation from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) does not uniquely determine \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) due to possible non-unique inverses and loss of information about initial conditions or specific forms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
