  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 u = f(x, y)\\\\) on a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) with boundary conditions applied. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to analyze the effects and causal relationships of applying different boundary interventions.\n\nIf the source term \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) is changed from \\\\(f_1(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(f_2(x, y)\\\\) at time 0, without any further modification to the boundary conditions of \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), will the solution \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) at time T exactly correspond to one generated by directly solving the Poisson equation with \\\\(f_2(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution of the Poisson equation under a changed source term, assuming unchanged boundary conditions, directly corresponds to effects from the new source term by solving \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 u = f_2(x, y)\\\\). The linearity of the Poisson equation implies that the solution directly evolves in response to the change in source terms without residual effects from the previous state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
