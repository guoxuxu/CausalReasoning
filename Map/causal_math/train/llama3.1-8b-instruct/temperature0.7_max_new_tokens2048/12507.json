  "Problem": "In this setting, we analyze the behavior of a function z(t) defined in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Bw \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we ascertain precisely which sequence of transformations and interventions (in terms of applying \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\) and/or \\\\( u(t) = e^{Ct}w(t) \\\\)) occurred by observing only the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known, deducing the exact nature and sequence of the transformations and interventions can lead to different possibilities due to their non-commutative interactions and similar effects on the trajectory and magnitude of the complex function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Disentangling these influences based solely on end states without additional contextual information is generally not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
