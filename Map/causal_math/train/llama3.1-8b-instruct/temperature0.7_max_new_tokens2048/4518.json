  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of z(t) shows an increased magnitude at \\\\( \\omega = 0 \\\\), can we infer that a constant value was added to z(t) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "An increase at \\\\( \\omega = 0 \\\\) in the Fourier transform directly signifies an added constant in the time domain. This increase corresponds to the integral of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, indicating a uniform shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "constant addition at t = 0 → increase in magnitude at ω = 0; Fourier transform → increase in magnitude at ω = 0; increase in magnitude at ω = 0 → constant value at t = 0; t = 0 → constant value at t = 0; constant value at t = 0 → Fourier transform"
