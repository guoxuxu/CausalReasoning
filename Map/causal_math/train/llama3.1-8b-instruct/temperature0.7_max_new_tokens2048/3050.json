  "Problem": "Let us consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z' = i \\omega z\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function of time, \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\(T(z) = z e^{i \\theta t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is a constant real shift in frequency.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t=0\\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation application, it is impossible to resolve whether the observed motion results from a natural evolution at frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) or at an altered frequency \\\\(\\omega + \\theta\\\\). The initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) remains indeterminable due to potential frequency shifts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
