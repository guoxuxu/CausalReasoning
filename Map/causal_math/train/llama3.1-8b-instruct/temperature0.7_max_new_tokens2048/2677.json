  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} + Bz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant complex numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The situation investigates the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f(z)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over a period T.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T[f(z)] \\\\) without any modification to parameters A, B, or s, will the resulting transformation purely represent the effect of the initial values of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( T[f(z)] \\\\) integrates the influence of the exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) which affects how features of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) contribute to the integral, particularly how different the contributions from \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) and \\\\( Bz \\\\) are. This introduces dependencies on both the values of A and B as well as on the decay parameter s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
