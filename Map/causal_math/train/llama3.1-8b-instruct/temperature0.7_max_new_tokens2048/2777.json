  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\(k\\\\) is increased by 1, resulting in a new function \\\\(u'(z) = z^{k+1}\\\\), and we compute the integral \\\\(I'(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u'(z) dz\\\\) without any other changes, will \\\\(I'(t)\\\\) evolve exactly as \\\\(I(t)\\\\) if \\\\(k\\\\) had not been changed?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the power of \\\\(z\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\) to \\\\(u'(z)\\\\) changes the nature of the function within the integral, contributing an additional factor of \\\\(z\\\\) which alters the contour integration results. This can significantly modify the evaluated integral, thereby affecting how \\\\(I'(t)\\\\) evolves compared to \\\\(I(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
