  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled with Laplace transforms in the complex function space, where the transfer function H(s) relates the input U(s) to the output Y(s) by Y(s) = H(s)U(s). Let's investigate how the addition of a complex pole affects the system behavior.\n\nIf at some s = s_0 we artificially modify U(s) such that it compensates for the effect of the added pole (by multiplying U(s) with 1/(s-p) at s_0), will the original Y(s) under the unchanged H(s) be entirely restored across all s?",
  "Explanation": "Although compensating at a specific point s_0 can locally counterbalance the pole effect, it does not guarantee restoration of the original Y(s) for all s, due to the global alteration of the system's complex plane structure and the response variation at other points.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
