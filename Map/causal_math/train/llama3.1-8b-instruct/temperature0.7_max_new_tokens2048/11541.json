  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the system is allowed to evolve under the given PDE without any further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to time \\\\(T\\\\) under the same PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform alters the representation of the system from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. Even though the inverse Fourier transform can theoretically recover the original state, the practical computation and any numerical errors or assumptions in handling the transform can alter the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
