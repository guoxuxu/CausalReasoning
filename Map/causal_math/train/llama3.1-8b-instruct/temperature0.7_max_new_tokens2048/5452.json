  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at a certain time, is it possible to determine whether an intervention altered the matrix M during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether an intervention occurred from \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) alone is complex because multiple potential interventions (changes to the matrix) could yield equivalent transformations in the Laplace domain. Without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely attribute changes in \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) to specific modifications in M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
