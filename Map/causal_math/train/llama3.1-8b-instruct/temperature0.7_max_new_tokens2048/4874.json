  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a certain domain with prescribed boundary conditions. Suppose an operator \\\\( T: u(x) \\\\mapsto u(x) + c \\\\cos(x) \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied externally.\n\nKnowing the field \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), and without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the original state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation applied by \\\\( T \\\\), it would be impossible to deduce whether the added \\\\( c \\\\cos(x) \\\\) term was part of the original solution or introduced by the operator, as both scenarios could lead to the observed \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
