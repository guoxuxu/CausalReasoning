  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) over time t in the complex plane, and its response under the linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = kz \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint exactly whether the transformations \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both were applied, based only on the observed value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations by k and r, both being multiplicative scalars, could have been applied in various combinations (or not at all if k or r equals 1) to result in the same final observed value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The periodic and rotational nature of the exponential function in the complex plane allows multiple possible series of transformations to lead to an indistinguishable endpoint, making it difficult to identify distinct paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
