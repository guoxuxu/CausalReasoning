  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of a transformation given by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform with respect to time t) is studied.\n\nIf an intervention involving a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) modifies the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), applying \\\\( G(u) = e^{Mt}u(x,t) \\\\), will the transformed state \\\\( F(u)(x, s) \\\\) at any s depend only on L and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) = e^{Mt}u(x,t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics governed by M, which affects how the function evolves before being transformed by \\\\( F(u) \\\\). The final Laplace transform representation at any s is dependent on both the initial operator L and the intervention M, altering the transformed state in a way that is not dictated solely by L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
