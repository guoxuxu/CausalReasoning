  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the impact of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) applied at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) due to the effect of each transformation and integration modifying the solution and trajectory, significantly affecting the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
