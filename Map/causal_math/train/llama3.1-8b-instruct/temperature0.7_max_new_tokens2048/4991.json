  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) applied to a function \\( f(x) \\). We analyze various scenarios where \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\), and ‘a’ is a real constant, to understand the impact of this transformation on the system.\n\nIf a different modulation \\( h(x) = e^{bx}f(x) \\) is applied as an intervention at some time \\( t_1 \\), will the resulting Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) remain unchanged from the \\( F(k) \\) before \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the new modulation \\( h(x) \\) introduces an additional frequency shift described by \\( b \\), which alters \\( F(k) \\) as it evolves. The end result \\( F(k) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) is influenced by both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), causing the Fourier Transform to deviate further from the original without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
