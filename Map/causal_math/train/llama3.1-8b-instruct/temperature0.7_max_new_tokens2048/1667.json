  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} \\\\) is introduced and convolved sequentially after \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the resulting function after both convolutions depend solely on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any influence from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential convolution with both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in a series of transformations that modify the original function. The effects of each kernel are compounded, thereby influencing the final outcome, which will reflect characteristics of both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as well as \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
