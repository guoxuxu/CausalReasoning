  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\( D \\\\) being a constant matrix characterizing the system dynamics and \\\\( C \\\\) being the control matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) is defined, where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\) with a constant control input \\\\( u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Ft}x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which changes the trajectory of the system. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) potentially alters how the dynamics governed by \\\\( D \\\\) and the control \\\\( C \\\\) affect the state's evolution, therefore leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
