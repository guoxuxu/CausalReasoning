  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), with \\\\( Q \\\\) being another constant matrix, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of a new function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is a different constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1 be influenced only by \\\\( P \\\\), and not by \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) as an intervention during the system's evolution adds another level of complexity. The trajectory and the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will be influenced by the interactions between \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( R \\\\), due to the compounded effects of these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
