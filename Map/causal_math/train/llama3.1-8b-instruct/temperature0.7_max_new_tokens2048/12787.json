  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) under transformation by a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) described by the integral transform \\\\(L(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt\\\\) over some interval. Assess how the behavior and interpretation of z changes when subjected directly or through transformation L.\n\nGiven observations of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) after several transformations with \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\), can we determine with certainty which transformations were applied specifically, and in what sequence, based solely on the observed \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of integral transformations and their potentially non-commutative nature when combined, identifying specific transformations and their sequence purely from the outcome \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is non-trivial and typically not unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
