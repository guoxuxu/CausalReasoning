  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nWill the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) without any further transformations yield a function primarily characterized by the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), which is \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{e^{az}\\\\}(k) \\\\), yields a function that is dependent on the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), typically resulting in a function involving shifts and scalings based on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( a \\\\). The result is inherently tied to the characteristics of \\\\( a \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
