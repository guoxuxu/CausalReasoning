  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function transformation on a real function g(x) over the domain [0, 1]. The transformation is defined by T(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(iπsx) g(s) ds, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the resultant function at x = 1 after transformations T and U, can one determine precisely which transformations (T or U or both) were applied, based solely on the output at x = 1?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether T, U, or both were applied based on the output at x = 1 is inherently complex due to the integral and exponential nature of both transformations. Both can influence the resultant value in overlapping ways, making discrete identification based solely on final output challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation T → Imaginary Unit i; Transformation U → Imaginary Unit i; Transformation T → Function g(x); Transformation U → Function g(x); Imaginary Unit i → Exponential e^(iπsx); Exponential e^(iπsx) → Integral ∫_0^1; Integral ∫_0^1 → Resultant Function at x = 1; Resultant Function at x = 1 → Output at x = 1"
