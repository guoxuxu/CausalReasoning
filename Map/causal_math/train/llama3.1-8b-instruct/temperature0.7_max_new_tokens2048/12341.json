  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nGiven the frequency spectrum \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) without knowing the original function, can we deduce that \\( z(t) \\) was \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) uniquely results in a Dirac delta function precisely at \\( \\omega \\), \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\xi) \\). The unique correspondence allows us to deduce the original function \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) from its spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
