  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nIf a second transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) depend solely on the initial phase shift \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) provided by \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\). The total phase shift observed in the Fourier transform will be a combination of both \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), influenced by the temporal ordering and specifics of how and when \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied. The resulting Fourier transform is dependent on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
