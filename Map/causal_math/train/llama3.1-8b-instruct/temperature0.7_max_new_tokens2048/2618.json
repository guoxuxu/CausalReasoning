  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the Fourier transform was applied to \\\\( K(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the nature of the kernel transformation (Fourier transform in this case) is unknown, the deconvolution problem can be ill-posed, meaning that without knowing the form of \\\\( K(t) \\\\) after transformation, accurately retrieving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
