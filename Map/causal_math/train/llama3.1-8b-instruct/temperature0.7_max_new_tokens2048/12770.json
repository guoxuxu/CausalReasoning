  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and s is a complex parameter. We explore the causal inference between varying the parameter s and its effect on the transformed function F(s).\n\nIf we intervene by changing the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t^2 \\\\) to \\\\( 2t^2 \\\\) at time t = 0 while keeping s constant, will this change the value of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) regardless of the initial or final value of s?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) directly changes the integrand of the transformation, substantially affecting \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by scaling it by a factor directly related to the change in \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Since the function has been doubled, so will the value of the integral, independent of the value of s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
