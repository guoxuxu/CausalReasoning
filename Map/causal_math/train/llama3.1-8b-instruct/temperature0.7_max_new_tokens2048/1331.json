  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), another function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) be influenced solely by the original function without accounting for \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), making the endpoint \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) influenced by the initial function, the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The complex functions \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) alter magnitudes and/or phases, contributing to a distinct final state at \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
