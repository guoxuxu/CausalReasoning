  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) exactly after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T without knowing the action of operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of how the operator L transforms under the Fourier transform (i.e., what \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(L)\\\\) is), we cannot uniquely determine \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\). Knowledge of L is crucial for accurately tracing back from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
