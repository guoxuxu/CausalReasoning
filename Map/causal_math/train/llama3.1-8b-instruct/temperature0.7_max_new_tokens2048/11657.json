  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit system where the voltage across a capacitor (V) is related to the charge (Q) by the relation \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) where C is the capacitance. Additionally, a sinusoidal input voltage is transformed by a Laplace transformation, resulting in a transformed output that is affected by the system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the system starts with a certain charge Q0 and the Laplace transform of a sinusoidal input is applied without further manual alteration of C, will the output voltage V(t) at t = T be the same as if Q0 has been directly allowed to influence V(t) under \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) without the sinusoidal input?",
  "Explanation": "The sinusoidal input, once transformed and applied to the system, changes the way charge is distributed across the circuit, thereby altering the voltage V(t) from what would be determined solely by Q0 and C in a static scenario. The system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies these dynamics further.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
