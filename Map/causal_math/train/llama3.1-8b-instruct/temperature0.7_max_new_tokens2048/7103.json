  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time t under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lz = z' + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of \\\\( z \\\\) with respect to t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( U(z) = z + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( a \\\\) and not on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( U(z) \\\\) instantaneously shifts the state of \\\\( z \\\\) and thereby affects the subsequent trajectory under the operator \\\\( L \\\\). Hence, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the original linear transformation rule via \\\\( a \\\\) and the new intervention \\\\( c \\\\), resulting in a state that cannot be attributed to \\\\( a \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
