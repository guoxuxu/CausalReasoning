  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane \\\\( z \\\\) described by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. We explore the effects on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) when \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a linear function \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we determine the original value of \\\\( z \\\\) straight from the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further data on the parameters of \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral transformation and the alterations induced by \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\), recovering the exact original \\\\( z \\\\) from \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) is not possible as multiple candidates for \\\\( z \\\\) could yield the same or indistinguishable outputs in complex function dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
