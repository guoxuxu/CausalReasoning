  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are fixed matrices. Analyze how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) as another constant matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when applied at different stages.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to an altered exponential trajectory due to the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). This change in trajectory will result in a different outcome at time T compared to the unaltered trajectory starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
