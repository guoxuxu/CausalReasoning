  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nIf an intervening function \\\\( h(x,t) = e^{Nt}u \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), where T > t_1, entirely depend on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent state transformation due to \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) involves another exponential factor \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\), which would affect the evolution past \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The final state is influenced by M used initially, the operator L, and the intervention through N, creating dependencies on all these components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
