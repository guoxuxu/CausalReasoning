  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nFollowing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\), if we allow the system to evolve naturally without further modification, will the inverse Fourier transform retrieve the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it would develop under the initial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), which is \\\\( z(t) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty F(z)e^{i\\\\omega t} d\\\\omega \\\\), precisely retrieves the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Given the linear and time-invariant nature of the differential equation, the evolution post-transformation will faithfully follow the prescribed dynamics without alteration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
