  "Problem": "Consider a system that is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( v \\\\) is a vector field representing velocity. We investigate how performing a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), affects the evolution of the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can one unequivocally identify if and how \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) was applied during the interval 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexity and potential multiple forms of \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) that can yield mathematically similar results in \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), it's not feasible to uniquely identify the specific intervention or its effect simply by observing the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
