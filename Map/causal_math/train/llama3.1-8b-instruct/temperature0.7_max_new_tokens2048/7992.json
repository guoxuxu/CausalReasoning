  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the trajectory's representation in the complex plane at time t = T, can we precisely deduce if interventions such as \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both, were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affect only the rate of traversal but not the path, multiple combinations of n and m can lead to the same frequency at time T. Therefore, we cannot uniquely identify the specific transformations or their sequence just by observing the final frequency or state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
