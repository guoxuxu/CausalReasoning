  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as a complex exponential \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which undergoes transformations under various operations mapped in a complex function space. The transformations are represented by the operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Lz(t) = e^{kt}z(t) \\\\) for some real constant k, and \\\\( M \\\\) as \\\\( Mz(t) = e^{ht}z(t) \\\\) with h being another real constant.\n\nGiven the final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively identify the sequence of transformations (involvement of either or both L and M) experienced by the system, purely based on the final form observed?",
  "Explanation": "Since both L and M modify the system in a similar exponential manner but with different constants, multiple combinations of k and h could result in the same or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, the exact path of transformations (L, M, both, or in different orders) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
