  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\beta s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant different from \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T depend only on the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce modifications that contribute to the final state, affecting both amplitude and phase. Therefore, the final state depends on \\\\( w \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), not solely on the natural frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The interplay between these parameters shapes the outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
