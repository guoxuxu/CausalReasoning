  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = K \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where K is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents a temperature distribution. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = u(x,t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) a positive constant, on the system dynamics over time.\n\nFrom observing the final state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\), can we determine the exact nature of the interventions used (such as the exact values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)), based only on the knowledge of the PDE and \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The extensive interactions and combined effects of \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), the diffusion process, and the added term \\\\( \\\\beta e^{-\\\\gamma t} \\\\) during the intervention create a highly complex system state at time T. These overlapping influences make it infeasible to isolate and identify specific values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) solely based on the final observable \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
