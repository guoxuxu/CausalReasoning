  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on this function over the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), ignoring the amplitude \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = x\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\\\), we can uniquely solve for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as it determines the pole location on the imaginary axis in the complex plane, independent of the amplitude \\\\( x \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
