  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant input voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and a resistive load R. A time-varying inductance \\\\( L(t) = L_0 e^{kt} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through the circuit over time.\n\nGiven the current measurement \\\\( I(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what components were added to the circuit, whether inductance was variable or constant, and whether a capacitor was introduced?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity introduced by time-dependence of the inductance and the potential inclusion of a capacitor, multiple configurations could lead to the same observed current \\\\( I(T) \\\\). Consequently, inferring the exact setup and changes from the endpoint alone is fraught with ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
