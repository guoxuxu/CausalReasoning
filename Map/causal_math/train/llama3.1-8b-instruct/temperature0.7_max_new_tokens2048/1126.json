  "Problem": "In a statistical framework, consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = X\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon \\\\), where \\\\( X \\\\) represents predictor variables matrix, \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) a coefficients vector, and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the error terms. We are examining the effect of a simultaneous linear transformation applied to both \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) through matrix \\\\( T \\\\) which affects the causality from predictors to response.\n\nGiven the transformed data \\\\( (X', z) \\\\) without the explicit knowledge of \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\), can we infer the original predictors \\\\( X \\\\) and coefficients \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\), it is not feasible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) from \\\\( X' \\\\). Transformation matrix \\\\( T \\\\) can have non-trivial null spaces or may not be invertible, leading to information loss about the original variables and coefficients.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
