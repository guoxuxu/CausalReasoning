  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) is used to describe the time evolution of a system in the complex plane, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\overline{z} \\\\) (complex conjugation) is applied, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on the initial squaring or time of conjugation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\overline{z} \\\\) as an intervention changes the trajectory again by reflecting the current state across the real axis. The final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both the initial squaring and the conjugation time, as each affects how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) progresses in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
