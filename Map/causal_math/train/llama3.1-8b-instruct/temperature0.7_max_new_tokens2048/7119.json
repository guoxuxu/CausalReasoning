  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) represent a transfer function in the Laplace transform domain, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We consider the impact of applying a sinusoidal input \\\\( x(t) = \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and an impulsive function \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as inputs into the system described by H(s).\n\nIf an impulse \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as an intervention is applied at a certain time \\\\( T \\\\), will the system's output \\\\( y(T + \\epsilon) \\\\) for small \\\\( \\epsilon > 0 \\\\) depend solely on the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on the sinusoidal input?",
  "Explanation": "The impulse intervention at \\\\( t = T \\\\) adds to the existing response of the sinusoidal input. Since the impulse generates a typically sharp and significant change in output at and around \\\\( t = T \\\\), the overall output will reflect contributions both from the continuous sinusoidal input and the discrete impact of the impulse.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
