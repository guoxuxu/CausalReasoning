  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( Z(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The function is analyzed in terms of its effects on integration along a contour in the complex plane. The path of integration, \\\\( C \\\\), is defined from point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\), can we infer the starting point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of the contour \\\\( C \\\\) without extra information about function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C Z(z) dz \\\\) depends on both the path and the function \\\\( Z(z) \\\\). Without precise knowledge of \\\\( Z(z) \\\\) or the nature of \\\\( C \\\\), deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_1 \\\\) just from the integral's value is not feasible, owing to the complex transformation dynamics of \\\\( Z(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
