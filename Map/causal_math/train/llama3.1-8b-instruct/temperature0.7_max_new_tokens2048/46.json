  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = pz + q\\\\), where p and q are complex constants. Examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s)ds\\\\) applied over time t, with s being a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the intervention (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied), the recovery of the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is not feasible. The integration and exponential factor in \\\\(T(z)\\\\) could obscure the true evolution path of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), making the retrospective analysis impossible to conduct accurately.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
