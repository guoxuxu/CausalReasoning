  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nIf the system is intervened by applying an additional transformation \\\\( U \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), such that \\\\( Ux = z \\\\), and then transforming back using \\\\( U^{-1}z = x \\\\) at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x \\\\) necessarily satisfy \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) regardless of the specifics of U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( U^{-1} \\\\) affects the trajectory and may alter the condition under which \\\\( x \\\\) solves \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). The change in basis may not preserve the particular solution due to properties of the transformation matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
