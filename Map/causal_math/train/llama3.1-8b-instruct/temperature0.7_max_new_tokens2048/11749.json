  "Problem": "Examine the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the coupled differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + By \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\) respectively. Consider the effect of the linear operator \\( L(z) = e^{Mt}z \\) where M is a constant matrix, applied at different intervals.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at T without knowing whether \\( L(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the existence or non-existence of the \\( L(z) \\) application, the possible alteration by the transformation \\( e^{Mt} \\) introduces uncertainty in back-calculating the original \\( z_0 \\). The alteration could have changed the dynamic system states in a non-recoverable way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
