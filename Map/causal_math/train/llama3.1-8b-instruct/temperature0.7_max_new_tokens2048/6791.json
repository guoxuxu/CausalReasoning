  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance \\\\(Z(s) = sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are the inductance and capacitance, respectively. The circuit's response to a voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is modeled by the transfer function \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}}\\\\). We examine the application of the Laplace Transform and its inverse to analyze the time domain and frequency domain behaviors.\n\nIf during the response, a linear transformer that changes the circuit's properties is introduced at time \\\\(t_0\\\\) affecting the inductance to \\\\(L'\\\\), will the resultant impedance in the s-domain remain as \\\\(Z(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a change in inductance to \\\\(L'\\\\) modifies the overall system's impedance, now represented as \\\\(Z'(s) = sL' + \\\\frac{1}{sC}\\\\). This change in the system dynamics due to intervention will alter the transfer function and hence affect the corresponding s-domain and time-domain responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
