  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an inverse Fourier transform followed by a specific filtering process is applied to \\( H(u, v) \\) as an intervention, is the resulting spatial domain function only dependent on the filtering process and not on the initial Fourier transform parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function in the spatial domain is influenced not only by the filtering process but also by the parameters of the initial Fourier transform. These parameters affect how \\( h(x, y) \\) was represented in \\( H(u, v) \\), and thus, the inverse transform and subsequent filtering will yield results that depend on both aspects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
