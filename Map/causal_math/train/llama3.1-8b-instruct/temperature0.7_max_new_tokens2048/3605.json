  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) not only alters the initial magnitude by multiplying with \\\\( e^{\\alpha t} \\\\), but also changes the trajectory's exponential growth or decay rate. Hence, the trajectory at time T is different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
