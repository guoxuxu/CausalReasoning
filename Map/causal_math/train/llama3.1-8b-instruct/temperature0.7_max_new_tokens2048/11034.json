  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( T \\\\) applied to the initial conditions over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation T was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of matrix T, any inference about the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is underdetermined because the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) could have modified the initial conditions in multiple possible ways, particularly if M and T do not have simple algebraic relations like commutativity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
