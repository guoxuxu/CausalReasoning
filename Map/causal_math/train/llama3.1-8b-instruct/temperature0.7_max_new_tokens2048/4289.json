  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system's natural evolution without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the natural system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the complex number by inducing a rotation dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and t. This rotational factor alters the trajectory from what would have been if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) simply followed the natural system’s evolution. Thus, the state at t = T will differ due to this initial phase shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
