  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the complex initial condition. We evaluate how the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant, affects the evolution over time.\n\nIf a new intervention by another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) is also a complex constant) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of another intervening function, \\\\( h(z) \\\\), further complicates the dynamics. The final state at time T depends on \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( F \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as each exponential factor collectively influences the trajectory and thus the end behavior of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
