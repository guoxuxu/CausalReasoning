  "Problem": "Consider a vector field represented by the function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) affects the field over time z, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the field, can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\) or both) were applied, by only knowing the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations applied is impractical solely from the final state due to the complex interaction of the exponentials in the transformations. Both transformations \\\\( e^{Bz} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Cz} \\\\) could yield similar endpoint effects, making identification ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
