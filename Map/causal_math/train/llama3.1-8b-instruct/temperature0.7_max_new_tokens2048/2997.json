  "Problem": "Investigate the scenario where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{Cx} \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is integrated into the dynamic determined by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\), D being another constant matrix. Analyze the evolution when the transformation \\\\( g(x) = z(x) * u(x) \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\) without further manipulations, will the state \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) redefines the initial state by multiplying each component by \\\\( e^{Cx} \\\\), which modifies the trajectory of the system. Since the exponential function can alter the dynamics significantly depending on C relative to D, the resulting state at any later time x = X will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
