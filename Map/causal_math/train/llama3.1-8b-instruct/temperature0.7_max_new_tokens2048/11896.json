  "Problem": "Consider a complex function in the form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) where x is a constant complex vector and A is a constant real matrix. We assess the behavior of the function after applying a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) begins as \\\\( e^{iAt}x \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves without further intervention under the Laplace transform, will the resulting transform space function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma differ from direct transformation at s = \\\\sigma assuming no initial application of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) affects the function greatly as it introduces oscillatory behavior, which shifts the frequency components in the Laplace domain. Transforming from the beginning with this exponential term changes the resulting function in the transform space compared to if it was not initially applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform application → function transformation; t = 0 → initial condition; evolution of z(t) → no change; initial application of e^(iAt) → change in initial condition"
