  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We explore the function behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[F](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} F(t) dt \\\\) with respect to the Laplace transform when \\\\( F(t) = f(t) \\\\) for t in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is transformed via the Laplace transform, will the outcome correctly predict the function's behavior as a decayed oscillation?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) by the Laplace transform contributes to a decay due to the exponential \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) in the transform. While \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) is purely oscillatory, the Laplace transform introduces a decay component, resulting in a correct prediction of decayed oscillation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
