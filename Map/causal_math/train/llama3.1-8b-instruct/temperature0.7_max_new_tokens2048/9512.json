  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the system under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix performing a linear transformation.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not uniquely specify the sequence or types of transformations that were applied due to the matrices' potential non-commutability and equivalence in resulting states by using different combinations of transformations. Therefore, without additional information, sorting out precise interventions used from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
