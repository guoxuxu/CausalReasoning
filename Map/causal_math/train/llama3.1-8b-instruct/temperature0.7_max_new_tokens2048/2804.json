  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is the initial condition vector. We explore the impact of the operator \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Ft}z \\\\), where R is a complex matrix function and F a constant matrix, applied over time t.\n\nGiven the final observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to distinctly identify whether the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( j(z) \\\\) or both were applied simply based on the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is impracticable. The behaviors of matrix exponentiations (R, S with F, G respectively) overlap in the final state due to their potential to produce equivalent outcomes through different transformation pathways. This complexity precludes a unique identification of the interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
