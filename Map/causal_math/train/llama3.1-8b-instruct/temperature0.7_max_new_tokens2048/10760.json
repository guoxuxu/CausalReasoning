  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant related to eigenvalues. The solution space is transformed via the Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). The impact of computation methods such as numerical integration is also explored.\n\nGiven \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for some T > t_1 where both Fourier transformation and the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) were possibly applied, can we conclusively determine the specific interventions used (sequence and type of each), only by analyzing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) could be obtained from multiple possible sequences of applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\), because differential and integral transforms can have overlapping effects. Disentangling these effects from the final observation alone is generally impossible without additional information on the sequence and specifics of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
