  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf we modify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by multiplying with another exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant, how does it affect the outcome of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) changes the frequency of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\beta \\\\). This frequency shift directly impacts the behavior under the transformation, affecting the integral through the interaction between the frequencies and resulting in a different output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
