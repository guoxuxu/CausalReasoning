  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some final time T, can it be deduced solely based on this information which transformations (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) have been applied throughout its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{mt} \\\\) lead to a non-distinctive final state that could conceivably have resulted from various sequences and combinations of complex exponential transformations, therefore making it impossible to uniquely back-calculate the historical transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
