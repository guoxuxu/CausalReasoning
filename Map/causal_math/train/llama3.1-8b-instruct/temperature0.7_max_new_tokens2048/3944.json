  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix that represents the system's dynamics. Assume further that we can apply a transformation function \\\\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( D \\\\) another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the system's end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify which transformations were applied (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), both or neither) just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex dynamical evolution involving multiple transformations through matricial exponentials complicates backward tracing. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions with \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), and potentially could even be due to different parameters within those functions not distinguishable solely by the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
