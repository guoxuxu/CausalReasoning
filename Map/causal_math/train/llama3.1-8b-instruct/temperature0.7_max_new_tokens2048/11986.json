  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix and T is a specific time period.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an additional transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Dt}z\\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) still be predictable solely based on the initial conditions and matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another matrix transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) adds complexity by influencing the evolution alongside the impacts of A, B, and C. The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) thus depends on the interplay of all matrices (A, B, C, and D), not merely the initial matrices A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
