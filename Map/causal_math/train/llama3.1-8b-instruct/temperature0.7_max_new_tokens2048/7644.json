  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega pT} \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Various combinations of transformations and parameters (\\\\( n, m \\\\)) could lead to the same endpoint due to the form of the complex exponential function and its periodicity. The lack of unique decomposition in terms of exponents makes it impossible to uniquely identify the sequence or types of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
