  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system governed by the matrix equation \\\\(\\\\dot{X} = MX + K\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\) are constant matrices. To analyze the system's behavior, a function \\\\(h(X) = e^{NX}\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(N\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. The function \\\\(h\\\\) can potentially be applied at initial or intermediate time points.\n\nCan we derive the original matrix \\\\(X_0\\\\) by analyzing \\\\(X(T)\\\\) when knowing that \\\\(h(X)\\\\) was possibly applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Unless the effects of the matrix \\\\(N\\\\) on \\\\(X_0\\\\) are explicitly known and invertible, deducing \\\\(X_0\\\\) from \\\\(X(T)\\\\) is uncertain. The transformation \\\\(e^{NX_0}\\\\) complicates direct reversal to \\\\(X_0\\\\) without additional information about \\\\(N\\\\) and specific system trajectories.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
