  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), to the function u(t).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t = t_1 such that the function u is multiplied by a scalar constant \\\\( c \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the initial state at t_1 by scaling u, which alters how the solution evolves under L from t_1 to T. Therefore, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) depends on both the scalar constant \\\\( c \\\\) and the operator L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
