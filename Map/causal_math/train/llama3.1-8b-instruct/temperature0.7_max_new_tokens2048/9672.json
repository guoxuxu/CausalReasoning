  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, which follows the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied over a time period \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the final complex value \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the presence and type (\\\\( T(z) \\\\) versus \\\\( S(z) \\\\)) of any transformation applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of transformations and natural evolution, and without explicit knowledge of the applied transformations or their parameters (like integration limits), it is impossible to deduce the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
