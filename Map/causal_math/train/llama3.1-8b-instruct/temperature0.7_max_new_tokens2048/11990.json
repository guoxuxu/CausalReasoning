  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nIf a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before performing the Fourier transform, does the output in the frequency domain only depend on the original \\\\( ω \\\\), independent of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) convolves with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before the Fourier transform, resulting in a modification of the original signal's frequency domain representation. The output spectrum is a product of the Fourier transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), thus depending on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
