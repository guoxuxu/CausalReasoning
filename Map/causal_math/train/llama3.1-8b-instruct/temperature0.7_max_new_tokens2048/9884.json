  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We explore the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we precisely identify the type of intervention used (either Fourier, wavelet, or both) based solely on the observation of \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at the final time T?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform of \\\\(u\\\\) at time T might result from various combinations of interventions (Fourier, Wavelet, or their absence), and the overlaps in spectral effects induced by different transformations obscure the ability to distinguish between these interventions purely based on the transformed state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
