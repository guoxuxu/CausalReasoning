  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\dot{u} = Ku\\\\), with K being a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( j(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on K and not on L or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( j(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity by modifying the state with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\). Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on the interplay and integration of effects caused by L, M, and K because these transformations can have compounded and non-additive effects on both magnitude and phase of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
