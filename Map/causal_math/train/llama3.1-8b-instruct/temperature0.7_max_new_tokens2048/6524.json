  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nFrom observing the endpoint result of the integral after the mixed application of \\\\( a \\\\) and transformation \\\\( e^z \\\\), followed by intervention to \\\\( b \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we decipher accurately the points of modification and both parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral's result, influenced by changes at different segments and an exponential transformation, creates a complex output that does not allow back-calculation to determine precisely when and how interventions occurred nor the exact parameter values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) unambiguously.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
