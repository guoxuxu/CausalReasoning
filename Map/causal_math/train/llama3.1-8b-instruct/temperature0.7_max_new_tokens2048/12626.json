  "Problem": "Let us consider a complex function initially defined on the real axis: \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are real functions representing components in the complex plane. A transformation \\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\), where A is a complex constant and t is time, is applied.\n\nIf an intervention \\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\) is applied at some t = \\( t_1 \\) with B being a different complex constant, does the final outcome \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend on A, B, or both?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( g(z) \\) introduces additional modifications to the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) that depend on B. The resulting state \\( z(T) \\) is influenced by both transformations \\( e^{At} \\) and \\( e^{Bt} \\), as the application of the latter changes the evolution path initiated by the former.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
