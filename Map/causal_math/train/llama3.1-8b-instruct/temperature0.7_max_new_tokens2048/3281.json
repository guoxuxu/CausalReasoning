  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where a function \\( z(t) = e^{it}u \\) for complex \\( u \\) is undergoing transformation with \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\), where C is a complex number. The impact of an operation defined as \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) wherein D is a distinct complex constant is considered.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex value \\( u \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( u \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) \\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition by modifying \\( u \\) to \\( e^{D \\cdot 0}u = u \\), but the functional form changes how z evolves over time because \\( e^{Dt} \\) fundamentally alters the function's response depending on the relative effects of C and D, leading to a different trajectory and final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
