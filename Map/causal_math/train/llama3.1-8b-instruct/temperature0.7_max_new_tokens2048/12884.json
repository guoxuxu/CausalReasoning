  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) evolves naturally from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the output at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to the output obtained by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then evolving naturally to \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the function at the initial point. Applying it at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) squares the initial point, affecting the subsequent evolution because the complex exponential trajectory changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
