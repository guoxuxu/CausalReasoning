  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed solution at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) modifies the function by integrating it with a damping exponential factor, thereby altering the state dynamics from the very beginning. This change affects how the function evolves according to the differential equation, leading to a different state at any future time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
