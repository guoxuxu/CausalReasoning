  "Problem": "Consider a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t)\\\\) where A is a matrix governing the system dynamics. The impact of a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{Ct}x(t)\\\\), where C is also a matrix, on this system is examined. The ODE system is studied under typical operation and after application of a transformation.\n\nAssuming another transformation \\\\(G(x) = e^{Dt}x(t)\\\\), where D is another constant matrix, is applied at time t_1, will the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation by \\\\(G(x)\\\\) further complicates the evolution of the state from t_1 to T. The contributions of the matrices C and D through their respective transformations result in a final state that is influenced by all matrices (A, C, D), not just A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
