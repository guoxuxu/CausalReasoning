  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, there are multiple potential original states \\\\( z_0 \\\\) that could result in the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without explicit knowledge of B. The lack of information on B creates ambiguity in retracing \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
