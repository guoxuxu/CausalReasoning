  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nGiven only the trajectory \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at some time \\\\(T\\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the transformation used was \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation effects are multiplicative and do not necessarily disclose the sequence (i.e., \\\\(cd\\\\) is indistinguishable from \\\\(dc\\\\)), it is impossible to ascertain solely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both were applied, or in what order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
