  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we precisely identify the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) of the signal, without knowing the specifics of the time-domain form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of a purely exponential time-domain function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) distinctly shows a peak at its corresponding frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This characteristic allows the exact original frequency to be identified directly from the Fourier Transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
