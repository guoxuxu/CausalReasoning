  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) (squaring) is applied first and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) (exponential function) to a complex number z, will the outcome \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) at point z equal to directly applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on z without squaring?",
  "Explanation": "The squaring function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the input for the exponential function significantly. The function \\\\( e^{iz^2} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) represent vastly different transformations; squaring affects the rate and nature of oscillations in the complex exponential.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
