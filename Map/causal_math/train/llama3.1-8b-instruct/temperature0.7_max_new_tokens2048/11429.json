  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve without further interaction, will the spectrum of the signal be different at time t = T compared to the spectrum immediately after applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform at t = 0 captures the frequency components that remain consistent post-transformation. As \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a pure frequency component function, its spectral characteristics are invariant over time post transformation, given the nature of the Fourier transform in identifying frequency components irrespective of time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
