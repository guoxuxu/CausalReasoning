  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation function \\\\( U \\\\) defined as \\\\( Uz(t) = z(t) + Dz(t-1) \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as intervention, and considering the influence of \\\\( T \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U \\\\) introduces a dependency not only on the initial matrices A and B but also significantly on C and D due to the transformations. Each transformation potentially alters the trajectory in distinct ways that depend on their respective matrices, leading to differential final states at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
