  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the impact of altering this system using a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions (\\\\(h(x)\\\\), \\\\(k(x)\\\\), or both) were used based solely on the analysis of \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could be resultant from different combinations or sequences of the transformations \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and \\\\(k(x)\\\\) due to their possibly interchangeable or overlapping effects given the properties of matrix multiplication and exponentiation. The endpoint alone does not provide enough distinguishable information to decode the specific interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
