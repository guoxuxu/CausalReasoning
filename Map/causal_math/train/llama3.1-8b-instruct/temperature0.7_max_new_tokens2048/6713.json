  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant, at different points in time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then it evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to T = t under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) initially modifies the state to \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). Thus, the solution evolves as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}(Cz_0) \\\\), not simply \\\\( e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\). Unless \\\\( C \\\\) is a multiplicative identity, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) differs due to the scaling by \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
