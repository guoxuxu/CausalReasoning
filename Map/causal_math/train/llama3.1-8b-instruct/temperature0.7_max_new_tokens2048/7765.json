  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), transforming it into the frequency domain as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\hat{L} \\\\hat{u}\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) in the spatial domain and then applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that Fourier transforms linearize convolutions and derivatives under certain conditions, the evolution in the frequency domain via \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\hat{u} \\\\) should correspond equivalently to the direct spatial transformation followed by the Fourier transform, assuming L commutes over the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
