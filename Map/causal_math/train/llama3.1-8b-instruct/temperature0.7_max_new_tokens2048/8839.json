  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on the solution.\n\nAssuming an intervention using a new integral transformation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation and not on the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U[z] \\\\) applies yet another transformation with distinct properties, impacting both the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the eventual state at \\\\( T \\\\). The result at \\\\( T \\\\) therefore reflects the combined influences of the original differential equation, \\\\( T[z] \\\\), and \\\\( U[z] \\\\), creating a dependency beyond just the original equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
