  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nIf a new potential \\\\( U(x) \\\\) is abruptly introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), altering the dynamics to \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla (V(x) + U(x))\\\\), will the resulting endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on V and not on the characteristics of the Fourier transformation previously applied?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new potential U modifies the trajectories, but the characteristics of the previously applied Fourier transformation also heavily influences the system's state over time. The new potential and the original potential both play roles, but the initial transformation affects the overall trajectory subsequently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
