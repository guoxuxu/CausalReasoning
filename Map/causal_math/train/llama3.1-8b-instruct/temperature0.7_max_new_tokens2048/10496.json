  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nBased on the combined Fourier Transform result, can we precisely determine the form of the intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) if the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Although theoretical decomposition is possible if \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( F(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) add up linearly, distinguishing \\\\( F(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) can be challenging unless additional characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) are specified, such as its time of application, duration, or other distinctive features.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
