  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the function at time \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\) or both), strictly from knowing the function at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of multiple complex integrations and the non-commutative properties of matrix exponentials make it infeasible to pinpoint which transformation(s) were applied without additional information. The same end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations or applications of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
