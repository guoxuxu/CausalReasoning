  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its influence on a real function defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}F(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex variable. We analyze how transformations and interventions using a separate complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) affect the output of g(x).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) before calculating \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at any point x be the same as it would be under direct application of \\\\( F \\\\) without using \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the input to \\\\( F \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\). Given the singularities and specific behavior of \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), the integral computation and hence the resulting function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) will differ unless \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is trivially 1 or -1 (ignoring those, therefore, yields different outcomes).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
