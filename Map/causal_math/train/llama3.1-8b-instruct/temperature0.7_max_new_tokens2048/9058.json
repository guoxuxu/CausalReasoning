  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing D?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing D, the operation to derive \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is underdetermined because matrix D could be non-invertible, or there could be multiple solutions satisfying the equation for different D matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
