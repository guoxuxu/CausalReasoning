  "Problem": "Consider a functional relationship expressed as a complex integral transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} h(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a known time domain signal and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the impact of a Laplace transform on the signal's properties.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine that an additional term was added to \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While modifications in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) indicate changes in \\\\( h(t) \\\\), pinpointing exactly what the added term was (like \\\\( ke^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\)) from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone is not feasible without specific information about the original \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or additional constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
