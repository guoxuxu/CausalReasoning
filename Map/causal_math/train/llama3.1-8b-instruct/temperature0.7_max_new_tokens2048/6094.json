  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) under an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nFrom observing the output of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z] \\\\), can we uniquely identify the original function parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation variable \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific value of \\\\( s \\\\) used in the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) because different combinations of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) might yield similar outputs in certain conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
