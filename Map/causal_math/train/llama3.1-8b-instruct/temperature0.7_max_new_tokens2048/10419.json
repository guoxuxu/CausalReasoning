  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(s) ds \\\\), with the kernel transformation \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-st} \\\\). We explore the impact of a modifying function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the system over the variable t.\n\nIf we apply a new modifying function \\\\( h(t) = e^{t} \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the influence of the kernel \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) without being affected by either \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( h(t) = e^{t} \\\\) adds another layer of transformation to the system which, combined with the previous modification from \\\\( g(t) \\\\), alters the behavior and outcome of the integral transformation. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by all the modifiers rather than just the kernel alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
