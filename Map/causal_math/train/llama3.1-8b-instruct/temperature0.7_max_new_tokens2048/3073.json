  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamic system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant square matrix. The impact on the system's trajectory of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also constant matrices, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\\\). This transformation, due to the involvement of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and potentially nontrivial C, alters the trajectory in the phase space, resulting in a different state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
