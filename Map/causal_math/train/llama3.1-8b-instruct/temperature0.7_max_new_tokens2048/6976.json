  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving under the influence of a potential field governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\). The potential field is perturbed by an added magnetic field, described by a vector potential \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\). The effect of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) is represented through the transformation \\\\(f(\\\\vec{x}, t) = \\\\vec{A} \\\\times \\\\vec{x}\\\\) at time t.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint trajectory of the particle at t = T, can we determine precisely which vector potentials were introduced (whether \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\vec{B}\\\\), or both), only by knowing the trajectory at \\\\(t = T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nonlinear effects and dependencies on initial and intermediate conditions, multiple combinations of \\\\(\\\\vec{A}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\vec{B}\\\\) could result in the same final trajectory. The superposition and interaction of electromagnetic fields make it impossible to uniquely decipher the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
