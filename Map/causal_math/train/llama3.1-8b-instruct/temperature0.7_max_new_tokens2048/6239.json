  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix \\\\omega} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) on the solution.\n\nIf a modification \\\\(M(v) = Av\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on the initial Fourier transform or the matrix \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(M(v)\\\\) introduces an additional variable that alters how the solution evolves under the operator \\\\(L\\\\). The initial Fourier transform and the matrix \\\\(A\\\\) both influence the resulting endpoint, affecting its behavior in frequency space and complicating the dependency purely on \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
