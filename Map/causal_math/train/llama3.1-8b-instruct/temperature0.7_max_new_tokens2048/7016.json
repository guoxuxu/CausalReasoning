  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit represented by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the frequency complex variable, and circuit behavior is regulated by this impedance function. The circuit undergoes a Fourier transformation which impacts the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( R(T) \\\\), can one determine precisely what interventions were made (such as whether convolution with \\\\( K(t) \\\\), \\\\( K'(t) \\\\), or no convolution) by observing only the value of \\\\( R(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( R(T) \\\\) can result from different types of interventions or no intervention, due to the integral transformations and convolutions possibly leading to similar responses. Hence, without additional information about the type of intervention, the original actions cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
