  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex number. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) transforms the system at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another constant complex number) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the original transformation \\\\( P \\\\) and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another level of complexity to the system, affecting the ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Since both Q and R influence the dynamics through their own exponential transformations, the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on P, Q, and R.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
