  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, represented by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say \\\\( z(w) = e^{iBw}z(w) \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant matrix, is applied at some \\\\( w = w_1 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend only on the properties of \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation introduces a modification to the function \\\\( z(w) \\\\), effectively changing its behavior in the complex plane. This shift influences how \\\\( z(w) \\\\) contributes to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), making the resulting transform dependent on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). This could fundamentally alter the transformation's dependency and resulting characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
