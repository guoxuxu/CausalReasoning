  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a system of linear differential equations. Let \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be the voltage at a given node, represented by the linear relationship \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = MV + NU \\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(U(t)\\\\) represents external inputs like currents. Analyze the effects of applying an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, to the inputs.\n\nIf a different transformation, say a Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{U(t)\\\\} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( U(t) \\\\) as an intervention during the system operation, will the final state of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at a large t be unaffected by the type of transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The type of transformation applied to \\\\( U(t) \\\\) affects the characteristics of the input in the frequency domain, which in turn affects the system's response \\\\( V(t) \\\\). Different transforms like Laplace and Fourier provide different perspectives and modifications to the input signals, altering the system's eventual response behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
