  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\), identifying how this transformed state evolves over time.\n\nIf an additional transformation, \\\\(G(u)\\\\) (another integral transformation), is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the system's state at \\\\(t = T\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be solely determined by the original operator \\\\(L\\\\) despite the initial application of \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and intervention \\\\(G(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of both \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and \\\\(G(u)\\\\) significantly alters the initial and intermediate states of the system. The overall effect and final state at \\\\(T\\\\) depend on the combination of these transformations and the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\), thus not solely on \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
