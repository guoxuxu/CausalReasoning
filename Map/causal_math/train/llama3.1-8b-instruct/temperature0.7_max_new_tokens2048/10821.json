  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed for a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and then the function is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, does the Fourier transform remain unchanged for all future times?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation due to applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is a representation in the frequency domain. Since the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a steady-state solution of the differential equation, it remains unchanged by the dynamics of \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), hence the Fourier transform also remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
