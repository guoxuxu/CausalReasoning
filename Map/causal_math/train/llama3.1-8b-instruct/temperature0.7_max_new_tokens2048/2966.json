  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time t according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) be exclusively determined by observing the output of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involving integral and exponential components makes it practically impossible to reverse-engineer the original function without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) being applied, due to the cumulative and integrative effect over the entire history of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
