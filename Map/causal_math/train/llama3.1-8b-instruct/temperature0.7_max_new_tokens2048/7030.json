  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform of a function is known to be \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - w) \\\\), can we infer that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a single Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = w \\\\) in the Fourier transform indicates the original function was purely sinusoidal at the frequency \\\\( w \\\\), effectively characterizing it as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
