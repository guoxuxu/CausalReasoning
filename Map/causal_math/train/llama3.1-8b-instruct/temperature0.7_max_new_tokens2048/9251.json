  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant real number, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) the initial complex value. We are interested in studying the effect of applying the linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant real number.\n\nSuppose an intervention with a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant real number) is applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on \\\\(A\\\\) and not on \\\\(B\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory such that the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will be influenced by the effects of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\). The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) reflects compound interactions between these factors, particularly due to their exponential influence over the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
