  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. To study its behavior, we introduce an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) of the function.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) is introduced at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after starting with initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\), will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) solely reflect the dynamics under the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the system's fundamental frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), affecting the dynamics post-intervention. The Laplace transform of the system for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) will encapsulate the effects of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), thus not solely reflecting the original dynamics under \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
