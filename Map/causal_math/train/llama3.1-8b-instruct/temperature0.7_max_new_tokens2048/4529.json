  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger-like equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. An intervention is defined by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\), where B is another constant matrix different from A.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) is given and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without any intervention, will the trajectory remain unchanged after applying the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) changes the initial conditions and thus alters the trajectory from what it would be under the evolution \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) alone. The influence of B introduces an exponential modulation by \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) that affects both the magnitude and phase of z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
