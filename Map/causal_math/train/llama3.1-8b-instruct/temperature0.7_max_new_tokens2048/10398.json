  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the transformation matrix \\\\( L \\\\) and given an initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in a vector space. We evaluate the effect of an operator \\\\( T \\\\) which applies an integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\) affecting the system's evolution.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) after observing the evolution of the system at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely reconstruct the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) since the transformation could significantly alter trajectories in the vector space, influenced by the kernel \\\\( K(s, t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
