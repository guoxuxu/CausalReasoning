  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing trajectories in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is affected by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b\\\\overline{z} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing an intervention occurred at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely what the intervention was (whether it was \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both applied in some sequence)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various sequences or magnitudes of interventions with \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\). The non-trivial mixing of the operators through real and complex parts of the state makes it impossible to discern definitively what interventions were applied simply by analyzing the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
