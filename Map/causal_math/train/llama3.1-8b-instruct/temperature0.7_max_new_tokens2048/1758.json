  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform can uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) if it adheres to conditions like causality and stability, since \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) fully describes the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
