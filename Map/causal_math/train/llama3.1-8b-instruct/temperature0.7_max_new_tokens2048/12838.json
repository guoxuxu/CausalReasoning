  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled harmonic oscillators whose state is described by the vector function \\\\(\\\\vec{z}(t)\\\\). The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{\\\\vec{z}} = M\\\\vec{z}\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\vec{z})(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\vec{z}(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( G(\\\\vec{z}) = L\\\\vec{z} \\\\) (where L is a different constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 only depend on matrix M and not on the effects of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The earlier application of the Fourier transform and the subsequent intervention with matrix L both influence the evolution of state \\\\( \\\\vec{z}(T) \\\\). The earlier transformation can have lingering effects that interact with L, thus affecting the trajectory differently compared to an untransformed initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
