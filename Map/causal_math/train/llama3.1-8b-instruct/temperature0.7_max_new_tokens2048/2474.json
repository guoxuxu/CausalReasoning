  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the rate of growth of a population \\\\( p \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\), representing unrestricted quadratic growth. We consider alterations to this model through a transformation function \\\\( h(p) = p e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant decay factor.\n\nCan we deduce the original population size \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( p(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(p) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(p) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to accurately trace back and calculate the exact initial population size \\\\( p_0 \\\\). The presence of the decay factor \\\\( k \\\\) in the transformation can significantly alter initial conditions, making reverse calculation from \\\\( p(T) \\\\) to \\\\( p_0 \\\\) uncertain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
