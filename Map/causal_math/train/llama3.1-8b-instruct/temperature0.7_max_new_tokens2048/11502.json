  "Problem": "Consider a function represented by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We explore the effects of this function in the context of integral transformations on the complex plane, specifically using the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nCan the original function form \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be deduced by observing the transformed integral result of \\\\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\\\) if the specific transformation function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately reconstruct \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely from the integral result, because different transformations can lead to the same or similar integral results depending on their effects around the singularities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
