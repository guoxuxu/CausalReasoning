  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model for population growth under limited resources, described by the logistic differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dp}{dt} = rp(1 - \\\\frac{p}{K})\\\\), where \\\\(p\\\\) is the population, \\\\(r\\\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\\\(K\\\\) is the carrying capacity. We explore the impact of a harvesting rate represented by a function \\\\(h(p) = Hp\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant, that could be applied to the population over time.\n\nIf we apply the harvesting function \\\\(h(p) = Hp\\\\) to the initial population \\\\(p_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then allow the population to grow under the logistic equation without further harvesting, will the population \\\\(p(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if no harvesting had been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the harvesting function initially decreases the population which then grows according to the logistic model. This initial reduction changes the trajectory of growth as it impacts the logistic growth formula's rate of change, leading to a different population size at any future time T compared to an unhindered growth from \\\\(p_0\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
