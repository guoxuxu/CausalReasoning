  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We are examining how the Laplace transform, which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} \\\\) with complex s, affects our causal understanding of this system.\n\nIf we begin with the system at the initial state defined by \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), and observe it evolve up till time T without any transformation applied, will the real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) equal to \\\\( \\\\cos(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the system evolves according to the natural progression \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{it} = \\\\cos(t) + i \\\\sin(t) \\\\), the real part of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) indeed equals \\\\( \\\\cos(T) \\\\), following the identity of Euler's formula.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
