  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves without further changes, does the transformation affect the nature of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) computes the integral of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from 0 to T, which is independent of the function's ongoing form. The nature of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), which is purely based on the exponential function at a specific time T, remains unaffected by the previous integral evaluation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
