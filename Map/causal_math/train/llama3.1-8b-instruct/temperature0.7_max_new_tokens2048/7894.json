  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iCs}z(s) ds \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at t = T represents an aggregate effect not just dependent on \\\\( z(0) \\\\) but also on all values \\\\( z(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in \\\\( [0, T] \\\\). Multiple initial conditions \\\\( z(0) \\\\) can lead to different paths that might produce similar results in \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), without clear traceability to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) specifically.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
