  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bx^2 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy - Dy^2 \\\\) where A, B, C, D are constants. We explore the effects of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\), where E is a constant, applied at various points in time t.\n\nIf during the evolution a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant) is applied as an intervention at some time t_1 > 0, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the differential equations and not on E or F?",
  "Explanation": "Because both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modify the trajectory through exponential functions of time, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by E and F as well as the constants A, B, C, D in the differential equations. The transformations change magnitude and rotation in the complex plane, affecting the ultimate position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
