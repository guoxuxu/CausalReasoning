  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t, z) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. We study the impact of an intervention defined by the transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = t^k z \\\\) where k is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations or interventions (whether applying t^k, t^h, or both) were used, only by knowing the output \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a specific s?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation could yield the same result from different powers of t (i.e., k and h) due to the overlapping effects in exponential decay and power scaling of t. The myriad of potential combinations and similar outcomes makes it impossible to uniquely identify specific transformations or interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
