  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nIf a transformation F(f(z)*e^z) is directly applied where F is the Fourier Transform and subsequently an intervention in form of another function g(z) is multiplied to the result, will the end state still exhibit the original traits of f(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform combined with multiplication by e^z and further multiplication by g(z) fundamentally changes the function's structural and analytical characteristics. The multiple transformations make it exceedingly difficult to preserve or clearly represent original traits of f(z) in the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
