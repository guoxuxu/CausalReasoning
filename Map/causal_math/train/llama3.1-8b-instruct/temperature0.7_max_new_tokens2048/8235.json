  "Problem": "Consider a complex system whose evolution is governed by a non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = N(z)\\\\), where \\\\(N(z)\\\\) denotes a non-linear operator involving complex functions. We study the effect of a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which translates the function from the time domain to the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( j(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{z(s)\\\\}(t) \\\\) (inverse Laplace as an intervention) is applied, will the outcome \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the operator \\\\( N(z) \\\\) and disregard previous transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) adds another transformative layer, bringing the function back from the complex frequency domain to the time domain, however, potentially modified. This intervention alters the function such that both N and the historical transformations (Laplace and its inverse) will affect the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
