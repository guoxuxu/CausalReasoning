  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Investigate how the Fourier transform affects this system, particularly through a transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is the variable of transformation.\n\nObserving the output of the Fourier transform as a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\\\), can we unequivocally infer the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) without knowing the initial function form?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\\\) in the Fourier transform uniquely suggests that the original function was a pure exponential of the form \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), as this is the only function that results in such a transform under standard conditions without additional transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
