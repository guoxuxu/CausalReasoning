  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) is calculated for \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) without any modifications to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), will the transformed function have a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) directly results in a delta function centered at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). This is due to the property of the Fourier Transform which maps purely oscillatory components to precise frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
