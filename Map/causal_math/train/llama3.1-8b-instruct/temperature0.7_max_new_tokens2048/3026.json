  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nKnowing the function state at time T, and assuming no transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, can we unequivocally reconstruct the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "In this case, the path is uniquely determined by the natural evolution of the function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), and with knowledge that no transformation was applied, reconstructing the path from initial state to T is straightforward as it follows the known exponential behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
