  "Problem": "Assume a system of partial differential equations governing heat flow in a rod, described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where u is the temperature and k is the diffusion constant. Explore the consequences of applying a temperature-dependent transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda u} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), solely based on knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature profile at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of the transformations \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\) due to their exponential effects and the nature of heat diffusion. The overlap in potential effects from different transformations makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact interventions used solely based on the endpoint data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
