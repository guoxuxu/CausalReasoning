  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T(v) = \\\\int e^{-sx} v(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by a different integral transform \\\\( U(w) = \\\\int e^{-kx} w(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the behavior of the transformed function at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be independent of the original transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a different transform as an intervention affects the overall behavior and outcome. Since the transforms might not commute and because they act on potentially different aspects or scales of the function, the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on both the original and the intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
