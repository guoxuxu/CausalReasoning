  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a complex constant. Investigate the influence of the transformation defined by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) could have modified the initial conditions in a way that isn’t clearly reversible, especially if B and A have different effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
