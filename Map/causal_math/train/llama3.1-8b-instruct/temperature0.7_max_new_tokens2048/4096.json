  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) after an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (Fourier transform, application of \\\\( M \\\\), or both) were used only by observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of the original Fourier transform and the application of operator \\\\( M \\\\), with potentially equivalent outcomes. Deciphering the exact sequence or presence of these transformations from the end state alone is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
