  "Problem": "We postulate a scenario involving the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t) \\) and its effect when used in conjunction with an integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, applied to a function \\( h(t) \\) that represents a physical system's response.\n\nHaving observed the Laplace Transform of a potentially intervened function, can one determine the nature of the intervention (whether convolution with \\( \\delta(t) \\), \\( g(t) \\), or both) solely based on the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of a convolution manifests as the product of the transforms of the individual functions involved in the convolution. Without additional information about the specific forms of \\( \\delta(t) \\) or \\( g(t) \\) or both, distinguishing between these potential interventions based solely on the transform output is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Observed Laplace Transform → Intervention Type; \n  Intervention Type → Convolution with \\( \\delta(t) \\) or \\( g(t) \\); \n  Convolution with \\( \\delta(t) \\) → Shift in Laplace Transform; \n  Convolution with \\( g(t) \\) → Alteration of Laplace Transform; \n  Alteration of Laplace Transform → Difficulty in Determining Intervention Type"
