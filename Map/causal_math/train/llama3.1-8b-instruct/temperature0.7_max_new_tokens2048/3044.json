  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nGiven information about \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain which transformations were applied (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) by analyzing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from numerous combinations of transformations due to the different phase shifts they introduce. Since these phase shifts can overlap and create the same final appearance in the complex plane, identifying the specific sequence or types of interventions solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
