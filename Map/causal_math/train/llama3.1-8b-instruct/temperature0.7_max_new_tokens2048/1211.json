  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention function \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( P(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) after \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is computed, will the resultant inverse Fourier Transform still purely depend on \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifies \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) already impacted by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\), thus the result, when taken inverse Fourier Transform, will depend on both \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) and not just on \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
