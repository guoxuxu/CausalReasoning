  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which maps a function in the time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain. Investigate the effect of modifying this transformation by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where a is a real number.\n\nCan the sequence of operations (whether \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), or both) be specifically identified just by observing the combined transformation's outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome, being a product of potential multiple transformations, does not uniquely indicate which transformations were applied or in what order due to the overlapping effects in shifting the function in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → F(s); s → F(s); e^(-as) → F(s); e^(-bs) → F(s); f(t) → L[f(t)] = F(s); f(t) → e^(-as) → L[f(t)] = F(s)e^(-a); f(t) → e^(-bs) → L[f(t)] = F(s)e^(-b); f(t) → e^(-as) → e^(-bs) → L[f(t)] = F(s)e^(-(a+b));"
