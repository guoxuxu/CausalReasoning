  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the Fourier transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after applying an intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\), is it possible to discern whether only \\\\( f(z) \\\\), only \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both transformations were applied by analyzing the output?",
  "Explanation": "The modifications imposed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) overlap in the frequency domain, mixing the components in a way that makes it ambiguous and complex to distinguish between the effects of one or both operations solely from the Fourier transform output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
