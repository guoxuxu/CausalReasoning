  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves in time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We scrutinize the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant, and observe the causal relationships and system dynamics.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to a function \\\\( z_0 \\\\), then allows to evolve under the operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further modifications, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for a time t = T differ from the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\( z_0 e^{b \\\\cdot 0} = z_0 \\\\) but affects how it evolves subsequently due to exponential growth factor \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\). This leads to a trajectory of the form \\\\( e^{(a+b)t}z_0 \\\\) differing from \\\\( e^{at}z_0 \\\\) due to additional complex exponential growth controlled by \\\\( b \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
