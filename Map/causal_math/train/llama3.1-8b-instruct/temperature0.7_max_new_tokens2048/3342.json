  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor. We need to also consider an intervention by adjusting the temperature profile over time with a function \\\\( f(t) = T_0 + kt \\\\), where \\\\( T_0 \\\\) is the initial temperature and \\\\( k \\\\) is the rate of change of temperature.\n\nCan the parameters \\\\( T_0 \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) be uniquely determined from observing the behavior of \\\\( R(T) \\\\) at different times without prior knowledge about \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in \\\\( R(T) \\\\) correlate with temperature changes, multiple combinations of \\\\( T_0 \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could yield similar patterns in \\\\( R(T) \\\\). Without additional information about the temperature function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), these parameters cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
