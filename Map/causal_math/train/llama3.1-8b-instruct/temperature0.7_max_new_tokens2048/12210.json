  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at t = t_1 a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the transformations A and B but not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) imports another level of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on C and D in addition to A and B. The influence of both C and D through the transformations affects the trajectory and the eventual state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
