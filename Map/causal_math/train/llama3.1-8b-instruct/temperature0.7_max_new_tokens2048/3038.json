  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent real parts dependent on a parameter \\\\( t \\\\). The function is subjected to transformation through the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), with \\\\( s \\\\) being a complex number.\n\nKnowing the Laplace Transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) at some complex s, can one uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its transform without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that the Laplace Transform covers all necessary conditions for invertibility, the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined from its Laplace Transform. This is due to the one-to-one nature of the Laplace Transform under appropriate conditions on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
