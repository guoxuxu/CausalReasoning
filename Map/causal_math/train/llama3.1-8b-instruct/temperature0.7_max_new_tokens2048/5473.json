  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nIf a low-pass filter is applied to the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to eliminate high-frequency components, and then the inverse Fourier transform is used without further intervention, will the resulting time-domain signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be identical to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a low-pass filter alters the frequency spectrum of the signal by removing high-frequency components. This change in the Fourier spectrum modifies the time-domain representation of the signal, leading to a different \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) that may have reduced details or smoothness compared to the original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Low-pass filtering → Reduced high-frequency components in Fourier transform; Reduced high-frequency components in Fourier transform → Inverse Fourier transform; Inverse Fourier transform → z'(t); Low-pass filtering → z'(t)"
