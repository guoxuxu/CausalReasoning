  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) in a rod over time t obeys the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. Assume further that a transformation \\\\(g(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u(x,t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant, is applied to study the temperature decay due to radiative loss.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we infer the original distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to conclusively backtrack to \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) as the exponential factor introduced by \\\\(g(u)\\\\) could have significantly altered the initial conditions, and these changes depend sensitively on the parameter \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
