  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t, satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's behavior using the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( z(t_1) = dz(t_1) \\\\) is applied, where d is a constant, will the subsequent behavior of the system in terms of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s depend solely on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) which affects the overall solution of the differential equations. The new initial condition post-intervention directly influences the resulting transform, making \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) dependent not just on A and B, but also on the nature and timing of the intervention d.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
