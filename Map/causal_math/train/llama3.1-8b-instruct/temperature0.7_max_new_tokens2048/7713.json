  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing the output of a system where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(t-\\\\tau)A}Bu(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal with B a constant matrix and A a linear operator. Analyze the impact of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) to the signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an unaltered input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is used in the system from t = 0 to T, and the Laplace transform is not applied, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remain the same as under normal circumstances without alteration?",
  "Explanation": "Without any transformation or alteration to the input signal, the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will naturally follow its conventional path determined by the system's response to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) using the integral formula. Thus, the outcome remains unmodified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
