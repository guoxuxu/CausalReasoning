  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) where \\( f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), and \\( x, y \\) are real variables. Here, we further explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\( T[f](\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(x, y) e^{-i\\omega x} dx \\) on this system.\n\nIf \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) is computed initially for some \\(\\omega\\), then no further transformations are applied, and only the underlying function \\( f \\) evolves by adjusting \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), will \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) at a later time reflect the changes in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) linearly through \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T[f](\\omega) \\) captures the frequency component of \\( f \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and not \\( y \\). Any changes in \\( y \\) will lead to a change in the imaginary part of \\( f \\), especially since \\( y^2 \\) will contribute a biasing term, but will not linearly influence the outcome of \\( T[f](\\omega) \\), which is primarily sensitive to changes in \\( x \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
