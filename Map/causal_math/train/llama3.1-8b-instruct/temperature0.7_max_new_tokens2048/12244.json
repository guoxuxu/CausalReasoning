  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving in time under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) are real constants reflecting oscillatory and exponential behaviors, respectively.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)0}z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any future time t be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation at time t = 0 is essentially \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), hence the initial condition remains unchanged. The subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) adheres strictly to the transformation rule, leading to the same outcome as if the initial state had been directly evolved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
