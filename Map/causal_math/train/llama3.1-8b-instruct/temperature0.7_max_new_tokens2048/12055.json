  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + Au_x = 0\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the operator \\\\(T(u) = e^{-Bx}u\\\\) across the spatial domain x, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(T(u)\\\\), \\\\(S(u)\\\\), or both), solely by knowing the state at \\\\(x,T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations due to the properties of exponential functions affecting linear superposition. The interactions of transformations \\\\(T(u)\\\\) and \\\\(S(u)\\\\) within the differential equation make it complex to unambiguously determine what interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
