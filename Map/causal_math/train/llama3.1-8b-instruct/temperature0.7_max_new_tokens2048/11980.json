  "Problem": "Analyze the effect on signal transduction in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution operation with an impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This study involves examining the introduction of a Fourier transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) transformed by a function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and its implications on the system's output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes Fourier transformation by \\\\( F(w) \\\\) to modify its spectrum before being processed by the LTI system, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the same as if no spectral modification had occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(w) \\\\) alters the frequency components of the input signal. Since the system's output is the convolution of the impulse response with the input, altering the spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes the outcome as manifested in \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
