  "Problem": "Let's examine a continuity equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (vu) = 0\\\\), where v is a fixed velocity field. Consider the Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)(k)=\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ikx}u(x) dx\\\\) applied to the function u. We explore how this transformation affects the evolution of u over time.\n\nIf we apply the Fourier transformation to a function u at t = 0 and allow it to evolve according to the continuity equation without further action, will the function u(t) at t = T correspond to the direct evolution of the initial Fourier transform at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transformation converts the differential operation into an algebraic operation, the evolution under the continuity equation transforms into a multiplication by a phase factor, preserving the behavior across the transformed domain. Thus, applying the Fourier transform at the beginning does not change the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
