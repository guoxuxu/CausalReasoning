  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega \\tau}z(\\tau)d\\tau\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\(T(z)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), is it possible to accurately identify the point \\\\(t_1\\\\) and the exact nature of frequency change \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) applied during the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation masks specific information about the time and nature of interruptions in the original function due to its continuous and accumulative nature, blending the effects of any changes over the interval. Thus, one cannot isolate and identify the exact details of the intervention, such as the time \\\\(t_1\\\\) or the magnitude of frequency change \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), based solely on the end result at \\\\(t = T\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
