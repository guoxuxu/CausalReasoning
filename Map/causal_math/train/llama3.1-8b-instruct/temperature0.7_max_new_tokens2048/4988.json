  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Cz \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a constant complex matrix. Analyze the consequences of applying a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dz}z \\\\) over complex variable z, with D being another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final state of \\\\( z \\\\) after various transformations and evolutions, can we conclusively identify the precise transformations used (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the outcome \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the final outcome is generally not possible due to the potential overlap in effects caused by non-commuting matrix exponentials. Multiple transformation paths could lead to the same endpoint, making it difficult to discern which interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
