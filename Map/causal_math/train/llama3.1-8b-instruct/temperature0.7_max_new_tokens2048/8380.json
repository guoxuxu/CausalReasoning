  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nGiven the final output, can we determine if the input was first delayed and then amplified, or first amplified then delayed, by only knowing the structure of the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about the original signal or the order of operations, it's impossible to distinguish based on the output alone whether the input was first delayed then amplified, or first amplified then delayed. The final output expression in either case would be identical due to the commutative property of linear operations in this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
