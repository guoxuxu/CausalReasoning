  "Problem": "We examine a fluid dynamics setting where the flow velocity vector field \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\\\\) is influenced by the Navier-Stokes equation under an applied external force \\\\(\\\\vec{f}(x, y, z, t)\\\\). Consider the complex transformation of the force field, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{f}(x, y, z, t))(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform in the x-direction.\n\nCan one accurately determine whether the original force field or its transformed counterpart was applied by analyzing the flow velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(x, y, z, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific type of force intervention from the final velocity is highly challenging due to the complex dynamics involved in the fluid system and the potential alterations induced by both the original and transformed force fields. The non-uniqueness of solutions in such a dynamically rich environment as governed by the Navier-Stokes equation prevents definitive causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
