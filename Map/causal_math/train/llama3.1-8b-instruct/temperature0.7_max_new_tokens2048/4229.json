  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of a transformation given by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform with respect to time t) is studied.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) without further transformation, will the transformed state \\\\( F(u)(x, s) \\\\) at s be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was transformed after evolving to a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) immediately changes the representation of the system from a time-domain solution to a complex s-domain expression. The evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) may not commute with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), meaning that the order of transformation and evolution matters, hence the state \\\\( F(u)(x, s) \\\\) varies depending on when the Laplace transform is applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
