  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) represents the influence of noise, which could be stochastic in nature. We explore the effect of introducing a control operation given by \\\\(g(z) = Dz\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf the system starts from an initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) and evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\) over a time period T without any intervention, will the system's state at time T be identically distributed as if \\\\(D\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the diagonal matrix \\\\(D\\\\) at t = 0 would affect the initial state, leading to different system dynamics due to the interaction between \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\). Also, the inherent stochasticity from \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) can result in diverging paths even from modified initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
