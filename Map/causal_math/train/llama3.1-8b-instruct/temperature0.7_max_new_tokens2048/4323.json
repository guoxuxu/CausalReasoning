  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being different constant matrices. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention involving a new transformation \\\\( U[z] = e^{Dt}z(t) \\\\) (with D a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( U[z] \\\\) brings into the dynamics an additional matrix exponential effect involving D. Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the combination and interaction effects of A, B, C (from the prior transformation), and D introduced via the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
