  "Problem": "Imagine a complex dynamic pattern governed by the linear differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The behavior is significantly altered by an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt} x(t') dt' \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and t spans from 0 to a finite time T.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( U(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where N is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 solely depend on L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an intervention such as \\\\( U(x) \\\\) modifies the state trajectory by superimposing the effect of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will therefore be influenced by N, as well as L and potentially M from the prior transformation, altering the expected outcome from just the L dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
