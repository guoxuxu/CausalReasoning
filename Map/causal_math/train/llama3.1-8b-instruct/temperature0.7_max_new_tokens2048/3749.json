  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. The transformation of this function under a Laplace transform is investigated.\n\nDoes the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{At}\\\\} \\\\) solely depend on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) results in \\\\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\\\), where I is the identity matrix and s is the complex variable in the Laplace transform. This transformation is directly determined by the matrix A with no other factors influencing the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → e^At; A → Laplace transform; e^At → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → depends on A"
