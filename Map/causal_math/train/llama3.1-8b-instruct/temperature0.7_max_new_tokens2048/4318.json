  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), widely known as the Laplace transform, applied to the function over time.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we pinpoint the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) embedded within the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without other information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), and the singularity point directly indicates the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Thus, observing the form and poles of the Laplace transform allows precise identification of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
