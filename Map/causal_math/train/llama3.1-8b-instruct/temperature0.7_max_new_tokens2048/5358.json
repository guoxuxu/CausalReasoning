  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input that can be transformed using an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{F(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of a new input function. We study how transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affect the system's behavior.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at a time T, can we determine whether the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or the transformed \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) was used, without any interventions or prior knowledge about the input's nature?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original control input strictly from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is generally impossible without additional data, due to potential non-uniqueness in producing the same state with different input functions, given that different inputs could potentially result in the same final state depending on the systems’s observability properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
