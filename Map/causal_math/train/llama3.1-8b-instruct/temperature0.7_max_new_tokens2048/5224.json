  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a function \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a transformation through a Laplace Transform, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = X(s) \\). Afterward, an inverse operation is applied via \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} \\) over numeric domain s, using a different parameter set \\( p \\).\n\nConsidering there is a difference observed in the final \\( x(t) \\), can we deduce the precise parameter alteration \\( p \\) in \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\) based solely on the modified \\( x(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple parameter sets \\( p \\) could create the same changes in \\( x(t) \\) after the inverse operation due to the complex nature and variability of transformations in the s-domain. Therefore, the exact alteration cannot be uniquely determined from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "parameter set p → Laplace Transform → X(s); X(s) → inverse operation → x(t); x(t) → difference observed; difference observed → parameter alteration p"
