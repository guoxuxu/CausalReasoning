  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(k) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) given by the integral transformation \\\\( F(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} f(x) dx \\\\). We aim to evaluate how the application of a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\), defined as \\\\( Df(x) = f'(x) \\\\), influences the Fourier transformed function.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(k) \\\\) after computing the Fourier transform of \\\\( Df(x) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the effect of the derivative in the Fourier space is discernible as multiplication by \\\\( -ik \\\\), the precise recovery of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( -ik F(k) \\\\) alone is not guaranteed without knowing initial or boundary conditions due to potential loss of information (e.g., constants in integration).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
