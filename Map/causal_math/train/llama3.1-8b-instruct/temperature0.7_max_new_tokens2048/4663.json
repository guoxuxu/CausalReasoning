  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the differential systems (A for \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and B for \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional accumulated effects from the integral of \\\\( z \\\\) up to time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This not only alters the trajectory post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\) but also intertwines the effects of the earlier complex function evolution influenced by A, B, and C. The outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus relies on A, B, C, and the transformation applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
