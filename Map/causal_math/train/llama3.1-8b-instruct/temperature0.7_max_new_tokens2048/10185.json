  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a control system operates following a linear equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), with K being a constant coefficient matrix and u representing external control influences. Suppose an experimental transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) is introduced, where A is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\) without further transformation, will the system's state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at any later time t correlate exclusively with the initial matrix K?",
  "Explanation": "Initial application of \\\\( f(y) \\\\) or \\\\( e^{At}y_0 \\\\) modifies the system's initial state. The subsequent evolution of the state under \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\) will then be directly influenced by both the altered initial conditions caused by A and the dynamics dictated by K. Therefore, the state at any later time is influenced by A in addition to K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
