  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-commutative nature of the complex exponential function in transformations, different combinations of A and B can potentially result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, it is impossible to uniquely determine the specific transformations used only from the final state, as different parameters or timings of the applications could yield the same outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
