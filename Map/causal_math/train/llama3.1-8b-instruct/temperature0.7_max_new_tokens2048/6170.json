  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. We will examine the effects of performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) obtained at any complex s, can we infer precisely whether the initial condition was transformed as \\\\( z(0) = e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\) or just started as \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional constraints or knowledge about the phase \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), the transformation by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) at \\\\( z(0) \\\\) leaves the modulus of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) invariant although it may affect the phase. Extracting the phase modification induced only by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is generally not determinable solely from the transform values.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
