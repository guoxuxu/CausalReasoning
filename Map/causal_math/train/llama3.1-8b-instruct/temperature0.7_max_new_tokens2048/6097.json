  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the Laplace equation in a rectangular domain, governed by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\). We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions of the domain. Let the boundary conditions change from function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(h(x, y) = g(x, y) + e^{kx}\\\\), where `k` is a constant.\n\nIf the boundary conditions are initially described by \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) without further changes, will the solution inside the domain strictly follow the original Laplace equation solution derived from \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the boundary condition to \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) without intervention modifies the boundary values used in the solution computation. The presence of \\\\(e^{kx}\\\\) adds an additional component to the domain's boundary, which alters the interior potential according to the superposition principle in the Laplace equation, yielding a different solution than that from the original boundary condition \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
