  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{αt}z \\\\) where \\\\( α \\\\) is a complex constant, applied at different points in the time evolution.\n\nIs it possible to determine the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the transformation could have altered both the magnitude and phase of the initial state, dependent on the real and imaginary components of \\\\( α \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
