  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving via the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\), with Q being a complex constant. Analysis includes the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\), where P is also a complex constant, representing an operational transformation.\n\nCan we precisely determine what interventions (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used from just the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), knowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlap in potential effects from each exponential transformation (each able to adjust phases and magnitudes), and without explicit time-stamped records of interventions, it’s not possible to uniquely deduce which transformations were applied to reach \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
