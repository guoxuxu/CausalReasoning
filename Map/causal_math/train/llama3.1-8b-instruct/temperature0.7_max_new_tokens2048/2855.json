  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral in the complex plane. We will evaluate the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt}dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed path and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number parameter. The analysis is affected by transformations using the function \\\\( f(z) = z^{2} + a \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), the contour is modified using another function \\\\( g(z) = z + b \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a real constant) as an intervention, will the value of \\\\( I \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) depend only on the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention further modifies the shape or position of the contour, which affects the integral evaluation. These combined transformations mean that the final integral value depends on both the effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
