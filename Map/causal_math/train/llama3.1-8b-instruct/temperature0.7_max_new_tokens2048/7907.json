  "Problem": "Using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in a dynamical system, analyze its evolution under a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - az \\\\) with a real constant a. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t) is considered.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\), a Laplace transform \\\\( Lp(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) (where s is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) mainly depend on the operator \\\\( L \\\\), and not significantly on the effects of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) or \\\\( Lp(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform as an intervention alters the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by transforming it in a manner different from\\\\( F(z) \\\\), affecting all subsequent evolution under \\\\( Lz \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes a function of the applied Laplace and Fourier transforms along with the operator L, making it dependent on all factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
