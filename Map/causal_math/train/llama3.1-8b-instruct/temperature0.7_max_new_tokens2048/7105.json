  "Problem": "Examine the effects of a complex function transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\(t\\\\) is time. This scenario includes the subsequent application of Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on a complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) at t = 0 affect the stability of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(z(t))\\\\}\\\\) compared to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is not a function of time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) modifies the input to the complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\), thus potentially altering the convergence properties and stability of the Laplace transform of the function. The oscillatory nature of \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) influences the behavior of \\\\(f(z(t))\\\\) differently at different times, affecting the conditions under which the Laplace transform is valid.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
