  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We also consider a Laplace transformation, where \\\\(L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt\\\\) is applied.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transformation to \\\\(z_0\\\\) initially and then let it evolve via \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\(L(z)(s)\\\\) at a future point be identical to transforming the state after it has evolved to that point under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation alters the function in a way that affects its subsequent evolution under the differential equation. The Laplace transformation integrates over an exponential weighted complete history of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), changing how the function would evolve compared to untransformed \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
