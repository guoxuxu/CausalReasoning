  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves by the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), with k being a complex constant. This problem examines how transformations and system dynamics interact over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T remain purely dependent on the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), unaffected by \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) from this modified initial condition results in \\\\( z(T) = e^{kT}e^{i\\\\theta}z_0 \\\\), which differs by a complex phase factor e^{i\\\\theta} from the direct evolution \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends significantly on the initial transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
