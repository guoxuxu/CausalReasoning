  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the position of a particle, \\(s(t)\\), is influenced by a complex potential \\(U(z) = V(x) + iW(y)\\), where \\(z = x + iy\\). The movement is governed by the equation \\(\\dot{z}(t) = U'(z)\\). We assess the impact of linear transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) defined by the matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}\\), and their effect over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf at some time \\(t_1\\), another transformation, call it \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\), defined by the matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{bmatrix}\\), is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depend only on the derivative \\(U'\\) and not on \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) or \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) introduces another variable affecting the trajectory. Thus, the final position \\(z(T)\\) depends not only on \\(U'\\) but also significantly on the effects and interaction of both \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Q}\\) with the evolving system state, impacting how \\(\\dot{z}\\) drives the motion from the modified state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
