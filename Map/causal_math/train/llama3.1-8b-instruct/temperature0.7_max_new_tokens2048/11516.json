  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are fixed matrices. Analyze how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) as another constant matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when applied at different stages.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the interventions used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) based only on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is problematic due to the non-commutative properties of the matrix exponentials and potential overlapping effects. Different combinations of initial conditions and interventions could yield the same endpoint, making exact determination challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
