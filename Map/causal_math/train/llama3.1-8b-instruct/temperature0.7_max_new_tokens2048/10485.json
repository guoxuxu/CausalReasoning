  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a time-varying admittance matrix \\\\( Y(t) \\\\), and a network described by the voltage-current relationship \\\\( I = Y(t)V \\\\). We examine the impact of a transformation represented by the matrix function \\\\( P(t) = e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, that affects the voltage vector over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) is applied to the voltage vector \\\\( V_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves to time T under the rule \\\\( I = Y(t)V \\\\) without further intervention, will the current vector \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( V_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the rule without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) to the voltage vector alters its initial state significantly, changing the resulting effective voltage applied to the circuit. As Y(t) multiplies a different initial \\( V(T) \\), calculated from \\\\( P(T)V_0 \\\\), the resulting current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) will differ unless Q and Y(t) exhibit specific commutative properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
