  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear operator transformation on a Fourier series representation of a function. Let \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} a_n e^{inx} \\\\), and the transformation is defined by \\\\( T(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\), where \\\\( b_n \\\\) are coefficients modifying the Fourier coefficients \\\\( a_n \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( T'(g(x)) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} c_n b_n a_n e^{inx} \\\\) (where \\\\( c_n \\\\) are new coefficients) is applied as an intervention, will the final spectral properties at \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial coefficients \\\\( b_n \\\\) and not on \\\\( c_n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation with new coefficients \\\\( c_n \\\\) further modifies the Fourier coefficients, thus making the final state at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) dependent on both the initial transformation by \\\\( b_n \\\\) and the subsequent transformation by \\\\( c_n \\\\). The changes induced by \\\\( c_n \\\\) cannot be ignored in determining the final spectral properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
