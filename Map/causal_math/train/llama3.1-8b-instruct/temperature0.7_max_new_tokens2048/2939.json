  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\), such as a convolution with a Gaussian kernel, is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial PDE and not on the actions of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform will reflect both the effects of the initial evolution due to the PDE and the convolution intervention. As \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\) can significantly alter the energy distribution across the Fourier modes, its effect cannot be isolated from that resulting from the initial PDE.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
