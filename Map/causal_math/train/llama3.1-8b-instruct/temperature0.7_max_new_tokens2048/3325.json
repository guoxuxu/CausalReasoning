  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real number and represents angular frequency. The function is initially subjected to the linear operator \\\\( L \\{ z(t) \\} = \\\\int_{0}^{∞} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which represents the Laplace transform.\n\nDoes the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t=0 without any modification result in an expression dependent solely on the parameter \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is formally calculated as \\\\( L \\{ e^{iωt} \\} = \\\\int_{0}^{∞} e^{-st}e^{iωt} \\\\, dt = \\\\int_{0}^{∞} e^{(iω-s)t} \\\\, dt \\\\. Assuming convergence, this is solely dependent on \\\\( ω \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\), indicating the effect is strictly a function of the cause parameter \\\\( ω \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
