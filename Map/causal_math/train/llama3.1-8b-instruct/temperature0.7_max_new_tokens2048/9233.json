  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(t_0, x) \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) and then applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of the Fourier transform with linear differential operators, the transformation commutes with the evolution operator. The Fourier transform of the evolved function is the same as the evolution of the Fourier transform of the initial function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
