  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine changes when applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, modifying the amplitude and phase.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = mz \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied, will the output at time T > t_1 be influenced only by the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not by the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Each transformation, beginning with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and followed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), sequentially modifies the system’s trajectory. Finally, the output will reflect multiplicative effects of \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( m \\\\), and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), seen as \\\\( km e^{i \\omega T} \\\\) and thus does not depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
