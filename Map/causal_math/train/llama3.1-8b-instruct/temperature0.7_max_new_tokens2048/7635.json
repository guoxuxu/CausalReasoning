  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) initially and after an intervention defined by multiplying by a modifier function \\\\(m(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention function \\\\( m(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying the transform as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\cdot m(\\\\omega)\\\\), will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 still accurately reflect dynamics governed solely by L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the frequency components of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\) in a manner that might not align with the natural propagation under L. This misalignment alters the subsequent evolution, making the endpoint \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) dependent on both the properties of L and the form of \\\\( m(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
