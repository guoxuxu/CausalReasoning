  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) models the energy states in a two-dimensional space depending on positions x and y. We explore the effect of a rotational transformation defined by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) applied to a vector \\\\( v = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\ y \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nGiven an observed energy state \\\\( z \\\\), is it possible to determine whether the scaling transformation \\\\( S \\\\), the rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\), or both were applied solely based on the value of \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of scaling and rotation can result in the same energy state, due to the scalar nature of \\\\( z \\\\) which remains insensitive to rotational components. As not all transformations uniquely modify \\\\( z \\\\), distinguishing which were applied based on \\\\( z \\\\) alone is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
