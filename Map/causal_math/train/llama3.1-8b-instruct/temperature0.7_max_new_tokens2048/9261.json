  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit system modeled by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where Z represents impedance as a function of the complex variable s. We are analyzing the impact of a Laplace transform on an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( X(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of the time-domain signal.\n\nIf a periodic signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(s) \\\\) using the Laplace transform and then passed through an electrical circuit described by \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will the output in the Laplace domain \\\\( Y(s) = Z(s)X(s) \\\\) remain the same if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was fed directly into a circuit realizing \\\\( Z(t) \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The characteristics imparted by the Laplace domain processing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will not necessarily match the direct time-domain processing due to damping and phase shift characteristics unique to the Laplace domain. \\\\( Z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) implicate different system responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
