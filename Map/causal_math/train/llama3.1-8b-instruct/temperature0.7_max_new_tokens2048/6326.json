  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x' = Lx\\\\) where L is a linear operator. The behavior of this system is analyzed when a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is another linear operator, is applied.\n\nObserving the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, can one infer the exact initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking the information about the application of \\\\(h(x) = Mx\\\\), it is inherently challenging to pinpoint \\\\(x_0\\\\) because the transformation \\\\(M\\\\) could have modified the initial state in a way that is indistinguishable from natural evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) after time t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
