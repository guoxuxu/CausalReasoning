  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain z as \\\\( f(z) = c^z \\\\) for a constant c. Analyze how the Laplace transform impacts this function when converted using an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after an intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine whether the original function was \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or another function with different parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The non-uniqueness in the effects of functions in the complex domain and the properties of the Laplace transform mean that multiple different functions, possibly with different parameters, could lead to the same transformed result, especially after an intervening transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
