  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state vector. We investigate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix, applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it's not feasible to backtrack uniquely to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the possible transformation by \\\\( D \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) can modify the initial conditions in a way that is not reconstructable solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\), due to the influence of matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
