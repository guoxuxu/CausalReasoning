  "Problem": "Investigate the interaction of a discrete dynamic system characterized by the linear mapping equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), in which M is a constant matrix. Consider the transformation induced by the function \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix that acts at a specific moment.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at \\( n = 0 \\) and then allowing the system to evolve under \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\) without further intervention result in the same state at \\( n = N \\) as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\( n = N \\) under \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) alters the initial conditions. As the states evolve linearly by M, having changed the initial state to \\\\( D x_0 \\\\) introduces a change at each step proportional to powers of M and D, leading to a different state at step N unless M and D commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
