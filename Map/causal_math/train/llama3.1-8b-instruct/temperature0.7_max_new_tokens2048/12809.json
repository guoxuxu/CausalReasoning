  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), typically representing a harmonic oscillator. We study the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial velocity condition \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and its impact over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original initial velocity \\\\( v_0 \\\\) after observing the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform fundamentally alters the initial velocity's characteristics, affecting the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Without knowledge of the transform being applied, it is not possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( v_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) due to the altered frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
