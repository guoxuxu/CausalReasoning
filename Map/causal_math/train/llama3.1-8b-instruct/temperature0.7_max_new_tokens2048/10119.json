  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nIf at certain time t_1, a new function \\\\(h(z) = Wz\\\\) (where \\\\(W\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(U\\\\) and not on \\\\(V\\\\) or \\\\(W\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(z)\\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent not just on the original transformation \\\\(U\\\\) but also affected by both \\\\(V\\\\) and \\\\(W\\\\). As with \\\\(V\\\\), the unitary transformation through \\\\(W\\\\) affects the trajectory of the system leading to a different endpoint based on how these transformations interplay.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
