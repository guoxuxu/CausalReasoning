  "Problem": "Analyze causal behavior in a system undergoing Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Scenario dives into whether the performance and predictions of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems governed by convolution integrals \\\\( (f * g)(t) = \\\\int_0^t f(\\\\tau) g(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) can be inferred or influenced by certain transformation functions.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in its Laplace transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\\\), and knowing the system's impulse response \\\\( g(t) \\\\) also in the Laplace transformed form \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\), can the input function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) be precisely determined?",
  "Explanation": "By the manipulation of the Laplace domain expressions, knowing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\), one can compute \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{L}(y)(s)}{\\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s)} \\\\), assuming the non-zero transform of g(s). Subsequent inverse transformation provides the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
