  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) by a different exponential decay \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\) (where \\( \\beta \\neq \\alpha \\)) at time \\( t_1 \\), will the final Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t \\to \\infty \\) be independent of the initial \\( \\alpha \\)-decay?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform will exhibit characteristics influenced by both exponential decays \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) and \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\). The effects of these alterations do not cancel out but rather accumulate, leading to compounded shifts and broadening in the frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "intervention → modification of z(t); modification of z(t) → different exponential decay; different exponential decay → change in Fourier transform; change in Fourier transform → dependence on initial α-decay"
