  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. The impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is analyzed to understand its effects on the solution trajectory over variable \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\(f(x) = e^{ax}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant, and then allowed to evolve according to the partial differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(u(t, x)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) correspond to the direct evolution from \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(x) = e^{ax}\\\\) introduces a change in the spatial component of the initial condition, which affects the entire solution trajectory of the differential equation. Specifically, it alters the spatial frequency components of \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\), leading to a different state at time \\\\(T\\\\) under unchanged temporal evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
