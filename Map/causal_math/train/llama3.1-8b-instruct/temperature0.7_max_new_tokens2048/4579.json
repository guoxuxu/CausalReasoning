  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{αt}z \\\\) where \\\\( α \\\\) is a complex constant, applied at different points in the time evolution.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{βt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( β \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( ω \\\\) and not on \\\\( α \\\\) or \\\\( β \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another transformation, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes influenced by \\\\( α \\\\), \\\\( β \\\\), and \\\\( ω \\\\). Each transformation, \\\\( e^{αt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{βt} \\\\), affects the trajectory independently by modifying its exponential growth rate and phase rotation, leading to a resultant state that reflects all influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
