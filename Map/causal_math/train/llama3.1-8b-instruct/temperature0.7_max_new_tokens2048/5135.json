  "Problem": "Assess the relations within a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. We explore interventions and transformations mediated through the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with a new function \\\\( k(x) = Nx \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by \\\\( D \\\\) irrespective of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the intervention \\\\( k(x) = Nx \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation, meaning the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only relies on \\\\( D \\\\) but also is influenced by both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). The sequence and particular effects of these matrix interventions preclude a trajectory solely dependent on \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
