  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Question the impact of applying a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^k \\\\) at different times, where k is a positive integer.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another complex number) is applied as an intervention to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the original transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and not on the dynamics of A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic influenced by B, which alters the evolution trajectory. Hence, the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), results from composite effects of A, B, and the original transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), compelling it to depend on all these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
