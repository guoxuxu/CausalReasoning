  "Problem": "Analyze a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a matrix representing the system's dynamics. We consider the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial state, which alters the state's frequency components.\n\nIf a corrective linear transformation \\\\(H\\\\), another matrix, is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\) post original transform, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and not on the properties of H?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(H\\\\) as a corrective measure adds another layer of transformation, thereby making the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) dependent on both the effects of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and the actions of \\\\(H\\\\). This intervention modifies the trajectory and hence the final state, depending on how H interacts with the evolved components of the Fourier-transformed state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
