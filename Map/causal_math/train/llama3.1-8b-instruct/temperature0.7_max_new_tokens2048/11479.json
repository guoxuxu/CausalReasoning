  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing trajectories in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is affected by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b\\\\overline{z} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention applies a new operator \\\\( M(z) = cz + d\\\\overline{z} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are also complex constants), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the properties of \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the system's evolution, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial operator \\\\( L \\\\) and the intervening operator \\\\( M \\\\). The interaction between these operators, especially considering the complex conjugates, significantly influences the trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
