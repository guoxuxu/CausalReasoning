  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and w is a complex variable. Suppose we perform an integral transformation on z(w) given by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sw}z(w) dw \\\\), where s is another complex constant.\n\nIf during the transformation another function \\\\( h(w) = e^{Cw}z(w) \\\\) (where C is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention at an intermediate point w = w_1, will the resultant \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) for t > w_1 be influenced by A alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(w) \\\\) changes the function being transformed, introducing dependency not only on A but also on C and s. The nature of \\\\( h(w) \\\\) suggests that the transformations due to A, C, and the integration parameter s all contribute to shaping the final output \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
