  "Problem": "Consider a fluid mechanic system where the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t \\\\vec{v} + (\\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{v} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} \\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{v} \\\\). We introduce a scalar field temperature \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) affected by both convection and diffusion, described by the advection-diffusion equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t T + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla T = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf an intervention alters the diffusion coefficient \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in a controlled manner, does the resultant temperature distribution \\\\( T(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the new diffusion coefficient and not on the previous velocity field changes?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the change in \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), the temperature distribution at time T depends on both the altered diffusion dynamics and the prior state and evolution of the velocity field. The changes in \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influence the initial conditions and trajectory of temperature distribution.\" ",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
