  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\), where D is the Laplacian operator. Analyze the influence of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf a modification via an Inverse Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[u](x) = \\\\int e^{ikx} \\\\hat{u}(k, t) dk \\\\) is inserted as an intervention at time t_1, does the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on D without influence from the initial Fourier Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The initial Fourier Transform coupled with the later Inverse Fourier Transform intervention modifies the trajectory and the intermediate state of the system. The overall effect on the solution at time T does not solely depend on the Laplacian but also on the changes introduced by these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
