  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}B u(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and u(t) is a control input. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform on the control signal u(t), denoted as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\), and its impact on the transformed system output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) \\\\) is altered and the system is allowed to evolve under its original dynamics without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) \\\\) and the system matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system is linear, the output in the Laplace domain \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) is directly determined by the transformed control input \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) \\\\), and matrix operations involving A and B. The expression \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sI - A}B\\\\tilde{u}(s) \\\\) reflects this linear dependence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
