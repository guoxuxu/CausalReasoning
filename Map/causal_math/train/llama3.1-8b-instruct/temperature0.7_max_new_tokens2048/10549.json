  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = u_0 + iv_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own intrinsic behavior, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) effectively rotates the initial vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) in the complex plane by an angle of \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\). This results in a different trajectory, leading to a distinct state at time T compared to the untransformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
