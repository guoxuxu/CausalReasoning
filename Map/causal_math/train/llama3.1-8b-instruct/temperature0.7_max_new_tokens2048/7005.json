  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number and \\( t \\) is time. This function represents a point moving in a circle on the complex plane. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\), on this function over the frequency domain \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) is analyzed using the Fourier transform without any additional manipulation of the function, will \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) show a delta function at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is indeed a delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\). This result directly follows from the properties of the Fourier transform, which maps each frequency component of \\( z(t) \\) to a delta function at its corresponding frequency in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
