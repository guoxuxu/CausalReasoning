  "Problem": "Consider a system where a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where A is a constant complex number. The function influences the trajectory over time t.\n\nConsidering a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) only depend on \\\\(B\\\\) and not \\\\(A\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) serves as an additional modification to the trajectory, making the final state dependent on \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\). Each transformation could significantly alter the path and therefore the final state as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
