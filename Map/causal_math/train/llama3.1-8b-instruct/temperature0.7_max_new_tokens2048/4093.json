  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the resulting function is left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > 0 be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) under the same operator?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation that alters only how we represent the function, not its intrinsic properties under the linear operator L. Thus, the evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) gives equivalent results in the frequency domain and the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
