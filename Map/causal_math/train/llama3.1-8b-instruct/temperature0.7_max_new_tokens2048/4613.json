  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). We investigate how modifying the original function impacts its Laplace transform, and vice versa, particularly focusing on an exponential function applied as \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) and we perform the Laplace transform, will the result \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for any \\\\( s \\\\) be effectively equivalent to a translation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) on the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) results in the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{-at}f(t))(s) = F(s+a) \\\\). This is essentially an s-domain translation of the function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\), directly attributable to the multiplication of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with the exponential decay term.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
