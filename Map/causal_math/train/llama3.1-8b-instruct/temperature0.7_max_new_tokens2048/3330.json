  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a complex number matrix and z is a complex variable. The function is applied in a system undergoing transformation by a linear operator represented by matrix B. We evaluate the relationship between the application of complex function and how the system evolves over time.\n\nGiven the state of the system at \\\\(z = Z\\\\), can we determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, there is ambiguity regarding the initial state. The nonlinear nature of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) could mean multiple potential starting points \\\\(z_0\\\\), leading to the same final state \\\\(Z\\\\) under operator \\\\(B\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
