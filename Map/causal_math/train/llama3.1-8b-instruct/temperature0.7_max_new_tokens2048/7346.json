  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) evolve over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constants A, B, C, D. We examine the role of an integral transformation, \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds\\\\), applied to z(t).\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transform \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied, one cannot uniquely determine whether subsequent evolutions of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) are due to the natural progression from \\\\(z_0\\\\) or modified by the integral effects. The impact of the transformation \\(T(z)\\) can mask the original state, particularly influencing the dynamics governed by A, B, C, and D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
