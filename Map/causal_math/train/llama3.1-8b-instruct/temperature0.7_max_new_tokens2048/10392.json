  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect on complex numbers in the context of the complex plane transformation. We investigate how this transformation influences the properties of integration along a closed contour C, before and after specific interventions.\n\nBased on the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclusively identify which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping impacts of the transformations and the potential for equivalent integrals from different transformation sequences, it's impossible to uniquely determine the exact transformations applied based solely on the final integral value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
