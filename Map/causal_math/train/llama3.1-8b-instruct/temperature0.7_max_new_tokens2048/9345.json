  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and its inverse operation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and evolved based on the transformed heat equation without further modifications, will the inverse-transformed \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for any T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) were directly evolved using the original heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the Fourier and inverse Fourier transformations are exact and lossless, leaving the evolution process unaltered. Therefore, the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) remains consistent with the direct evolution using the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
