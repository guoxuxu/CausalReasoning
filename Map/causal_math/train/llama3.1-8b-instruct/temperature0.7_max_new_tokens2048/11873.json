  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) dt \\\\). The behavior of the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is analyzed under different settings, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\), can we uniquely determine that the original function was \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\) is uniquely determined by the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\). Hence, observing this result allows us to infer that the input function must have been \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
