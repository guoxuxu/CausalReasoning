  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a system described by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where f(t) represents a function of time t. We explore the transformations of this function through multiplication by another function g(t), and how it impacts the system using another transform, the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and then processed through the Laplace transform, will the resulting transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)f(t)\\\\} \\\\) remain unchanged compared to the individual transforms \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without any additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the product of functions involves convolution in the transform domain. Thus, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)f(t)\\\\} \\\\) does not simply equal the product \\\\( G(s) \\\\cdot F(s) \\\\), making the resulting transform altered by the specific interaction between g(t) and f(t) through convolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Multiplication of f(t) and g(t) → Product of F(s) and G(s); Processing through Laplace transform → Convolution of f(t) and g(t); Convolution of f(t) and g(t) → Product of F(s) and G(s)"
