  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The impact of a transformation, defined by \\\\( g(z) = R(t)z \\\\) where \\\\( R(t) = e^{iNt} \\\\) (N being a constant complex matrix) on the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and is then evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) until time T without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iNt} \\\\) which influences the trajectory based on how the matrices N and M interact, leading to different states at time T unless N and M commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
