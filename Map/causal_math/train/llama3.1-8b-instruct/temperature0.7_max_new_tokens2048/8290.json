  "Problem": "Consider a network of resistors in an electrical circuit, where the voltage is governed by the equation \\\\(V = ZI\\\\), with \\\\(Z\\\\) being the impedance matrix, which is a function of the complex frequency \\\\(s\\\\). Now, a Fourier transform of the voltage signal \\\\(V(s)\\\\), noted as \\\\(\\\\hat{V}(s)\\\\), introduces a transformation by the function \\\\(f(V) = e^{st}V\\\\). We evaluate the effects on current \\\\(I\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nCan we infer the initial voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the voltage transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(f(V)\\\\), and given that a change in voltage would affect the resulting current, it's impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\(V_0\\\\) as the transformation could have fundamentally altered its initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
