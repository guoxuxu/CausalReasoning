  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) (where \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency) applied to a signal transformation described by the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{s(t)\\\\} = S(\\\\omega) \\\\). We examine the impact of modifying the frequency component by multiplying the original signal by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a different frequency modulation \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final Fourier transform of the signal depend strictly on the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and not on the interventions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z'(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) lead to sequential frequency shifts of the signal which affect the final Fourier transform. If \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is modified first by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and later \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), the final spectrum will reflect compounded shifts given by both transformations, impacting the resulting frequency spectrum substantially.",
