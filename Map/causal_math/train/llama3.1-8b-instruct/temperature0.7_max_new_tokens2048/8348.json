  "Problem": "Consider a scalar linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = kx\\\\), where k is a real constant. The Laplace transform of x(t) is used to obtain the transfer function, and various filters represented by transfer functions \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p}\\\\) are applied, where p is a pole introduced by the filter.\n\nGiven the final output state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at t=T, can one determine exactly which poles (p or q) or their combination were active during the system's evolution, only by analyzing \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which filters were used (if any), solely based on the end state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is highly challenging without additional information. Similar end states can be achieved through various configurations of filters and poles due to the superposition effects in the Laplace domain and the linearity of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
