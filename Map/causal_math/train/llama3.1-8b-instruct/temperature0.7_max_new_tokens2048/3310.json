  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iz\\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\\\\). We investigate how the results of further transformations and initial conditions evolve through the system.\n\nCan the original function \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) at a later time T if no information is provided about the intervention with \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the transformation, which integrates over an exponentially modified trajectory, retrieving the precise initial function \\\\(z_0\\\\) from the outcome of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) without a priori knowledge of the application of \\\\(T\\\\) is not feasible. The transformation obscures the original characteristics of \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
