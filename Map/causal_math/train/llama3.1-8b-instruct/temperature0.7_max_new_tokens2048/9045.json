  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed along contour C at time t = 0, and then contour is changed to C' at a later time without further intervention, will \\\\( F(z) \\\\) computed at t = T along C' be the same as if calculated along C?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the complex integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is generally dependent on the choice of the contour due to the residue theorem and potential singularities enclosed by the contour. Changing the contour can potentially change the contributions from these singularities, thus altering the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
