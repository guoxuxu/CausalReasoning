  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is examined over time.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( M[z] = 2z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformation result \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the behavior of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without considering the effects of \\\\( M[z] \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by scaling, and thus both the nature of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the characteristics of the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) along with the exponent decay factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) contribute to the final value of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\). The output is influenced by how these factors integrate \\z(t)\\ over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
