  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nGiven a final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing how the function evolved temporally if no interventions have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even without intervention, the loss of phase information and the nuances introduced by the Laplacian operator in a complex function setting can result in multiple potential initial states giving rise to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to precisely backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
