  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( F \\\\) to form \\\\( u'_0 = F(u_0) \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\) without further intervention, will the eventual solution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) be the same as if it started from \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the initial condition by altering frequency components. Since the operator \\\\( L \\\\) typically acts differently on different frequencies, the evolution trajectory of \\\\( u'_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\) will differ from that of \\\\( u_0 \\\\), resulting in a different solution at any later time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
