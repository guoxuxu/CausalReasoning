  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation equations \\\\(x(t) = Ax(0)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The behavior of the system is examined when subjected to an external force through the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where another function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) (C being a constant matrix) is used, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of transformations B and C provided the initial progression was as per A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) as an intervention influences the system's trajectory, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on the matrices B, C, as well as A. The interaction among these transformations (due to their exponential nature which might not commute) significantly affects the outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
