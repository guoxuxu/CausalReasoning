  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of an initial condition transformation described by \\\\( g(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{kt}\\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform and k is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of \\\\( u_0 \\\\), potentially altering how these components evolve under the operator \\\\( L \\\\). The changes in the frequency domain due to \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) result in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
