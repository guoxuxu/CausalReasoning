  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nCan we determine the exact function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) after \\\\( L \\\\) has been applied, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( Lf \\\\) provides enough information to reconstruct \\\\( f(x) \\\\) accurately, as it translates the operation of \\\\( L \\\\) into the multiplication by \\\\( -k^2 \\\\), which is uniquely invertible in the space of functions typically considered in this setting.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
