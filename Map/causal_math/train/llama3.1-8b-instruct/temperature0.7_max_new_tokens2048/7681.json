  "Problem": "Let's consider two complex functions \\( f(z) = e^z \\) and \\( g(z) = \\sin(z) \\) applied to a complex variable \\( z \\). The behavior of these functions under the Laplace transform is studied, where the transformation is denoted \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\) and applied as an intervention.\n\nIf the function \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex variable \\( z_0 \\) and then \\( z(t) \\) is analyzed without intervention under the transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} \\), will \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{z_0}\\} \\) where \\( T \\) corresponds to the transformation parameter?",
  "Explanation": "The application \\( f(z) = e^z \\) directly corresponds to the exponential transformation under the Laplace transform, and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{e^z\\}\\) is a standard result in transform analysis. No additional complexities alter the transformation, hence \\( z(T)\\) closely follows the expected transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
