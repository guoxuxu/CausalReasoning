  "Problem": "Let's consider a time-dependent quantum system governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H(t) = H_0 + V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H_0 \\\\) is the time-independent part of the Hamiltonian and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent potential. We explore the outcomes of applying unitary transformations defined by \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\) on the state function \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a time-independent Hamiltonian.\n\nIf \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is applied to a state function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( H(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state function \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( H(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\) modifies the initial state, causing the evolution pathway under \\\\( H(t) \\\\) to diverge from the original trajectory. The interaction between \\\\( B \\\\) and the components of \\\\( H(t) \\\\) leads to a different final state at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
