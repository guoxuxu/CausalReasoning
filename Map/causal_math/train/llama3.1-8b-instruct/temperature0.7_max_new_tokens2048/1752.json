  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex system behavior given by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-\\\\tau)A} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input of the system.\n\nIf we observe an output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the system, can we conclusively determine which intervention (whether altering \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( x(t) \\\\), or neither) was applied during the period [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions or alterations (either in \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( x(t) \\\\), or both) can lead to the same output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the complex interplay of matrix exponentials and the input function. Determining the specifics of the interventions solely based on the output without additional information is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
