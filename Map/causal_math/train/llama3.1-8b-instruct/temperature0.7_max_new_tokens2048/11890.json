  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2tz \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + ct \\\\) (where c is a constant) at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T still reflect only the initial differential equation without considering the influence of c?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new term ct to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting the subsequent trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modification alters the function used in the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), impacting the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, thus the final result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) incorporates the effect of the constant c as well as the original differential equation.",
