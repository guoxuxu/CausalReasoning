  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(x, y) = \\\\int_{0}^{y} e^{At} x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function. We assess how applying an operational matrix \\\\( H \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) when integrated to time \\\\( y \\\\).\n\nGiven the final integrated value of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), can we definitively conclude which transformations (if any among \\\\( H \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)) were applied during the course of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)'s evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation scenarios involving \\\\( H \\\\), \\\\( G \\\\), or both can lead to the same value of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\), especially in cases where these matrices can have compensatory or commutative interactions. This non-uniqueness prevents exact deduction of interventions from the outcome alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
