  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nSuppose an additional transformation \\\\( K[f](t) = tf(t) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the function behavior from 0 to T be a straightforward composition of effects from \\\\( Z(t) \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( K \\\\) modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by scaling it with the time variable, which changes both the amplitude and potentially the phase progression depending on \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The interaction between these transformations is not merely additive or multiplicative but complexly integrative, affecting the entire subsequent behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
