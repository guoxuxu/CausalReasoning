  "Problem": "Let's analyze the behavior of a particle moving in a complex potential field described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = p(t) + iq(t)\\\\) where \\\\(p(t)\\\\) and \\\\(q(t)\\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates in a plane and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z + F(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\(F(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent force function.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) an additional damping factor represented as \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha > 0\\\\), is introduced to the system, will the subsequent trajectory of the particle for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) still reflect the characteristics governed by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) fundamentally alters the dynamics of the system by reducing the amplitude over time. This interference means the resulting motion is governed by both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), with the damping effect increasingly dominating as time progresses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
