  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a filtering by \\( g(t) \\) (where its Laplace transform is \\( G(s) \\)) is applied to \\( v(t) \\), resulting in \\( w(t) = (g * v)(t) \\), will \\( W(s) \\) at a later time depend only on \\( V(s) \\) and not \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\( g(t) \\) introduces another convolution, and hence, in the Laplace domain, \\( W(s) = G(s)V(s) = G(s)H(s)U(s) \\), which indeed depends on \\( G(s) \\), \\( H(s) \\), and \\( U(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
