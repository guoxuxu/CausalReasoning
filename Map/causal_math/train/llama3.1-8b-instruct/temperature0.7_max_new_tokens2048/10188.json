  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a control system operates following a linear equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), with K being a constant coefficient matrix and u representing external control influences. Suppose an experimental transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) is introduced, where A is another constant matrix.\n\nDetermining from the state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to exactly infer which transformations or control inputs (starting vector, use of \\\\( f(y) \\\\), or changes to control vector \\\\( u \\\\)) were applied only from the endpoint data?",
  "Explanation": "The complexities introduced by matrix exponentiation and control additions mean that the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial states, transformations, and control inputs. The interplay between A and K, along with variability in u, means multiple different starting conditions and interventions could yield similar endpoints, making it impossible to definitively backtrack the exact interventions solely based on end data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
