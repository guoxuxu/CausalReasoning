  "Problem": "We consider a mathematical model where two complex variables, z and w, are related via the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\) at an initial time t = 0. Over time, w evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\), with A being a complex constant. We examine the influence of an early intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\) defined by the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\) without intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was evolved to t = T under \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) introduces a dependency of z on w through the exponential term, which changes how z evolves due to changes in w. Since \\( w(t) \\) evolves differently due to A, the evolution of z also differs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
