  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve according to coupled differential equations. Introducing the Laplace transform, the new dynamics are described by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t) + iy(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\hat{w}(s) \\\\) of the system after intervention, can we determine whether the original system was described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) with similar properties?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the operational transformation and the integral dependency in \\\\( w(t) \\\\) means that multiple original functions, such as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), could result in similar or identical \\\\( \\\\hat{w}(s) \\\\) outputs. The non-injective nature of the Laplace transform in relation to different time-domain functions obstructs the ability to uniquely backtrack to the original functional form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
