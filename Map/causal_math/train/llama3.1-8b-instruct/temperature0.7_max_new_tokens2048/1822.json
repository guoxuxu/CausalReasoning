  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa\\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of a Fourier transform on this function as an intervention.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we know the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\), one can work backwards from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) using the inverse of the integrating factor and other manipulations to precisely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The differential equation provides a unique solution traceable from any given state back to its initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
