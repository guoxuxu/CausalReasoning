  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at a specific time to a different constant \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and then \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed, will the location of poles in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend only on the latest value \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and not on the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform reflects the state after the intervention; thus, the poles (indicative of system stability and behavior) in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend on the post-intervention frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Previous values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) do not affect the resultant transform assuming a stationary process and no memory of past states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
