  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit system modeled by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where Z represents impedance as a function of the complex variable s. We are analyzing the impact of a Laplace transform on an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( X(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of the time-domain signal.\n\nCan we uniquely determine whether the function \\\\( W(s) \\\\) was applied, and its form, based on the final output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, considering that we are aware \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) was used in the process?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the possible overlap in effects between different modifications such as \\\\( W(s) \\\\) and other potential interventions, and given that such interventions could produce similar effects in the Laplace domain, it is impossible to ascertain uniquely whether and what type of \\\\( W(s) \\\\) was involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
