  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = L(h(t))  = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\). We analyze the effect of modifying this system by convolution with another function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed system's output in the Laplace domain \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we pinpoint exactly what interventions were applied (whether convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both), just by examining \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome in the Laplace domain, \\\\( Z(s) = H(s-b-c) \\\\), may correspond to multiple combinations of shifts (values of \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)), making it difficult to ascertain precisely what interventions were used based solely on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Different pairings of \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) might produce the same result, obscuring the specifics of individual contributions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
