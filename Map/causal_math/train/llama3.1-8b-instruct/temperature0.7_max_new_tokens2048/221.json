  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(t, y(t)) = \\\\int_0^T k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a function of time evolved from initial conditions under some autonomous differential equation. We test causal reasoning about the impact of modifying the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).\n\nIf the kernel function \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is changed to \\\\( k'(t, s) \\\\) at time t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve without further modification, will the transformed output \\\\( g(t, y(t)) \\\\) remain unchanged at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel function modifies the integral transformation, thus affecting the resulting function \\\\( g(t, y(t)) \\\\). The interaction of the kernel with the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) through the integral will result in a different output when the kernel is altered.",
