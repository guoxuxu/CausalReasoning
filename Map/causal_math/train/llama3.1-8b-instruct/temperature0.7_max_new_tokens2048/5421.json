  "Problem": "Consider a curved surface in the 3D space described by the equation \\( z = f(x,y) \\). We explore the effect of multiple complex transformations on this surface. Specifically, we look at transformations represented by \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) where C is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied to the surface \\( z = f(x,y) \\) and the system is then left to evolve under natural geometric constraints without further intervention, will the resultant surface at time \\( T \\) be identical to the original surface \\( z = f(x,y) \\) evolved naturally?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) fundamentally alters the initial geometry of the surface, affecting how it interacts with its environment and evolves over time. Specifically, the transformation introduces a complex exponential scaling that will change curvature and surface properties, leading to a different configuration at time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
