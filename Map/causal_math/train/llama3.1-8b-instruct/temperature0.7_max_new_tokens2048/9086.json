  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) representing a heat distribution over a rod along the spatial variable x and time t, governed by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effects of applying a source term \\( S(x,t) \\), which varies along x and t.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) at time \\( t = T \\), can we determine whether the source term \\( S(x,t) \\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information on the presence or absence of the source term or details about the initial conditions, it is challenging to attribute changes in the distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) directly to \\( S(x,t) \\) or the initial setup.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
