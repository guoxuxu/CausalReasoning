  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) over time is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally over time without any transformation, then the integral transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = \\infty \\\\), will \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\) yield the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\) directly calculates the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without any alteration, the outcome of the integral transformation will be the analytical Laplace transform of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
