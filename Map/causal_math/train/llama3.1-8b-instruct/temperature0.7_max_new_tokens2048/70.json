  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow problem represented by the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, y) \\\\) and governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. To analyze the system behavior, a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential function.\n\nFrom observing the flow field \\\\( \\\\vec{v}(x, y, t) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial velocity field configuration accurately without knowing whether \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the field was altered by adding \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\), recuperating the original flow configuration is ambiguous. The transformation could have set different initial conditions, resulting in divergent flow paths.",
