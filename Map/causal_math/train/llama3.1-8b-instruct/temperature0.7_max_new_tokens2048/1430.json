  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\\\( u' = Du \\\\), where D is a linear operator acting on a vector space V. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation, defined by the operator \\\\( T(u) = Evu \\\\), where E is a matrix and v is a scalar, and then examining the system's response over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine the original pre-transformation state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( T(u) \\\\), it is impossible to backtrack accurately to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) since the transformation could have altered \\( u_0 \\) in a way that is not reversible using only the information of \\( u(T) \\) under the evolution \\\\( u' = Du \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
