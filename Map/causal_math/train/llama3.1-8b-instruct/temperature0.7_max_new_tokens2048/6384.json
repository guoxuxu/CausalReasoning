  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The function describes a rotation in the complex plane over time t. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the computed results of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) followed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) up to time U, can we determine if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied after \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by analyzing the state at time U?",
  "Explanation": "Post-application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) integrates the function up to T, and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) transforms this by derivation from T to U. The derived state at U reflects recent information influenced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and t, effectively masking whether the integral or derivative, or both, were applied prior since the latest operation dominates the resulting state.\"  ",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
