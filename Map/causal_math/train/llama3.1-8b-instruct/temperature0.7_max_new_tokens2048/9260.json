  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine the changes introduced by performing a Laplace transformation on \\( z(t) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).\n\nGiven the result of \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\), can we determine definitively whether the transformation, the multiplication by \\( e^{at} \\), or both were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise interventions just from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) is problematic because multiple combinations of \\( a \\), \\( \\omega \\), and \\( s \\) can end up producing similar effects in the Laplace domain. The transformation and the multiplication interaction complicate retracing the exact sequence or form of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
