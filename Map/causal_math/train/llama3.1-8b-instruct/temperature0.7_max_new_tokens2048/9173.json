  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit where the input voltage \\\\(V_{in}(t)\\\\) is related to the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) via a transfer function defined by \\\\( I(t) = K \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{A(s-t)} V_{in}(s) ds \\\\), where K and A are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( V_{in}(t) \\\\) is a constant voltage applied from t = 0, and then the circuit parameter A is altered at t = 0, will \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the original parameter was maintained?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter A modifies the transfer function's response to the input voltage. Since \\\\( e^{A(s-t)} \\\\) depends on the value of A, any alterations in A would directly affect the output current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) by changing the integral's value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
