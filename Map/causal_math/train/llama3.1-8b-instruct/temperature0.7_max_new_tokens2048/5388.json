  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The investigation involves examining the effects of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and its impact over the function transformation through \\\\\n\nGiven the final state observed in the Laplace Transform, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were involved (whether \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\), or both) solely based on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects in the Laplace domain where multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) can result in similar or the same modifications in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), it's impractical to uniquely pinpoint which transformations were applied based on the final \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone. The transformations potentially result in similar frequency and decay modulations in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
