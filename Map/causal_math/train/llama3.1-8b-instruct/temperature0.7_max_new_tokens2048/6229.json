  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal x(t) is subjected to a linear transformation using an operator L. The transformed signal is represented as y(t) = L{x(t)}. Further, an integral transform T defined by T{y(t)} = ∫y(t)e^{-st} dt is applied to y(t).\n\nDoes applying the linear operator L to the signal x(t), followed by the integral transform T, yield the same result as directly applying T to x(t) without first applying L?",
  "Explanation": "The linear operator L modifies the structure of the signal x(t), leading to a new function y(t). The application of the integral transform T on this altered signal typically results in a transformation that cannot be equated to applying T directly to the original x(t), unless L and T have specific compatibility or commutation properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
