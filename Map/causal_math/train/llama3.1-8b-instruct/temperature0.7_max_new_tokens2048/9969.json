  "Problem": "Evaluate the stability and causal inference of the system governed by the linear partial differential equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We consider the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\)\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0)\\\\) is applied at t = 0, and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) till time t = T, will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) under the same differential equation and then applying the Fourier transform at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the linear differential equation preserves the evolution of the function because the transform linearly maps the original function's differential properties in the frequency domain, allowing consistent transformation across both initial and transformed states over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
