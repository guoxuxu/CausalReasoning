  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation under the action of a linear operator defined by \\\\( L[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw \\), where the operation is along a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) without any further operations, will \\\\( L[f](z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = z_0 \\\\) be equal to directly computing \\\\( L[f] \\\\) from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = z_0 \\\\) without modifying \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) by \\\\( L \\\\) computes the integral of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) along a path from 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), which remains consistent regardless of the pointwise computation of \\\\( f \\\\) beforehand. The action of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) essentially summarizes the area under the curve of \\\\( z^2 \\\\), which does not depend on the pointwise values but on the complete function from 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
