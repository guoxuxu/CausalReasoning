  "Problem": "Consider a mapping of functions where \\\\( g(u, x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x, z) \\\\) are integral transforms with respective kernels \\\\( K_1 \\\\) and \\\\( K_2 \\\\. The system explores the influence of transformations \\\\( u(x) = \\\\int K_1(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int K_2(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), analysing dynamics between input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and output \\\\( z(x) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( K_1 \\\\) at some time to \\\\( K_1' \\\\), does the final output \\\\( z(x) \\\\) still trace its causality solely to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) assuming no change in \\\\( K_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing \\\\( K_1 \\\\) to \\\\( K_1' \\\\) alters the mapping from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) \\\\), and hence indirectly influences the final output \\\\( z(x) \\\\). Despite no changes in \\\\( K_2 \\\\), the transformation due to \\\\( K_1' \\\\) introduces a new causal pathway that modifies the effect observed at \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
