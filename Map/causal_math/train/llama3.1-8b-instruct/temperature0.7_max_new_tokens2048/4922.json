  "Problem": "Analyze a vector field transformation under the system \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. The transformation in question is defined by the mapping \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) = P\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where P is another constant matrix and affects the vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) at time t=0.\n\nCan we trace back the original vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) requires knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) = P\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) was applied. Without this information, multiple potential initial conditions, influenced by P, could lead to the observed state at time T, especially if P and M do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
