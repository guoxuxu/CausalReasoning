  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\), where A and B are constant scalars. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} ds \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax^2 + Bx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T match that of an evolution from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the initial conditions, typically changing the integral curve of the differential equation. The new initial condition modifies not only the path but potentially the entire behavior of the system, especially given the nonlinearity introduced by \\\\( Ax^2 + Bx \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
