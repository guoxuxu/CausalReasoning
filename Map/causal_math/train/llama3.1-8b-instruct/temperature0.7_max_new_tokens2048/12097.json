  "Problem": "Assume a problem in complex functions where the operation involves applying the Fourier transform on a function \\(\\phi(t)\\), which is described as \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). The transformed function is then acted on by a linear transformation \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), which alters frequencies in a specific predictable way.\n\nCan the original function \\(\\phi(0)\\) be deduced after observing the Fourier-transformed \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi(T))(\\omega)\\) output, without knowledge if any intermediary operation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The relationship between \\(\\phi(0)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi(T))(\\omega)\\) might be non-injective, particularly if the dynamics under \\(A\\) or the properties of the Fourier transform obscure or alter specific features. Specific properties like loss of amplitude information cannot be recovered uniquely without additional constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
