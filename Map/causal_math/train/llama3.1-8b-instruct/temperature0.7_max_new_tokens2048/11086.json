  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effects of applying Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as its inverse and interactions due to various potential modifications.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), can the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be uniquely determined without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), when correctly obtained and under the right conditions (assuming all prerequisites of Laplace Transform such as region of convergence are met), can uniquely recover \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). This deductive recovery is a direct feature of the inverse transformation process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
