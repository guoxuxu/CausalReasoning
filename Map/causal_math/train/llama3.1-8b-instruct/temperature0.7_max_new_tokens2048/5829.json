  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), and assume a perturbation in the form of multiplication by a complex exponential, \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is an original signal and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency.\n\nIf a signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) initially and then its Laplace transform is calculated, will the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma be the same as the transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma - i\\\\omega without applying \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a function multiplied by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in a shift along the imaginary axis by \\\\( -i\\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, the transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at s = \\\\sigma will indeed be the same as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(\\\\sigma - i\\\\omega) \\\\), corresponding to a simple shift in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "perturbation → multiplication by complex exponential; multiplication by complex exponential → f(t); h(t) → f(t); Laplace transform of h(t) → Laplace transform of f(t); s = σ → s = σ - iω; Laplace transform of f(t) at s = σ → Laplace transform of h(t) at s = σ - iω"
