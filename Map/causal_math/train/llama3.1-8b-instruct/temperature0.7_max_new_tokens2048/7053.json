  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. We explore the impact of the integral transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), applied at time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under its original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) effectively alters the initial conditions by integrating the function over time, which inherently changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the cumulative nature of the integral and the dependency of \\\\( z \\\\) on exponential terms in time. This results in a fundamentally different state at any later time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
