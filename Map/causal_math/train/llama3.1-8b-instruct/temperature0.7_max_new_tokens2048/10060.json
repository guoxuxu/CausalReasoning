  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) applied over time t, with C being another constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine exactly what interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used by merely knowing the complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex due to the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials. Additionally, different combinations of interventions can lead to similar endpoints, resulting in ambiguous histories based on final observations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
