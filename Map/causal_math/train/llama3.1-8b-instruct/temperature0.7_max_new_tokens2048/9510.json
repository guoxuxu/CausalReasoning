  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the system under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix performing a linear transformation.\n\nCan we recover the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) was initially applied, it is impossible to ascertain whether the state observed at t = T originated from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). Lack of this critical information about initial transformation hinders proper backtracking to \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "D → Dx; Dx → x; h → Mx; M → Dx; M → x; x → x(t); x → x_0; x(t) → x_0"
