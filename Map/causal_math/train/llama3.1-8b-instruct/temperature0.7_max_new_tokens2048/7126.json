  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0 \\), commonly known as the wave equation, where \\( c \\) is the wave speed. The study focuses on the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2x^2} u(x,t) \\, dx \\), where \\( s \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) for some \\( t = T \\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\( u(x,0) \\) without knowing whether \\( T \\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) integrates \\( u(x,t) \\) against a Gaussian, which can significantly alter distribution characteristics, such as peaks of \\( u(x,t) \\). Without knowing if \\( T \\) was applied, or the nature of its application (e.g., time and/or parameter \\( s \\)), it is infeasible to accurately trace back to \\( u(x,0) \\) as many different initial conditions could lead to the same transformed outcome at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
