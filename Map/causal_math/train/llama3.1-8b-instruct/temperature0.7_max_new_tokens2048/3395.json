  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and its interaction with different operational kernels. Through this scenario, we explore a system modeled by the equation \\\\( L[g(t)](s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2 + b^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf an additional multiplying function \\\\( h(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant) is introduced at a time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) as an intervention, will the resultant function in the s-domain be independent of the parameters \\\\( c \\\\) and solely depend on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) = e^{ct} \\\\) results in the Laplace transform operation being modified. The resultant s-domain function would shift by \\\\( c \\\\), leading to a function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{(s-c-a)^2 + b^2} \\\\), thereby affecting the outcome with dependency on \\\\( c \\\\) as well as \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
