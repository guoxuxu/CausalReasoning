  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\\\( F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) from the transformed function \\\\\\( F[z](s) \\\\\\) without additional information? Assume \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) initially was \\\\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\).",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\\\( F[z](s) \\\\\\) mixes the frequency components and temporal characteristics into a complex exponential integral that typically requires inversion and additional information on the original frequency \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\). Without this, the original form \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) cannot be uniquely retrieved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
