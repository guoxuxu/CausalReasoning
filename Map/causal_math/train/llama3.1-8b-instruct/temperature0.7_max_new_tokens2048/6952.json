  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(\\\\alpha + i\\\\beta)u} z(u) du \\\\) with constants \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\) of the transformation as well as if an intervening transformation like \\\\( S(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing the specific transformations used and their parameters from the endpoint data alone is generally not feasible. Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\), and potential intervening parameters \\\\( \\\\gamma, \\\\delta \\\\) could lead to similar effects in the final output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), especially given the integral's property to blend changes smoothly over time. This ambiguity makes exact retrieval of transformation details impossible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
