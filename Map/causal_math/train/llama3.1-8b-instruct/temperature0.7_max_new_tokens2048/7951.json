  "Problem": "Consider a linear system undergoing a Fourier transform, which converts a function of time, \\\\( g(t) \\\\), into a function of frequency, \\\\( G(f) \\\\). The impact of an additional Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} = G(s) \\\\) on this system is explored over time and frequency domains.\n\nIf we apply a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} = G(s) \\\\) as an intervention after the Fourier transform, will the resulting \\\\( G(s) \\\\) only be governed by the initial application of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform acts as an intervention altering the frequency-domain representation by incorporating decay factors and exponential shifts. Thus, \\\\( G(s) \\\\) will not solely depend on the initial Fourier transform but will be significantly influenced by the characteristics of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
