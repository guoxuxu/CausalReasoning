  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{αt}z \\\\) where \\\\( α \\\\) is a complex constant, applied at different points in the time evolution.\n\nProvided the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) being the result of potentially multiple overlapping complex exponentials makes it difficult to discern exact interventions uniquely. The interplay of the magnitudes and phases affected by \\\\( α \\\\) and \\\\( β \\\\) could produce equivalently viable trajectories leading to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), obscuring the identification of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
