  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function z(t) defined as z(t) = e^{At}w, where A is a complex constant matrix, and w is a complex vector. The function represents the evolution of z over time under the influence of matrix A, and we are interested in how various transformations, represented by another complex matrix B, affect this evolution.\n\nIf at a specific time t = t1, a new transformation g(z) = Cz (where C is another complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state of z(T) for T > t1 be solely dependent on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The final state z(T) is influenced by the initial transformation B, the matrix A which defines the evolution over time, and the intervention with matrix C. Each of these components contributes to and potentially modifies the trajectory of z, making the output at time T a combination of these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
