  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), described by the equation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-P} \\\\) where P is a complex constant. The integrative effect of a modification function \\\\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\\\) applied at time t=0 is analyzed, where k is a positive integer.\n\nIf \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from t=0 and then is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) under the original Laplace description, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) \\\\) at any s be identical to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\\\) alters the function before the Laplace transform is applied. The transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(t^k u(t))(s) \\\\) yields different results due to the multiplication by \\\\( t^k \\\\), affecting the s-domain representation differently than \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
