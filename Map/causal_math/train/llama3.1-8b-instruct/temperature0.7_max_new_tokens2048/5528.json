  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the consequences of applying a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( Mz = az + b \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) being complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to ascertain precisely which interventions (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) were utilized, simply by analyzing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The variety of transformations possible through different parameters within the matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) leads to a multitude of possible trajectories and final states. Thus, identical endpoints could result from various combinations and sequences of interventions, making it infeasible to uniquely identify the interventions based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
