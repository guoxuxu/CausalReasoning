  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of an electrical circuit where the resistance R(t) can change over time, and the voltage across the resistor V(t) is given by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = I(t) R(t) \\\\), where I(t) represents the current. We explore the cases under the transformation defined by multiplying the current by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(I) = e^{i\\omega t}I(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) is applied to the current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the circuit is allowed to operate under its original conditions without further intervention, will the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( I_0 \\\\) was directly used to determine \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) modifies the phase of the current. Because the voltage depends on both the magnitude and phase of the current relative to the resistance, the resulting voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) will not merely be a scaled version of the original but will also experience phase shifts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
