  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf we observe \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or if it started from z_0?",
  "Explanation": "Given just the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and depending on the properties of matrices A and C, it is often not possible to definitely distinguish whether the initial condition was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). The influence of the exponential matrix function and the initial condition being potentially scaled by C makes it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
