  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the solution to the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\), and K is a constant matrix. Explore the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at various times, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with a new transformation \\\\( j(w) = e^{Mt}w \\\\) (where M is a constant matrix) is applied, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on K and not on D or M?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) applied at different times introduce additional dynamics to the system. These influence the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and, consequently, of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Hence, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends not just on K but also on D and M due to these interventions affecting the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
