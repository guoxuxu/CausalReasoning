  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor arranged in series (RLC circuit). The voltage across the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L, R, C \\\\) are constants and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is the input voltage function. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to the input voltage function.\n\nIf an adjusted input voltage function \\\\( V'(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(s\\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(V)(s)) \\\\) (essentially a derivative operation in the Laplace domain) is applied as an intervention to the circuit, will the resulting current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) still strictly depend only on the characteristics \\\\( L, R, C \\\\) of the circuit?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by modifying \\\\( V(t) \\\\) in the Laplace domain and applying its inverse to the circuit introduces new dynamics. The altered input will impact how the differential equation governs the current \\\\( i(t) \\\\), adding dependency on the form and nature of the intervention beyond just the constants \\\\( L, R, C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
