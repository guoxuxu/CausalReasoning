  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) that represents a complex function on the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). For a complex domain transformation defined by \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\), we investigate how this affects the mapping of points over an interval from x = 0 to x = 2\\\\pi.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), then allowing it to evolve from x = 0 to x = 2\\\\pi, will the resulting path on the w-plane cover all points in the unit disk?",
  "Explanation": "The mapping \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) represents a unit circle in the complex z-plane as x varies from 0 to 2\\\\pi. Squaring this in the w-plane (\\\\( w(z) = (e^{ix})^2 = e^{2ix} \\\\)) maps it to another circle in the w-plane as x varies from 0 to 2\\\\pi, covering every angle twice, but still mapping to all points on the unit circle.",
