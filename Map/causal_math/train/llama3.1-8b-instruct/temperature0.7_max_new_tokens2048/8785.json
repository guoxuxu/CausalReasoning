  "Problem": "Consider a system where the surface area of a sphere changes over time according to the radius which grows linearly with time according to the equation \\\\( r(t) = kt \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. The rate of change of the surface area, \\\\( S \\\\), with time can be derived using the formula \\\\( S = 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\). We examine how transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(r) = \\\\alpha r(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a scaling constant, influence the rate of change of the sphere's surface area over time.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( f(r) \\\\) to the radius \\\\( r_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then let r(t) evolve under the same linear growth without further transformation, will the final surface area, \\\\( S(T) \\\\), at T be the same as if the radius was grown from \\\\( r_0 \\\\) without applying \\\\( f(r) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(r) \\\\) directly scales the radius by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), which when squared, scales the surface area by \\\\( \\\\alpha^2 \\\\). Thus, this initial scaling changes the entire growth trajectory of the surface area, resulting in a final surface area different from the untransformed case, namely \\\\( S(T) = 4\\\\pi (\\\\alpha kt)^2 \\\\).",
