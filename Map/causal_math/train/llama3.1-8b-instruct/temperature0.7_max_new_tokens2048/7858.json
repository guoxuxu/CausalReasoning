  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its application within a Laplace Transform context \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\). This scenario explores how the transformation behaves under varying conditions and manipulations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we deduce that the original function was \\\\(f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\) without knowing the nature of its divergence?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) does not uniquely specify \\\\(f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\) in cases of divergence such as this. Other discontinuous or undefined behaviors could potentially yield similar problematic transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
