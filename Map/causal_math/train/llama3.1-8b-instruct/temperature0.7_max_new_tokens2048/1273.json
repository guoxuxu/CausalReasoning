  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{tA}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( g(t, x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sB}x \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix, applied at time zero.\n\nIf only \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and progressed to time \\\\( T \\\\) under the described condition, will the function \\\\( u(T, x_0) \\\\) remain unaffected by matrix \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since only the function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) involving matrix \\\\( A \\\\) is affecting the vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) will be solely determined by \\\\( e^{TA}x_0 \\\\) and independent of matrix \\\\( B \\\\). Matrix \\\\( B \\\\) is not involved in the transformation or evolution of the system in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
