  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The function maps to the transformation with integral transformation operator \\\\( T \\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any modification, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be solely dependent on the original parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) will result in \\\\( Z(s) = x / (s - i\\omega) \\\\), which depends strictly on the initial parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), following the direct application of the Laplace transform to the exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
