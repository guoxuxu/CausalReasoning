  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a partial differential equation shown by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analyze the scenario where a transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is performed, with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) representing the Fourier transform.\n\nIf \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform \\\\( h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) transforms the function into frequency space, altering initial conditions. The evolution of these initial conditions under L in the frequency space will give different results compared to the original function space, hence leading to a different state \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
