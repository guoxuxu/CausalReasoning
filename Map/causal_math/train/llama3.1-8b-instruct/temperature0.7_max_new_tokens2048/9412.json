  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. The system is subject to manipulation by a transformation \\\\(h(u) = u + e^{Kt}\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final observation of \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\), can we conclusively determine the interventions applied (whether \\\\(h(u)\\\\), \\\\(q(u)\\\\), or any other) solely based on knowledge of \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations and initial states, especially accounting for the non-linear dependency and interactions among \\\\(L, K,\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\). The manifold ways in which these operators interact make it challenging to exactly pinpoint which interventions were executed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
