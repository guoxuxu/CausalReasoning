  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a continuous time Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform of the same function. Let \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and let \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nConsidering the final outcome of the Laplace transformation on the altered function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2}t^2 \\\\), is it possible to conclusively identify if either the alteration or a previous Fourier or Laplace application caused the resulting transformed expression?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact cause (whether the alteration, previous Fourier transform, or Laplace transform) solely from the final Laplace outcome is not feasible due to the convolution of effects and the inherent nature of the transforms. Each transformation and modification potentially changes the response in a profound manner not allowing backtrack of the exact cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
