  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis based system where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = az^2 + bz \\\\), with constants a and b. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nCan we determine precisely which transformations or interventions (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on observing the function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), several plausible combinations of transformations (using different constants c and d) could lead to similar compositional outcomes due to intrinsic properties of exponentials and integrations. These result in overlapping effects that cannot uniquely pinpoint which transformations were applied without additional contextual information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
