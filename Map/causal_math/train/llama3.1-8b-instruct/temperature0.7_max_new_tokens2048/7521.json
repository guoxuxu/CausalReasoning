  "Problem": "Consider a controlled heat equation on a metal rod along the x-axis modeled by \\\\(\\\\partial_t u(t, x) = k \\\\partial_{xx} u(t, x) + f(t, x)\\\\), where u represents the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(f(t, x)\\\\) is a heating function that varies with time and position.\n\nIf an initial heat source distribution \\\\( f(t, x) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and evolves under the heat equation without additional inputs, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T be solely determined by the initial conditions and the diffusivity constant k?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further interventions or sources are added to the system after the initial application, the evolution of temperature is solely governed by the heat equation with its initial conditions and the inherent properties of the equation, specifically the diffusivity constant k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
