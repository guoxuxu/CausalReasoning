  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore how the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) and its modification by a function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affect the system.\n\nGiven the observed Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we conclusively identify if and when the intervention \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) was deployed through the heat process?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific timing or presence of the intervention \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) from the Fourier transformation at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is challenging without additional information. The transformative effects of \\\\( g \\\\) on \\\\( F(u) \\\\) overlap with possible natural evolutions of the heat equation, obscuring clear inference of the intervention timeline or specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
