  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t, z) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. We study the impact of an intervention defined by the transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = t^k z \\\\) where k is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for some fixed s be the same as if \\\\( f(t, z_0) \\\\) was directly evolved under the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = t^k z \\\\) modifies the integrand function, specifically influencing the moment of the variable t to a different power, thereby altering the result of the integral transformation fundamentally based on the parameter k.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
