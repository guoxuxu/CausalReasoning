  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables. We study the function transformation by the integral kernel \\\\( K(s, t) = e^{-st} \\\\) under operation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(s,t) f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) = t+it^2 \\\\) is transformed at initial time and then calculated at time T using \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\), does the transformation retain the linear relation between real and imaginary parts under the integral operator?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation through the kernel modifies the structure of the function where the integration of the real part \\\\( t \\\\) and the imaginary part \\\\( t^2 \\\\) with exponential decay factor leads to a non-linear relation in the transformed output.",
