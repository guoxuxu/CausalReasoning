  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nIf at some moment \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{iCt}z\\\\), where C is a real constant, is applied as an intervention, will the system's endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of B after applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention complicates the trajectory further by adding another rotational effect, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent on the interactions among A, B, and now C. Each contributes to the overall rotation experienced by \\\\(z\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
