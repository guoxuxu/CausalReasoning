  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt \\\\), which is a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Explore how modifying the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) affects the transform, and consider the impacts of two types of modifications: multiplication by a scalar function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and addition of another function \\\\( w(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( u_y(z) \\\\) derived from \\\\( y(t) = x(t) + w(t) \\\\), and if we only know the transform \\\\( u_x(z) \\\\), can the function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and invertibility of the Laplace transform for addition, knowing \\\\( u_y(z) \\\\) and \\\\( u_x(z) \\\\) allows for the unique determination of \\\\( u_w(z) \\\\) by subtraction. Since the inverse Laplace transform is unique, this means \\\\( w(t) \\\\) can be uniquely identified, given that the transforms are properly defined and invertible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
