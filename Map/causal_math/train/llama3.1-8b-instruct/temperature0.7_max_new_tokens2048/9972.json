  "Problem": "Evaluate the stability and causal inference of the system governed by the linear partial differential equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We consider the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\)\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine definitively if a transformation (Fourier or Laplace) was applied at any point solely from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) without knowing the intervention explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "The analysis of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) alone, without additional context or intervention timelines, does not allow for definitive backtracking of whether and which transformations were applied. Both transformations could yield similar states at \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), especially if they commutate with L, leading to ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
