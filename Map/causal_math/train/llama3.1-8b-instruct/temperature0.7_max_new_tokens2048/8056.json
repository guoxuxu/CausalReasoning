  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\). The functions are subjected to transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), such that \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s)ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence or the specific transformations (\\(T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both) that were applied, just by knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of the matrix exponentials in the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) coupled with the integral build-up creates multiple pathways to reach the same final state, \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Since both shares the same kind of impact on the trajectory (integral of exponential transformations), determining the precise interventions or sequences just from the completion (final state) is inherently ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
