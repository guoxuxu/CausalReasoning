  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{ut}z \\\\) (where u is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of w and only dependent on i and u?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on i, w, and u. The transformations \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{ut} \\\\) interact with the dynamical system, affecting the system's trajectory and hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
