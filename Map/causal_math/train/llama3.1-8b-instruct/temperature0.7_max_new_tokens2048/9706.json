  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar frequency. Analyze the behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform result \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we conclude that the non-intervened function was exactly \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the unique correspondence between exponential functions and their Laplace transforms under conditions where \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\neq i\\\\omega \\\\), the inverse transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) recovers the original function uniquely as \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
