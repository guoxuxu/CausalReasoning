  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. We assess the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform applied to both components x(t) and y(t).\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied as an intervention to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a specific time t1, will the state of the system at time T, post t1, depend only on the original differential equations and not on the characteristics of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention involving a Fourier transform introduces additional modifications to the system state by altering the frequency spectrum of both x and y components. Consequently, the final state at time T is influenced by both the natural dynamics dictated by the original differential equations and the spectral changes imposed by the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
