  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nCan the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified from the final state at t = T, without knowledge whether the transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\), you cannot uniquely determine the initial function. The transformation could significantly alter the function's trajectory, making it impossible to recover the original function uniquely based solely on its evolved state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
