  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the system under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a matrix performing a linear transformation.\n\nIf immediately after applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(x) = Nx \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( k(x) = Nx \\\\) qualifies as a secondary intervention, modifying the state trajectory again. As a result, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is dependent on M, N, and D. The interactions between these matrices determine the ultimate state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
