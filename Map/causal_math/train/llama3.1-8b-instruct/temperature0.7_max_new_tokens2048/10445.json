  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the impact of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) over time t, where M is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T differ from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the given differential equations to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the dynamical system by scaling and potentially rotating it. As the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) can change both the magnitude and direction of the initial complex number, this can alter the trajectory in the complex plane, leading to a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any future time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
