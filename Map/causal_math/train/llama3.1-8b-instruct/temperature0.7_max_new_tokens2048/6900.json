  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the combined response output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) after the intervention with the new voltage source, can we precisely identify what the original voltage \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) were?",
  "Explanation": "Ascertaining the exact forms of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v'(t) \\\\) solely from the combined output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is impractical without further information, due to the superposition principle of linear systems. Without knowing the specifics of each source's frequency and amplitude, multiple voltage configurations might yield the same convolution output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
