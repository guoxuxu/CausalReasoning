  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{sL + R}} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) represent the resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. We investigate the impact of applying a Laplace transform to the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), and its effect on the system’s output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a filtering function \\\\( F(s) = e^{-s\\\\tau} \\\\) (representing a time delay \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\)) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention before inputting into the system, will the output at any subsequent time only depend on the transformed properties derived from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the input signal in such a way that the new input \\\\( X'(s) = X(s) \\\\cdot F(s) \\\\) carries the effects of the time delay. Consequently, the output not only reflects the properties of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) but also the specific nature and time of the intervention, yielding a different output due to the shifted dynamics introduced by \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
