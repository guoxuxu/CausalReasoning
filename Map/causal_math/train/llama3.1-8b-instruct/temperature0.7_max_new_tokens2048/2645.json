  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to their respective differential equations, \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied for causal analysis.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is calculated for the initial conditions \\\\( x(0), y(0) \\\\) under the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without intervention, does \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at some complex frequency s solely depend on the initial values \\\\( x(0), y(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Under natural evolution without intervention, the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves deterministically based on \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\). The transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) encapsulates this evolution across the entire timeline, making it dependent solely on these initial conditions via the exponential decay imposed by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
