  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Lz\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) defined by \\\\(z_T(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(t, s) z(s) ds\\\\) is applied to the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(z_M(t) = \\\\int_0^t M(t, s) z(s) ds\\\\) (where \\\\(M(t, s)\\\\) is another kernel) is introduced as an intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be unaffected by the earlier transformation \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation changes the system dynamics again, adding to the effects of the earlier integral transformation \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\). The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will thus be influenced by both \\\\(K\\\\) and \\\\(M\\\\), along with the intrinsic dynamics dictated by \\\\(L\\\\). The interaction of these kernels can significantly alter the state at time \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
