  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions describing the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. We are concerned with how these components transform under the operation \\\\(w(t) = e^{kt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(w(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (whether initial, subsequent, or none) were applied, based solely on the state of \\\\(w(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar final states \\\\(w(T)\\\\) could result from different combinations of initial conditions and interventions. The effects of exponential transformations like \\\\(e^{kt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{ht}\\\\) can overlap and lead to equivalent states for differing parameters \\\\(k\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\), making it challenging to identify specific interventions uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
