  "Problem": "Explore the relationships in a mathematical model where the periodic function \\\\( x(t) = cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by the integral transform \\\\( L\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( L \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the result is analyzed analytically, does the output solely reflect properties of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any additional input?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L \\\\) directly applies to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any external manipulation or additional functional changes. The output is purely based on the integral properties involving the constants \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), typical of Laplace transform characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
