  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in the time domain is directly transformed to the frequency domain and back without any modification, will the recovered function in the time domain be identical to the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of the Fourier transform and its inverse, transforming a function to the frequency domain and back unaltered should perfectly reconstruct the original function, assuming the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) satisfies the necessary conditions for the Fourier inversion theorem.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
