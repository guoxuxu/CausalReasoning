  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing a system's state over time. The system is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the output from the transformation \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at all points \\\\( t \\\\) in \\\\( [0, T] \\\\) without any knowledge of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) is an integrated effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from time 0 to T. Due to the nature of integration, multiple different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result in the same output after undergoing the transformation, especially without additional constraints on the function's form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
