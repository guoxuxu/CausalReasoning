  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis based system where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = az^2 + bz \\\\), with constants a and b. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention via another transformation \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{dt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where d is a constant, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting affected endpoint \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original parameters a and b and not on c or d?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with another transformation \\\\( S(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system, involving another exponential term. This modifies how the function accumulates and integrates over time, thereby making the endpoint dependent on c and d along with a and b. Both integration transformations intersect in their effects, altering the final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
