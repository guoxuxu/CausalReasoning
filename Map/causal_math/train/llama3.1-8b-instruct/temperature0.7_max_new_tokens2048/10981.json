  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. Let's explore if conversions via Laplace transform, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) impacts causal inference concerning \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes the application of the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its inverse transform keep the function unchanged, assuming no other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "If the Laplace transform is correctly applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the conditions for the existence of the transform and its inverse are met, then applying the inverse transform should return the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This is due to the linearity and bijectiveness of the Laplace transform in its domain of definition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
