  "Problem": "Consider a smooth manifold M in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\) equipped with a vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\). Analyze the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T(p) = \\\\int f(p) dp\\\\) on the manifold, where \\\\(f(p)\\\\) is a smooth function.\n\nBy observing the manifold M at a later time \\\\(T\\\\) and the flow lines there, can we specifically trace back and determine which transformations (either \\\\(T(p)\\\\), \\\\(G(p)\\\\), or both) were applied at earlier times?",
  "Explanation": "Given the superposition and possible mutual influence of the transformations \\\\(T(p)\\\\) and \\\\(G(p)\\\\) on the manifold, and the intrinsic properties of the vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\) affecting the trajectory, it's impossible to deterministically parse out which transformations were applied from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
