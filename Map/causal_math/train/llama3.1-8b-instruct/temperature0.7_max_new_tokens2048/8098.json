  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is also a constant complex matrix, on the system over time t.\n\nCan we conclusively trace back to the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could have modified the original state in a non-invertible way, especially without exact knowledge of D and its relationship with C, making it impossible to definitively determine the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
