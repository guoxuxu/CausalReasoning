  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the variable z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant, and i is the imaginary unit. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is also a real constant.\n\nCan we ensure, based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), which transformations (either \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied and at what times, relying only on the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the exponential functions \\\\( e^{-Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) make it difficult to isolate and determine exactly which transformations were applied at specific times. This overlapping effect and potential non-commutativity mean the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may correspond to multiple possible intervention histories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
