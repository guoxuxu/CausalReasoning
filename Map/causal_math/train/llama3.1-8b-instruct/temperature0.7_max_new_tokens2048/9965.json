  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is directly applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\), and \\\\( z(x) \\\\) evolves under its original definition without further changes, will the resulting transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) \\\\) be a delta function centered at \\\\( k = w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) yields \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - w) \\\\), which is a delta function centered at \\\\( k = w \\\\). This outcome results from the integral of the product of two exponentials with opposite signs, which simplifies to a delta function due to the properties of the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
