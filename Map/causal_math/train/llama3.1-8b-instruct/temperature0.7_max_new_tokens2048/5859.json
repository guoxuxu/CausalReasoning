  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nSuppose a damping factor \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant, is introduced as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\). Does the combined impact of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the damping factor from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to T make \\\\(y(T)\\\\) independent of the initial frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) adjusts the amplitude but not the frequency of the transformation. Even though the signal is now dampened, the effect of the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) embedded in \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) on the phase of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) remains critical, influencing the final form of \\\\(y(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
