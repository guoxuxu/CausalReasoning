  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\). We explore the behavior of this transformation under different conditions and study the causal inference between the input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and its transformed counterpart \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformation outcome \\\\(F(s)\\\\) that includes the exponential term \\\\(e^{-st_0}\\\\), can we ascertain that a delta function intervention at \\\\(t_0\\\\) was the sole modification to the original \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\( e^{-st_0} \\\\) in \\\\(F(s)\\\\) indicates a delta function at \\\\(t_0\\\\), but it does not exclude the possibility of other modifications to \\\\(f(t)\\\\) that may not uniquely alter the transform in a distinguishable way from existing terms. Thus, the information about other potential changes is ambiguous without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
