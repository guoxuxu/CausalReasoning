  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{tA}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( g(t, x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sB}x \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix, applied at time zero.\n\nIf observing the resultant vector \\\\( u(T, x_0) \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) had been applied without knowledge of the initial application?",
  "Explanation": "Observing just the resultant vector under \\\\( u(T, x_0) = e^{TA}x_0 \\\\) does not provide information about potential effects of \\\\( B \\\\), as \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) was not part of the process. Thus, without additional information, it is not conclusive whether \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) (integral transformation involving \\\\( B \\\\)) was ever applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
