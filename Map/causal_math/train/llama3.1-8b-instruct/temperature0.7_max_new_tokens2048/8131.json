  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) representing a complex valued function, where \\\\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\\\). We analyze the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ h(z) \\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) also belongs to the complex plane.\n\nIf, after the initial Laplace transform, an additional filtering function \\\\( G(s) = \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha} \\\\) (with \\\\( \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is convolved with \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the resulting function have poles only where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) originally had?",
  "Explanation": "Convolving \\\\( H(s) \\\\) with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain constitutes a multiplication, which essentially adds the pole(s) of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) to those of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). If \\\\( H(s) \\\\) originally had poles at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), the resulting function will also have a pole at \\\\( s = -\\alpha \\\\) due to the multiplication by \\\\( G(s) \\\\). This alters the pole structure and introduces new dynamics in the transformed domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
