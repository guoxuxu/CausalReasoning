  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents propagation in time under a harmonic oscillator dynamic with a certain frequency. We introduce an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i \\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to conclude with \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\beta t} \\\\) for remainder of the time, will the application of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) show effects dependent only on \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function's frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and since the integral transform \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) accumulates the effects from 0 to T, the resulting function post-intervention isn't just dependent on the new frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) but also on the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
