  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) is used to solve the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = f(t) \\\\). The transform function is applied to both sides leading to an algebraic equation in the complex domain.\n\nIf an additional input \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is introduced into the system as an intervention, resulting in the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = f(t) + g(t) \\\\), and we opt to solve via the Laplace transform, does the outcome \\\\( y(t) \\\\) reflect the combined effect of both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of the Laplace transform, specifically linearity, ensure that the transformed equation incorporates the effects of both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) linearly. The resultant \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from inverting the Laplace transform of the combined transform correctly represents the cumulative effect of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) on the system.",
