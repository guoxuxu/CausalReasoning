  "Problem": "Consider the effects of applying a complex transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iw}z \\\\) on a vector field governed by a Laplace equation \\(-\\Delta u = 0\\). We are examining the system's response over time and the causal inference of operations.\n\nGiven the field configuration at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to precisely reconstruct all preceding interventions and transformations, simply by observing \\\\( u(z, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential overlaps and similar effects from the cumulative transformations and interventions make it difficult to determine uniquely the type and sequence of all interventions. Identical or similar results could be produced through different combinations of transformations and temporal adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
