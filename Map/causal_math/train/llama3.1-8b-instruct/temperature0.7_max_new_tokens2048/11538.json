  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nCan we deduce the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over an interval [0, T], given the output of the transformation \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) gives us a cumulative integral value. This information encapsulates more than just the state at a specific time and includes no direct inference about the specific path of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) taken to arrive at this integral, especially without knowing the exact form and parameters (\\omega) of z(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
