  "Problem": "Consider a system where the variable \\\\(z\\\\) is transformed by the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\\\). We analyze the outcome of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) where \\\\(n = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\\\) and its implications on the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another transformation, say \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\), is applied to each element after \\\\(f(z_n) = e^{iz_n}\\\\) and before the DFT, will the final spectrum depend only on the original sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) and not on the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The successive transformations, first by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and then by \\\\(g(z)\\\\), complicate the relationship between the original sequence and its spectrum. Each transformation modifies the sequence in a substantial way – the first by a phase shift, and the second by altering magnitude – and thus the final spectrum depends on both \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) as well as the original sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
