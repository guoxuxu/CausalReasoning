  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We assess the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function, given by the integral \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{iwx} e^{-ikx} dx \\\\), analyzing both the direct transformation and its inversion.\n\nIf an additional phase-shift operation \\\\( h(x) = e^{iqx} \\\\) where \\\\( q \\\\) is real, is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) before the Fourier transform, will the result still be a delta function at \\\\( k = w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the phase shift changes the function to \\\\( z(x)h(x) = e^{i(w+q)x} \\\\). The resultant Fourier transform will be \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(k - (w + q)) \\\\), thus shifting the delta function to be centered at \\\\( k = w + q \\\\), not \\\\( k = w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
