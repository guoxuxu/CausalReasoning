  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(x)) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-(x-t)} u(t) dt \\\\), on functions and its implications in a functional space. We explore whether this transformation can alter or trace back the cause of changes in function behaviors.\n\nGiven the final state of the function after interventions from both \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\), is it possible to accurately determine the sequence or nature of interventions applied only by analyzing the end state?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\) could influence the function in ways that are not distinctly separable after their application. Given their convolution-like nature and overlapping impacts, it is difficult to definitively ascertain the exact interventions from the final function form alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
