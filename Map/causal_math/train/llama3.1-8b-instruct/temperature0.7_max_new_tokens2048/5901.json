  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the effect of a Laplace transformation on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given by the transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), is studied in relation to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}f(t) = ag(t) + bf(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nWill the solution \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to the differential equation at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be influenced by changing the values of a and b if we redefine \\\\( g(t) \\\\) through its Laplace transformation to \\\\( G(s)/s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adjusting the coefficients a and b directly influences the relationship and interaction between \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as per the differential equation. Redefining \\\\( g(t) \\\\) through its Laplace transform as \\\\( G(s)/s \\\\) essentially changes the initial conditions and forced response, meaning \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is not merely a function of initial \\\\( g(t) \\\\) but also how g is processed via transformation and consequent interaction within the differential equation parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
