  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) is computed for \\( z(t) \\) initially at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) without any further transformation, does \\( z(t) \\) at t=T, calculated directly from the differential system, result identically to using \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Convolving \\( z \\) with \\( e^{-st} \\) under \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) would alter \\( z \\)'s evolution trajectory due to the incorporation of the exponential decay term from the integral transform, even if no explicit intervention is applied after \\( \\mathcal{F} \\). This manipulation changes how \\( z \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
