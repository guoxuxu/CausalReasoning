  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) and its original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). We are scrutinizing the influence of a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\) operating on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f(t)] = t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and subsequently transformed by the Laplace Transform, will \\\\( L[T[f(t)]] \\\\) be equal to \\\\( -F'(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F'(s) \\\\) is the first derivative of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) regarding \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The action of multiplying by \\\\( t \\\\) in the time domain corresponds to the operation of taking the negative derivative with respect to \\\\( s \\\\) in the Laplace domain. This is a standard result from Laplace Transform properties, showing a direct causal transformation without modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
