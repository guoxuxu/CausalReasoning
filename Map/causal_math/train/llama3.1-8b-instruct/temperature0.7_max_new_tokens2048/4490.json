  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nIf we have the Laplace Transform of \\(g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t)\\), can we uniquely determine \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\\\alpha\\) just from \\(L(g)(s)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\(L(g)(s)\\) provides the transformed function scaled by \\(\\\\alpha\\), but it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(\\\\alpha\\) without additional constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
