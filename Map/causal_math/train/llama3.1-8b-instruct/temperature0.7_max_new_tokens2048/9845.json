  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The impact of this transformation is studied over the path of the unit circle in the complex plane, described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\in [0, 2\\\\pi] \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the unit circle \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before it starts evolving, does this change the resultant path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) compared to without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) to the unit circle \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) inverts each point on the circle, resulting in the same path since inversion of points on the unit circle still lies on the unit circle. However, the direction of traversal would be reversed, from counterclockwise to clockwise, altering the way the path is traversed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
