  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) before the transformation, where \\\\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( G(s) \\\\) after applying \\\\( L \\\\) becomes \\\\( -G'(s) \\\\), knowing only this transform without confirmation that \\\\( L \\\\) was applied does not allow us to uniquely retrieve \\\\( g(x) \\\\), as the inverse transform of \\\\( -G'(s) \\\\) would indicate a different, altered function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
