  "Problem": "Given a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space, and the transformation defined by \\\\(T(f)(x) = f(x)e^{-x^2}\\\\), we consider the system's behavior when applying various operators or transformations simultaneously.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\(f_0(x)\\\\) by observing the resulting function after applying both \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\) and then \\\\(L\\\\), without knowing the application of \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\) in advance?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\) and subsequent application of \\\\(L\\\\) changes the function in such a manner that reversing the process to retrieve \\\\(f_0(x)\\\\) requires explicit knowledge of both the transformation \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\) and the operator \\\\(L\\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\(T\\\\), the original function \\\\(f_0(x)\\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
