  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by observing the system at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing if the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the Laplace transform, the altered complex frequency domain due to integration makes it impossible to accurately deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) purely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\); the frequency domain information perturbed by the transform obscures the original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
