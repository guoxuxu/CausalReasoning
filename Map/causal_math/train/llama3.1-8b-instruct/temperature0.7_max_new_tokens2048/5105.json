  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of an electrical system characterized by the function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the initial voltage and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Let \\\\( T(V) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty V(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) describe a Laplace transformation of the voltage signal over time.\n\nAssuming that \\\\( s \\\\) is perturbed to \\\\( s + ds \\\\) where \\\\( ds \\\\) is small, and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( T(V) \\\\) at an arbitrary time point be affected significantly by this change in parameter?",
  "Explanation": "A small change in the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the exponential decay or growth rate of \\\\( V(t) \\\\). This alteration affects the integral transformation \\\\( T(V) \\\\), thus changing the system's behavior in the frequency domain, represented by shifts in poles and zeros in the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
