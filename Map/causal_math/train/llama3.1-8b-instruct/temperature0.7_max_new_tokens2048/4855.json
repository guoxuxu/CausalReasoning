  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate how applying different integral kernels, like \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) and transformations, impacts the result of the transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( s_1 \\\\) the transformation kernel is changed from \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-(s+a)t} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number), will the final transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) still be a straightforward Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel partway modifies the transform process, making \\\\( F(s) \\\\) a transform of the modified function \\\\( e^{-at} f(t) \\\\), not just \\\\( f(t) \\\\). This alteration affects the result due to the additional factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) influencing the decay rate and potential convergence of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
