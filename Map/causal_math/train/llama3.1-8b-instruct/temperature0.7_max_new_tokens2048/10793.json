  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is Fourier transformed to obtain \\\\(F(z)\\\\), and then allowed to exist in the frequency domain without further intervention, will the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T\\\\) recover the original function, \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are well-defined linear operations, and no external transformation is applied to \\\\(F(z)\\\\) in the frequency domain. Hence, the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\(F(z)\\\\) will accurately recover \\\\(z(t)\\\\), assuming perfect conditions like infinite integration limits and no signal degradation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
