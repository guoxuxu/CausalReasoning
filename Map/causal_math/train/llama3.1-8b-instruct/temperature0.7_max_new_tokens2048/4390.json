  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. The function acts on an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\)\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) used or its parameter A?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or the matrix A, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since different functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) corresponding to different matrices A could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from different initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
