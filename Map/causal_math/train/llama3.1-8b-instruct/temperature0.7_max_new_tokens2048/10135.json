  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nSuppose that at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied to the system. Will the resulting complex state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the matrices A and B, ignoring the effects of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention using \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) introduces an additional modification to the state, implying that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will also depend on the matrices C and D. The combination of the respective exponentials interacts to modify the trajectory of both the x and y components of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
