  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the changes in the output when a transformation defined by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( h(z) = dz/dt \\) is applied as an intervention, will the form of \\( y(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend only on the dynamics of \\( \\omega \\) and not on the previous transformations or \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) immediately changes the evolution of \\( y(t) \\), basing it on the derivative of \\( z(t) \\), which will still depend on \\( \\omega \\). However, the effects of the integral transformation up to \\( t_1 \\) will have accumulated, thus altering the state of \\( y(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\). Therefore, \\( y(t) \\)'s resultant form depends on both the prior transformation and the frequency, \\( \\omega \\), showing dependence on \\( t_1 \\) as well.",
