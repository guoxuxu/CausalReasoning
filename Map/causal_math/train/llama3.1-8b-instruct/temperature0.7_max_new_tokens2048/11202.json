  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector space given by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) which projects vectors onto a subspace. We explore the effects of applying another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\), which is a rotation matrix, on this vector space.\n\nGiven the final state of a vector at time T, can we determine the sequence of transformations (projection followed by rotation vs. rotation followed by projection) applied to the vector at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the vector alone, without knowing the original state or the details of the transformations, is not enough to clearly determine the sequence of transformations due to the non-commutative nature of general matrix multiplication.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
