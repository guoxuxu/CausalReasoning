  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state of the function at time T, can we unequivocally identify which transformations (either \\\\( T[z] \\\\), \\\\( U[z] \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations used during the system's evolution based solely on the final state at T is generally infeasible due to the integral transformations’ complex interactions and modification of the function's path in potentially non-unique ways. Different combinations of transformations can lead to similar or even identical outcomes, making precise retrospective identification challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
