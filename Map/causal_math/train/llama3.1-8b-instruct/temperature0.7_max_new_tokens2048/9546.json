  "Problem": "We examine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a second-order differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) represents an external driving force. We explore the impacts of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the system.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) remains ambiguous due to the presence of the exponential phase factor introduced by the transformation. This factor alters both amplitude and phase, obfuscating the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
