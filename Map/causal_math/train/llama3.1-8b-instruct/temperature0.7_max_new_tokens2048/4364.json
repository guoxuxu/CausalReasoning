  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the analysis focused on the effect of a complex integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{a}^{z} f(w) dw \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(w) \\\\), which is analytic in a domain D. Assume \\\\( a \\\\) is a fixed point within D.\n\nCan the presence of the transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\exp(z) F(z) \\\\) be determined solely from the observation of changes in the function on the boundary of domain D?",
  "Explanation": "The modifications induced by \\\\( G(z) \\\\) on the boundary values could stem from other transformations similar to \\\\( \\\\exp(z) \\\\), and simply observing boundary changes in \\\\( G \\\\) does not uniquely indicate the specific transformation of \\\\( \\\\exp(z) F(z) \\\\). Distinguishing this specific intervention from others would require additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
