  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), and matrices A, B, C, and D are constants. We investigate the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) for a constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise interventions used is not feasible solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the potential overlap in effects caused by different manipulations of phase and magnitude. The combined effect of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) imply multiple potential parameter pairs could lead to the observed endpoint, making precise identification unattainable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
