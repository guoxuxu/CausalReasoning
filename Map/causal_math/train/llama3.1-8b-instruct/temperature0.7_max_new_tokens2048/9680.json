  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation by the contour integral along a path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in the complex plane. The integral transformation is described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\xi - z} d\\\\xi \\\\), which depends on the path of integration \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\).\n\nCan the original undisturbed path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\), used before applying any subsequent transformations or interventions, be deduced precisely from observing the final output after multiple transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the precise original path \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) from the final transformed output is highly complex due to the influence of subsequent functions and their integration paths. These additional transformations can significantly modify the integral's properties, obscuring the effect of the original path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
