  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) for complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. By defining a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix, we test the effect over a period of time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine which transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used, solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations involving \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) can yield the same final state due to the inherent complexities in how the exponential matrix functions interact with the system dynamics. Differential properties of matrices D and E might foil efforts to disentangle their specific contributions from the final observed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
