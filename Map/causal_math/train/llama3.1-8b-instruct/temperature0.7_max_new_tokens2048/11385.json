  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-zt} dz \\\\). Let \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real positive parameter.\n\nIf we evolve the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over time without intervention, will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation into \\\\( y(t) \\\\) based on the function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) is inherently dependent on \\\\( t \\\\). However, for certain contours or values of \\\\( t \\\\), the expression stabilizes. Specifically, the contribution from the real part \\\\( x \\\\) dominates and yields an outcome that diminishes with increasing \\\\( t \\\\), approaching zero exponentially due to the \\\\( e^{-zt} \\\\) term.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
