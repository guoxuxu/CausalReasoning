  "Problem": "The system is governed by a complex function where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), with A being a real scalar. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iBs} z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a real scalar, is analyzed for its effects on the system over time interval [0, T].\n\nIf an intervention applying a new function \\\\( U(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a real scalar) is introduced at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 not depend on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( U(z) \\\\) imposes yet another complex exponential influence, potentially coupling and interacting with the effects of B and the dynamics given by \\\\( A \\\\). The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) would therefore be influenced by A, B, and C, making the endpoint dependent on all three parameters.",
