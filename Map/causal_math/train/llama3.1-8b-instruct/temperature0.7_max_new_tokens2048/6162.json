  "Problem": "Examine a system characterized by the non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \\\\), and consider the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( g(x) = x + k \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we don't know whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how the transformation was applied, there are multiple potential starting points \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to the transformation parameter k. As the differential equation is non-linear, the possibility of multiple trajectories reaching the same end state cannot be ruled out.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
