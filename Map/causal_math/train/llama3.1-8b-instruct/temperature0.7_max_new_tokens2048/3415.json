  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+P}\\\\), where P is a constant. We explore the consequences of an operation defined by \\\\(v(t) = t^2 * u(t)\\\\) and its inverse Laplace transform.\n\nIf at some point t = t_1, a transformation \\\\(w(t) = e^{Qt} * u(t)\\\\) (where Q is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) for s be dependent purely on P and not on Q or the square of time?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(w(t) = e^{Qt} * u(t)\\\\) will alter the Laplace transform. Since \\\\(w(t)\\\\) compounds another transformation on original \\\\(u(t)\\\\), the final transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) will be a function not only of P but also substantially influenced by the exponential factor with the constant Q.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
