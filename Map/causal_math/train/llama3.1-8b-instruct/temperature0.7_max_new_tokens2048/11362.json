  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze the effect of an initial condition transformed by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given only the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to the potential altering effect of \\\\( e^{Nt}x \\\\), especially if N significantly modifies the state space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
