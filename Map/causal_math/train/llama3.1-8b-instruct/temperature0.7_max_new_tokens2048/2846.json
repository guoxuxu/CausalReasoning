  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function represents a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane. We examine the response of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming no initial conditions.\n\nWith knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), can we uniquely identify the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) and understanding of the Laplace transform properties, one can uniquely reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) via the inverse Laplace transform, assuming proper conditions like causality and stability are met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
