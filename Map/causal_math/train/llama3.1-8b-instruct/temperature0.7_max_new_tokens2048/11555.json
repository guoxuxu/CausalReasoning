  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( N = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the effect of \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The second transformation with matrix \\\\( N \\\\) modifies the state trajectory anew, and thus the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) depends on both matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\). These changes are reflected in the overall transformation effects on the frequency spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
