  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is an analytic solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\), where P is a linear operator. Evaluate how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) influences the system's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is computed at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\) without further modification, will the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be identical to if it was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Pz \\\\) from the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator and does not influence the physical laws governing the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since it is a separate mathematical construct used for analysis and not a physical intervention in the system, it will not alter the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under its governing partial differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
