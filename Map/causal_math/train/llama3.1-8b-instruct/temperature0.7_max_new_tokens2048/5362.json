  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original starting complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, and given that A can alter the phase and magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), it's not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple potential starting points can lead to the same endpoint due to the non-trivial effects of A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
