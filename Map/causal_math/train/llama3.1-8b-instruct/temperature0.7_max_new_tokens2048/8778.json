  "Problem": "Let \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(n\\\\) is a positive integer, define a transformation in the complex plane. Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\lambda z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant with a non-zero real part, describing an exponential decay or growth depending on the sign of the real part of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\). We aim to analyze how applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) affects the solutions over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we recover the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\) was initially applied, determining the exact \\\\(z_0\\\\) becomes ambiguous. Multiple possible values of \\\\(z_0\\\\) could lead to the same observed endpoint under different scenarios concerning the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
