  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a complex constant. We analyze how a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (with R being a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) introduces additional changes based not just on P but also on Q and R. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a product of all three influences, transformed by exponential terms from each of the constants, reflecting an interplay between them.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
