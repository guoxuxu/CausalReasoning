  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u, denoted as \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))(s)\\\\), on the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a different transformation, say Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is introduced at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final representation \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,T)\\\\) depend only on L and not on the initial Fourier or later Laplace transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention introduces another layer of complexity in the system. The final state in the frequency domain not only depends on the operator L but also heavily on the initial and intermediary transformations. Each transformation affects the resultant state through its unique alteration of the domain or characteristic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
