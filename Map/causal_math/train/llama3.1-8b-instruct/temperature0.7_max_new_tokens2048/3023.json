  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, I is the current, and E(t) is a time-varying electromotive force. An analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of adding a linear filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) where C is a constant, initially at time t = 0.\n\nIf a reverse filter \\\\( g(I) = \\\\frac{1}{D}I \\\\) (where D is a constant) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the differential equation and not on the filters C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the reverse filter introduces a competing effect, altering the current further and causing the final state \\\\( I(T) \\\\) to depend on both the initial filter C and the intervention D. The dynamics are thus affected by both transformations, as well as the governing differential equation.",
