  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the Hamiltonian function \\\\( H(p, q) = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are the momentum and position of the particle, and \\\\( V(q) \\\\) is the potential energy as a function of position. We explore the effect of a canonical transformation \\\\( (P, Q) = \\\\phi(p, q) \\\\) on the system's dynamics.\n\nAfter observing the system's transformed state \\\\( (P(T), Q(T)) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely reconstruct the original state \\\\( (p_0, q_0) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing what canonical transformation \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the canonical transformation \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct the original state \\\\( (p_0, q_0) \\\\) from the observed transformed state \\\\( (P(T), Q(T)) \\\\). The transformation could impact initial conditions in ways that are not determinable post-evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
