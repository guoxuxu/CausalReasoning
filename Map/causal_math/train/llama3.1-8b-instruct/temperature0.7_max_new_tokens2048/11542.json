  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we determine the original initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) perfectly after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Without being certain whether the Fourier transform was applied, we cannot confirm the exact initial condition just from analyzing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). Changes brought by switching between the spatial and frequency domains may not be completely reversible without explicit knowledge of all transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
