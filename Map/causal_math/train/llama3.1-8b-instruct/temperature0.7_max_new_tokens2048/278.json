  "Problem": "Consider a mechanical system where the force \\( F \\) applied to an object causes it to accelerate according to Newton's second law \\( F = ma \\), where \\( m \\) is mass and \\( a \\) is acceleration. Suppose a particular transformation \\( h(a) = k \\cdot a \\) defines a modification to the acceleration, where \\( k \\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nCan we deduce the original acceleration \\( a_0 \\) after observing the final position \\( x(T) \\) without knowing whether \\( h(a) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scaling transformation \\( h(a) \\), the observed final position \\( x(T) \\) could correspond to multiple initial accelerations depending on the value of \\( k \\). Thus, \\( a_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\( x(T) \\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The force applied directly causes the acceleration, the mass, and the scaling factor; the acceleration causes the final position and the modified acceleration; the scaling factor causes the modified acceleration; the mass and the original acceleration are causes of the final position; the original acceleration is caused by the scaling factor."
