  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nGiven \\\\( G(s) \\\\) resulting from a direct transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we uniquely ascertain the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) without considering other possible functions?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) suggests the original function could be \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), other functions, e.g., combinations involving delta functions or other exponentials multiplied by certain factors, might also yield the same transform. Without additional details, the original function isn’t uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
