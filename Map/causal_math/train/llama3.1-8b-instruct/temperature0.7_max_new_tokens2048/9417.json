  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transform on the system, focusing on how the transformed impedance \\\\( sL + R \\\\) affects the response.\n\nIf the impedance is changed by introducing a new resistance \\\\( R' \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowing the current i(t) to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\frac{di}{dt} + R'i = V(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the current I(s) in the Laplace domain at a later time s be the same as if only R was considered in the impedance?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new resistance \\\\( R' \\\\) alters the total impedance of the circuit, which affects the Laplace transform of the current. The transform I(s) will differ due to the change in impedance from \\\\( sL + R \\\\) to \\\\( sL + R' \\\\), altering the system's response to the voltage source V(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
