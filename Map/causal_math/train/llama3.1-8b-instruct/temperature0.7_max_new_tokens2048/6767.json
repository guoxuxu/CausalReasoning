  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\). We explore the effects of a multiplied exponential function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and its corresponding Laplace transformation \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention that modifies \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{bt}g(t) \\\\) midway through its evolution, where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant, will the resulting transformation, \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\), directly reveal the effects of both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(t) = e^{bt}(e^{at} f(t)) = e^{(a+b)t} f(t) \\\\), its Laplace transform would be \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ e^{(a+b)t} f(t) \\\\} (s) = F(s-(a+b)) \\\\). This transformation reveals the cumulative effect of both constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) as a combined shift in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
