  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the original time-dependent function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transform in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of applying the inverse transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(G)(t) \\\\), after manipulating \\\\( G(s) = F(s)R(s) \\\\), where \\\\( R(s) \\\\) is a modification function.\n\nIf an external modification function \\\\( S(s) \\\\) is introduced at a certain time, changing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) to \\\\( F(s)S(s) \\\\), will the final output function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not \\\\( R(s) \\\\) or \\\\( S(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( S(s) \\\\) as an intervention alters \\\\( G(s) \\\\), making the resulting function a product of not just \\\\( F(s) \\\\) but also of the effects introduced by both modifying functions \\\\( R(s) \\\\) and \\\\( S(s) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( g(t) \\\\) reflects changes caused by all involved functions, not merely the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
