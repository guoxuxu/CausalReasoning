  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to precisely reconstruct \\\\(z(0)\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\), it is ambiguous whether the initial condition was modified by \\\\(C\\\\). Depending on the value of \\\\(C\\\\), different initial conditions can yield the same state at \\\\(T\\\\), hence it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(z(0)\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) without this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
