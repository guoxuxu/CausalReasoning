  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(u) = e^{Mt}u\\\\), where M is another linear differential operator, on the evolution of function u over time t.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\(u(T)\\\\), can we determine which interventions were applied (whether \\\\(h(u)\\\\), \\\\(s(u)\\\\), or both), just by analyzing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths might result in the same end state due to the nature of exponential transformations and the superposition principle inherent in linear systems. Without explicit tracking or additional constraints, it is impossible to uniquely determine the sequence and kind of interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
