  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The system is subject to different treatment functions, specifically \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) = Tx \\\\), where S and T are constant matrices. Consider how the transformations affect the system's state vector over time.\n\nIf another function \\\\( g(x) = Tx \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T only be influenced by L and not S or T?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(x) = Tx \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies \\\\( x(t_1) \\\\), resulting in a compound effect of both S and T transformation matrices on the system's evolution to \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The state at T is influenced by L (dynamics of system), S (initial transformation), and T (intervention), making it a product of interactions among all three.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
