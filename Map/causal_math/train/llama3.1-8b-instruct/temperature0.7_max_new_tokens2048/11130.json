  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents propagation in time under a harmonic oscillator dynamic with a certain frequency. We introduce an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i \\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the value of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from observing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) without knowing the values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transformation at time T depends on both the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the integrated result over the interval from 0 to T encompasses more than just the initial state. Without precise values of these parameters, deducing the initial state from the transformed output at T is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
