  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time and i is the imaginary unit. This function describes a unit circle in the complex plane. We study the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) where A is a complex number, representing multiplication and rotation in the complex plane.\n\nCan we deduce the initial transformation \\\\( A \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by observing the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without any prior knowledge of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the initial transformation with A, the observed state \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\) could be misleading because any number of transformations (different As) could lead to the same observed outcome on the unit circle, given their periodic nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
