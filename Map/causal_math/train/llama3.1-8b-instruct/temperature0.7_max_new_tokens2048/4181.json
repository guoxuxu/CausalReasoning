  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), and a response function described by \\\\( R(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p} \\\\) where p is a positive constant. The system's output is obtained by the convolution operation in the time domain corresponding to multiplication in the Laplace domain. We study the influence of a feedback mechanism introduced via a transformation \\\\( g(y) = e^{-kt}y \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) initially followed by the response \\\\( R(s) \\\\), and let the system evolve naturally without further transformations, will the final output in the Laplace domain at time T, \\\\( Y(T) \\\\), remain unaffected by not having an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear and time-invariant, under these conditions (without any new transformation added during the process), the transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) followed by \\\\( R(s) \\\\) would only be influenced by the convolution process. Without further transformations or interventions, the output remains a direct consequence of initial conditions and inherent system properties, simply scaled by \\\\( R(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
