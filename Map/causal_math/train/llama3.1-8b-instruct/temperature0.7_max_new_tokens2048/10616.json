  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nCan one accurately determine the original function components \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) solely from knowing the transformed result \\\\( F(z')(T) \\\\) when both frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) were present?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of different frequency components in the integral transformation, and without distinct separability in the frequency domain within the given integral boundaries, it is impossible to precisely discern contributions from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\gamma t} \\\\) in the transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
