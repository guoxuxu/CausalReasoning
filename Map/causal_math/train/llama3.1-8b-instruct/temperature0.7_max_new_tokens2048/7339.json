  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is also a constant complex number.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( k(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{(s-t_1)P}z(s) ds \\\\) (where P is another constant complex number) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and disregard the effects of N and P?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( k(z) \\\\), combined with the earlier application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), means that the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by a combination of the effects of M, N, and P. This integrated effect means that the state at T reflects the compounded impact of all transformations, not just the evolution under M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
