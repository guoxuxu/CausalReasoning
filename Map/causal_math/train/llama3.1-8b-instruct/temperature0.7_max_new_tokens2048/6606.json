  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can one uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), one can directly solve for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by rearranging the equation. The unique determination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is possible as it is explicitly represented in the expression for \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
