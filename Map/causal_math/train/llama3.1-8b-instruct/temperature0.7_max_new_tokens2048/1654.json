  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was processed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and subsequently evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and not the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) before evolution under \\\\( M \\\\), leaves ambiguity in backward tracing to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The integral transformation could have modified the trajectory in ways that are non-reversible solely with the knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
