  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)](k) \\\\) on the function u(x, t).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation defined by another integral transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(\\\\sigma, t) = \\\\mathcal{T}[u(x,t)](\\\\sigma) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) is a general transformation, is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L?",
  "Explanation": "The application of another transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) as an intervention modifies the state in a manner that is generally not commutative with the Fourier transform. Thus, the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) will depend not only on L but also on how the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) interacts with the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
