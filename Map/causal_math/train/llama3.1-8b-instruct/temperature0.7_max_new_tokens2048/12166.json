  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, and the effect of a Fourier transform on functions within this space. Specifically, examine the case where \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), and the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( f \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nSuppose after applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), and before taking the Fourier transform, an intervention modifies \\\\( f \\\\) by adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\). Will the resulting \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\) be unaffected by the value of \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a constant is a delta function at \\\\( k = 0 \\\\). Since the operator L involves differentiation, applying L to a constant gives zero, thus the addition of a constant post L-operation does not affect the resulting Fourier transform except possibly at \\\\( k = 0 \\\\), which is typically handled via normalization or initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
