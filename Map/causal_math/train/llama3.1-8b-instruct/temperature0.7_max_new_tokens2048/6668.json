  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices defining separate dynamical systems for the real and imaginary parts, respectively. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the complex vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the sequence and type of applied interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), both, or neither) solely by knowing the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions and natural evolutions of the system governed by A and B, complicated by additional transformations from C and D. Distinguishing between these scenarios is generally not feasible without additional information due to the overlapping effects of the multiple transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
