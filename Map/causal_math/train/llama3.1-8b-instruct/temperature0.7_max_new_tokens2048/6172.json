  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. We will examine the effects of performing a Laplace transformation on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the final form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely determine the initial condition and whether the intervention \\\\( e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) was applied, based on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention effects and the initial phase shift intricately modify the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), compounded multiplicatively in the complex plane. Different initial phases and intervention moments can yield the same \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely trace back without additional contextual or temporal information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
