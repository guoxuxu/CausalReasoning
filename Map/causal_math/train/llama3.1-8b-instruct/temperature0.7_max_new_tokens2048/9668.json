  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a set of functions defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) represents a rotation by A in the complex plane over time t. Additionally, let there be a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of rotations B and C, along with different timings of intervention, can lead to the same endpoint in the complex plane due to the periodic nature of rotations. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions based solely on the output at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
