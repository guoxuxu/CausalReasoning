  "Problem": "The behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. The impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\), where c is a real constant, is examined over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{dt}z \\\\) (where d is another constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original differential equations and not on the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend significantly on the transformations applied. The interventions with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) both scale the magnitude and affect the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), hence impacting the final state at time T, even if the underlying dynamics are governed by the same differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
