  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are constants. We will explore the effects of applying the transformation defined by \\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), additional feasible paths could have led to the observed \\( z(T) \\). The transformation \\( e^{kt} \\) could have altered \\( z_0 \\) in various ways, making the original state ambiguous, especially in the presence of the non-linear component \\( \\lambda z^2 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
