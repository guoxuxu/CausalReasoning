  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. The Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied to f, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original matrix A, after observing the transformed function over several points in the complex plane, if one is unaware whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the Laplace transform application, we lack complete information on how the observed output was derived. The transformation by B could significantly adjust the manifestations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), misleading any inferences drawn directly back to A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Observation of transformed function → Matrix B; Observation of transformed function → Matrix A; Matrix B → Laplace transform; f(z) → Laplace transform; Matrix A → f(z); f(z) → Observation of transformed function"
