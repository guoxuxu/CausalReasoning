  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its transformation by a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nIf an external time-dependent function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier Transform, will the outcome \\\\( F(z + w)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) still reflect characteristics solely of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without showing influence from \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before the transformation results in the Fourier Transform of the combined function, \\\\( F(z+w)(\\\\omega) = F(z)(\\\\omega) + F(w)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Therefore, the transformed output at each frequency is influenced by both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\), not just \\\\( z(t) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
