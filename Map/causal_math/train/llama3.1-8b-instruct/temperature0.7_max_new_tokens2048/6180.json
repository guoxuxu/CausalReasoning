  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) governing the displacement \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of a string, where \\\\(c\\\\) is the wave speed. To analyze this system, we consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\), transforming the equation into a simpler form.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at some endpoint \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine precisely whether the damping intervention (\\\\(e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\)) was applied, and if so, the value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple damping parameters \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or compositions of different interventions could yield similar or indistinguishable states at time \\\\(T\\\\). Furthermore, information on initial conditions and other intervening effects like initial amplitude distribution also influences the final state, complicating distinct identification of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
