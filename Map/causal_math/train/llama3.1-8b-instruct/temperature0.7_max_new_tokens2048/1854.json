  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the initial function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and time-invariant nature of both the differential operator \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) and the transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\), the initial function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) under the assumption that the inverse Laplace transform is well-defined and \\\\(s\\\\) includes the necessary frequency components to recover \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
