  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = f(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time and solve the integral equations \\\\( x(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)}g(x(s)) ds \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}h(y(s)) ds \\\\). We will analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( Tz = Cz \\\\) at different points in time.\n\nIf we introduce a new transformation \\\\( Dx \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), and allow the system to evolve to \\\\( T \\\\), will the structure of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( h(y) \\\\) alone determine \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention \\\\( Dx \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is modified, thereby affecting the composite output \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the final state will depend on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and the nature of the intervention \\\\( Dx \\\\), not just \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( h(y) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
