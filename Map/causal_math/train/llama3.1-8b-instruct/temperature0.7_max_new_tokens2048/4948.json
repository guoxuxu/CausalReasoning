  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the integration transformation applied to this function over a period \\\\(T\\\\), defined by the integral \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iAt} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant integral value after applying \\\\( G(t) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely determine the applied transformation solely by knowing the resulting integral value?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting integral value can arise from various possible transformations or combinations of matrices \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). Identifying the specific transformation or its parameters based solely on the integral value is underdetermined due to the lack of unique backward traceability from the effect to the specific combination of causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
