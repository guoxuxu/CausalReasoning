  "Problem": "Consider the operation of complex integration along a contour in the complex plane defined by \\\\\n\nGiven a non-zero value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can we conclude that there was definitely a pole within the contour \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "A non-zero integral value does not necessarily imply a pole within the contour as functions without poles can still integrate to non-zero values over certain paths (e.g., closed curves around points of non-analyticity or essential singularities).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(z) → ∫_{γ} f(z) dz; ∫_{γ} f(z) dz → Non-zero value; Non-zero value → Pole within γ; Pole within γ → ∫_{γ} f(z) dz; γ → ∫_{γ} f(z) dz; f(z) → γ; γ → Pole within γ"
