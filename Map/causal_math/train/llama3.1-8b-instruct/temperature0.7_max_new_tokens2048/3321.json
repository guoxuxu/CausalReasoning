  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), utilized in the context of a linear transformation in the complex plane over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The evolution of a complex function \\( g(z) = az + b \\) follows, where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( g(z) \\) is applied without further modification at \\( t = T \\), is the result the same as directly applying \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\) to \\( z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies \\( z_0 \\) through a rotation by \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\), which fundamentally changes the input for \\( g(z) \\). The latter transformation is then applied to a different starting value, producing a distinct result due to the sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
