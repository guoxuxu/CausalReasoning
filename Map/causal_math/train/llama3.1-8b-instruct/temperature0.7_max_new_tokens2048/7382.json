  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions, expressed as \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a potential function. An external spatial transformation is defined by \\\\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(u(h(x, y))\\\\) that satisfies the Laplace equation at time \\\\(t=T\\\\), can we infer that the original function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at \\\\(t=0\\\\) also satisfied it?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing that \\\\(u(h(x, y))\\\\) satisfies the Laplace equation post-transformation does not necessarily imply that the original function \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) did. The transformation could harmonize otherwise non-harmonic components, or the specifics of the constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) might facilitate a unique scenario where the transformed function coincidentally satisfies the equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
