  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The system undergoes an operation defined by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\), where U is a constant, invertible matrix, and t is the time variable.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( g(x) = V^{-1}e^{Mt}Vx \\\\) (where V is another constant invertible matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the resulting \\\\( x(T) \\\\) rely solely on M and not on U or V?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) as an intervention introduces a further transformation that modifies the trajectory, rendering the system's endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on U, V, as well as M. The matrix V especially affects system state since its introduction at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) uniquely alters the resulting system state at any time T > t_1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
