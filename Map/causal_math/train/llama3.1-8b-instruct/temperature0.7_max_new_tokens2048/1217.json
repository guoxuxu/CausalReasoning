  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact of a complex function transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and its corresponding transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( G(s) \\\\), and then the inverse Laplace transform is taken, will the resulting function in the time domain be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was evolved into t^2 f(t) directly in the time domain without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and the application of the inverse Laplace to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) should yield the same result as directly multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( t^2 \\\\) in the time domain due to the correspondence in the properties of the Laplace transform and polynomial multiplication in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
