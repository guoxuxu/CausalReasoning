  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem involving an initial matrix \\u0027X\\u0027. The function \\u0027f(X) = e^{At}X\\u0027 transforms \\u0027X\\u0027 over time \\u0027t\\u0027, where \\u0027A\\u0027 is a constant skew-symmetric matrix. This explores changes under the integral transformation using the Laplace Transform of \\u0027X\\u0027.\n\nIf \\u0027f(X)\\u0027 is applied at time \\u0027t = 0\\u0027 to an initial matrix \\u0027X_0\\u0027 and subsequently evolves without further transformations under natural properties, will the spectrum of \\u0027X(t)\\u0027 at \\u0027t = T\\u0027 be the same as without applying \\u0027f(X)\\u0027?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\u0027A\\u0027 is skew-symmetric, the exponential matrix \\u0027e^{At}\\u0027 is orthogonal. Orthogonal transformations preserve the spectrum of a matrix. Therefore, the spectrum of \\u0027X(t)\\u0027 remains unchanged regardless of the initial application of \\u0027f(X)\\u0027.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
