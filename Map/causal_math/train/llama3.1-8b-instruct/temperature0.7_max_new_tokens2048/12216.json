  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We examine the implications of a functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is enforced on a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from the scenario where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{D0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. However, this transformation changes the trajectory of the system since \\\\( e^{Dt}z \\\\) might vary in ways that cause the evolution under \\\\( C \\\\) to proceed differently due to the specific interaction between D and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
