  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact matrix \\\\( M \\\\) by observing the trajectory \\\\( w(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( M \\\\) explicitly, assuming knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) and given that multiple matrices could produce similar transformations in the complex plane, it's impossible to uniquely identify \\\\( M \\\\) just by observing \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The general properties of complex matrices do not guarantee unique solutions for \\\\( M \\\\) when only outputs are observed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
