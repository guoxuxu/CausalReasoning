  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let's explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( s \\\\), \\\\( s_1 \\\\), an additional function \\\\( u(s) = s^3 \\\\) is introduced and added to \\\\( z(s) \\\\), and then \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied from \\\\( s_1 \\\\) to T, will the resulting \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) be influenced solely by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + i \\\\cdot t \\\\) and not by the introduction of \\\\( s^3 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( u(s) = s^3 \\\\) alters the function being integrated from time \\\\( s_1 \\\\) to T, affecting the results of the integral transformation, \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The final outcome \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) is therefore dependent on both the initial function and the intervention by \\\\( u(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
