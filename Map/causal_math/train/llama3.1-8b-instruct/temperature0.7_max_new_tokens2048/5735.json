  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output y(t) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial t} = Py(t) + Qu(t)\\\\), with P a differential operator and Q a control influence operator. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on the system's behavior, particularly focusing on the impact of control function u(t).\n\nIf a compensatory control adjustment \\\\(v(t)\\\\) is applied at a specific time point \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the control from u(t) to \\\\(u(t) + v(t)\\\\), will the transformed output \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(y(T))\\\\) at some T > t_1 solely depend on the original operator Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with v(t) introduces an additional control dynamic to the original system. Since both Q and v(t) affect the control path, the transformed output at time T is dependent on the interaction and cumulative effect of u(t), v(t), and the characteristics of Q, not merely on Q alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
