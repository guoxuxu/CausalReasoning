  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to an initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the oscillator’s behavior at a later time T be identical to if \\\\(x_0\\\\) were simply allowed to evolve naturally under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) initially modifies the amplitude of the oscillator. As time progresses, this change in initial amplitude differentially scales the solution to the oscillator's differential equation, resulting in a differently amplitude-modulated oscillation compared to the natural evolution of \\\\(x_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
