  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the properties of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f](s) \\\\) of this function, given for a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[e^{(z+p)^2}](s) \\\\) for some complex \\\\( s \\\\), can we conclusively identify that the modification involved the specific function \\\\( g(z) = e^{(z+p)^2} \\\\) as opposed to any other potential interventions?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformation result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[e^{(z+p)^2}](s) \\\\) is specific to the transformation and the value of \\\\( s \\\\), it does not uniquely distinguish between different potential modifications or interventions unless other specific information about the function form or the nature of the intervention is known, due to the general properties of the Laplace transform and the possible effects on complex functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
