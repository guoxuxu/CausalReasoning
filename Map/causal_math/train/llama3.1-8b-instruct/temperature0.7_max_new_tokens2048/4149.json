  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on \\( z(t) \\), defined by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ist}z(t) dt \\).\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\) is calculated without any modification to \\( z(t) \\), will the outcome at frequency \\( s \\) be solely dependent on the properties of matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) captures the frequency components inherent to the functions \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), which are solely governed by matrices A and B respectively. The outcome at any specific frequency \\( s \\) in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(s) \\) will directly reflect the characteristics of A and B as long as no modifications or interventions are applied to \\( z(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
