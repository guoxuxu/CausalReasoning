  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x, t)\\\\, dx \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolved under \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to t = T and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution of the wave equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\) remains consistent under evolution without intervention. This invariance results from the transformation accurately representing the wave dynamics in the frequency domain, where the shift in frequencies due to the wave equation directly mirrors transformation over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
