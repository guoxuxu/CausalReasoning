  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf at a specific moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\eta t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final result \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the initial linear equation settings, disregarding the effects of transformations \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adds a new layer of complexity to the signal's evolution, making the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) a result of not only the linear operator L but also influenced by the effects of both transformations (\\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)). These transformations affect how the signal evolves, leading to a final state that cannot be predicted solely from the initial linear configuration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
