  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nCan we deduce the amplitude \\\\(A\\\\) of the original sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\) from the steady-state output \\\\(y(t)\\\\), without any prior knowledge about \\\\(H(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the system's transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the scaling and phase alteration imparted by the system cannot be quantified, thus making it impossible to accurately determine the original amplitude \\\\(A\\\\) of the input signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
