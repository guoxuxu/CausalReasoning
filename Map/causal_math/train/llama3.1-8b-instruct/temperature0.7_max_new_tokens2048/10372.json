  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation through the integral \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the behavior when using two transformations: \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = \\\\sin(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the computed \\\\( H(s) \\\\) after interventions, can we determine which transformations (either \\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both) were applied to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexity of integral transformations and their sensitivity to the original function form and alterations thereof, different transformations can yield similar or indistinguishably overlapping results in \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without additional information, it is not feasible to uniquely discern which transformations were used just by analyzing \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
