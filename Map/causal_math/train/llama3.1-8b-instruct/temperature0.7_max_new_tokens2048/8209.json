  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given integral equation without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was directly used in the integral equation to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the input function, which in turn changes the behavior of the integral equation. The transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) will affect the integrand by potentially altering both magnitude and direction, leading to a different \\\\( y(T) \\\\) as compared to using the unmodified \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
