  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is subjected to an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\, dt \\), evaluating the Laplace transform of the function.\n\nAfter observing the Laplace transform \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T, can we unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) masks the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) through interaction with \\\\( s \\), making it infeasible to accurately deduce \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without specific knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\). The transform alters the frequency characteristics embedded in the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
