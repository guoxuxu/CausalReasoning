  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is another real constant, applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nBased on the final complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used, just by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of scaling factors \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), along with different values of \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can result in the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The final outcome does not uniquely specify which interventions were used, as various combinations could lead to indistinguishable results in magnitude and phase at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(z) → z(t); z_0 → z(t); ω → z(t); a → z(t); T → z(t); h(z) → z(T); a → z(T); ω → z(T); z_0 → z(T); T → z(T); h(z) → z_0 is not directly stated, but it can be inferred as z_0 is the initial state and h(z) is applied over time t."
