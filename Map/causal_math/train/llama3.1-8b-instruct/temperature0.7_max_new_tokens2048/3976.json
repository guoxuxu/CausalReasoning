  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(t\\\\) is real time variable. We study the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{is}ds * z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions or transformations were enacted (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\) or both), solely from knowing \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in how different transformations and integrations with \\\\(z\\\\) can affect the final state, compounded by the complexity added by each modification, make it indeterminate to uniquely identify the specific transformations or interventions from just \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
