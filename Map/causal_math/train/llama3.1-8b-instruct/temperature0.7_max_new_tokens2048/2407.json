  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing function transformations and boundary perturbations on the solution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf part of the boundary condition of \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) is perturbed at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), in a manner modifying the eigenvalues, will the final solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) not on the nature of the boundary perturbation?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary condition perturbation can lead to a shift in the eigenvalues and spectrum of the Laplacian, which impacts the solution structure. The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) becomes a function of the new boundary conditions, hence influenced by the perturbations alongside \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
