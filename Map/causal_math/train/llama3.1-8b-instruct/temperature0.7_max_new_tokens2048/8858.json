  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) with boundary conditions. We explore the system response under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) and consider the dynamics when impacted by an operation \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}\\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) in the transformed domain, can we uniquely determine the state \\\\( u(x, y, 0) \\\\) without knowing the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, allowing the recovery of \\\\( u(x, y, 0) \\\\) from its transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\). The initial conditions can be reconstructed exactly by applying the inverse Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
