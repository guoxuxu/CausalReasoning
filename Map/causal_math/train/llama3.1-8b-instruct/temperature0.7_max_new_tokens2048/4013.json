  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which is the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} \\\\), describing heat conduction. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) to analyze its behavior under different conditions.\n\nIf the initial condition of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace transform, and then \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) evolves following the specified PDE without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at some time T reflect solely the evolution of the initial conditions under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the PDE given initial conditions evolves deterministically under the heat equation's dynamics. The Laplace transform of this solution at time T will uniquely represent this evolution, following the properties of the Laplace transform in linear time-invariant systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
