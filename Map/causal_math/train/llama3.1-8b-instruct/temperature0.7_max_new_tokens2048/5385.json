  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The investigation involves examining the effects of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and its impact over the function transformation through \\\\\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then let to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace Transform at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly computed without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) alters the initial function, resulting in \\\\( z(t) = e^{at}z_{0}(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z_{0}(t) \\\\) is the original function. This modification changes the frequency and decay rate of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus affecting its Laplace Transform by adding a pole shift, so \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of the transformed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) won't match the original one directly without transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
