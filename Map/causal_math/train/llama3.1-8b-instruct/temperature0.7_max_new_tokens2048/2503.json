  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(z) = z + c \\) (where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the output \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\) depend solely on the original function \\( f \\) and not on the transformations \\( g \\) or \\( h \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions \\( g(z) = z^s \\) and \\( h(z) = z + c \\) introduce new dynamics to the input of \\( f \\). The addition and exponentiation manipulate the base input \\( z_0 \\) in ways that significantly alter the result of \\( f \\), rendering the output dependent on all applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
