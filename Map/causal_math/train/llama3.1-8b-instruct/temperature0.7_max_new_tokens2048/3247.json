  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. This function models a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane over time t. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function and then examining the implications of manipulations in the frequency domain.\n\nIf we alter the Fourier domain representation by filtering out all frequencies except \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and then apply an inverse Fourier transform, will the resulting function still represent \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly as the original?",
  "Explanation": "Filtering to retain only the \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) component and then performing an inverse Fourier transform ideally reconstructs the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), assuming no loss or alteration occurs in the process of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
