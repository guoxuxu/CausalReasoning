  "Problem": "Consider a partially observable system where the state at time t, denoted by \\\\( x(t) \\\\), evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx(t) = Cx(t) dt + dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the noise in the system. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific sequence and type of interventions (\\\\( h(x) \\\\) or \\\\( m(x) \\\\), or both) be uniquely determined by observing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may result from multiple potential sequences of transformations due to the overlapping effects of matrices \\\\( D, E \\\\) and system dynamics \\\\( C \\\\), as well as the intrinsic noise. This overlap makes it impossible to accurately distinguish which interventions were precisely used, especially without additional information or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
