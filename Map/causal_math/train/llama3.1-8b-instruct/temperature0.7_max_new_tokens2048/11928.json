  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We are interested in understanding how the integral transforms, specifically the Laplace transform, affect this function and its causal inference.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then invert the transform, will the resulting function be identical to the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) across the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the domain of the function from the time (or real) domain to the complex frequency domain. While the inverse Laplace transform is designed to retrieve the original function, issues such as convergence and the region of absolute convergence of the original function can affect whether the original function is perfectly reconstructed across the entire complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
