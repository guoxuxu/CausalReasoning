  "Problem": "Consider the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) in a flat, thin rod over time \\\\(t\\\\), governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity of the rod material. We investigate the impact of a change in boundary conditions defined by the step-function \\\\(\\\\phi(x) = T \\\\) (constant temperature) applied at one end of the rod.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely determine which boundary conditions were in effect or when they were applied (whether \\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\psi(x)\\\\), or both), by just knowing the temperature distribution at \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Temperature distribution alone at a single time point such as \\\\(T\\\\) especially after multiple interventions cannot precisely indicate which conditions were applied or their timing. Various combinations of timing and temperature settings could lead to similar distributions at \\\\(T\\\\), making it ambiguous without more detailed time-series data or initial knowledge.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
