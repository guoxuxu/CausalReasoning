  "Problem": "Investigate a heat distribution system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\(k\\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial temperature distribution function, \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) is applied as the initial condition and left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at any time t > 0 be the same as if \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was directly used initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) as the initial condition alters the frequency components of the initial temperature profile, thus changing how heat diffuses through the system over time. This initial change results in a different temperature distribution compared to using the original \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
