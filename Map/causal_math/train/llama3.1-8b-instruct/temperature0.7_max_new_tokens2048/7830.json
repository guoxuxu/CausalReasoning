  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied, it's difficult to uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution, as the transformation into the frequency domain may alter characteristics that are not recoverable uniquely after evolution, especially if there was any information loss or practical alteration like numerical computation impacts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
