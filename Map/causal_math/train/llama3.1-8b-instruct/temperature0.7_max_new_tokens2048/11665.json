  "Problem": "Consider a heat distribution on a metal rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents the temperature at point x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. Assess the effect of a heat source represented by a function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) added at specific points over time.\n\nIf heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is applied at a particular point at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the given PDE without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at T > 0 be solely determined by the initial conditions and the PDE, unaffected by \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at the initial time modifies the system's state initially and influences the temperature distribution over time, deviating from what would be determined by the initial distribution alone. The effects of \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) propagate through the rod affecting the heat distribution at any subsequent time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
