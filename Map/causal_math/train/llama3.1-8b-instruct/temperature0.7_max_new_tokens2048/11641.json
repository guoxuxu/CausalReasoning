  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and subsequently allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T compare identically to the trajectory of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved without the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) alters the initial condition, affecting the trajectory uniquely. The exponential growth factor changes both magnitude and direction depending on \\\\( A \\\\), hence leading to a different trajectory from what would result from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under natural dynamics alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
