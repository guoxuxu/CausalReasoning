  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves in time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We scrutinize the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant, and observe the causal relationships and system dynamics.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( U(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 not depend on the initial transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\( U(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the subsequent trajectory to be shaped by factors \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) along with \\\\( a \\\\). The path will reflect a compound impact given by \\\\( e^{aT}e^{b t_1}e^{c(T-t_1)}z_0 \\\\), showing dependence on initial as well as intervention transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
