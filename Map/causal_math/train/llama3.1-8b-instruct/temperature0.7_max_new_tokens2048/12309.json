  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) evolved under the differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant. Investigations include the effect of executing a transformation given by the integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\), with \\( s \\) being a complex parameter.\n\nFrom observing \\( z(T) \\) at some time T, can one deduce exactly what the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) at t=0 was, assuming no intervention other than the complex differential system \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex dynamics governed by \\( z^2 + c \\) significantly modulate \\( z \\)'s trajectory, making it non-trivial to reverse-engineer or accurately determine the original function \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) solely based on final observations at \\( z(T) \\) without explicit knowledge of all intermediate transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
