  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and then analyzing the resultant complex function.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to obtain \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) evolves under a defined complex function transformation without further intervention, can \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after transformation reveal the precise causal effect of the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform inherently alters the representation from time domain to complex frequency domain. After applying any subsequent transformation to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without reverting, causal tracing to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) becomes obscured due to the transformation's potential to modify the complex frequency characteristics significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
