  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The integral transformation maps the time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different complex values of \\\\( s \\\\) is of interest.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z * e^{bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied at a point during the transformation process, will the final form of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) be influenced only by the combined parameters of \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) effectively changes the functional form that is being transformed. Consequently, the final function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is recalculated with the modified \\\\( z(t) = z(t) * e^{bt} \\\\), making the result dependent on \\\\( s \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and now also \\\\( b \\\\). The causality flows through these parameters without external factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
