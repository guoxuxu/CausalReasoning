  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined in a closed path in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are differentiable functions of t. The transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Tz = z^2 \\\\), applied to the path of z.\n\nGiven the final path at t = T, can one precisely determine both the original path and whether both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) were applied, solely based on the knowledge of the final path?",
  "Explanation": "The complex square and the translation transformations can lead to multiple original paths that could have reached the same final path under differing applications of \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\). The non-linearity and the degrees of freedom in choosing c make it impossible to uniquely determine all initial conditions and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
