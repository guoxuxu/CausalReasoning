  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex vector. We explore how the system evolves under the operation of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely determined from the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the details of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The precise original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be fully recovered without knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\) due to the dependence of the transformed state on the characteristics and eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
