  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real constant and t is time. We will analyze scenarios pertaining to a Laplace transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z(t)](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iA} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the value of A?",
  "Explanation": "From the transform result \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - iA} \\\\), it is clear that A can be uniquely determined as A is the imaginary component of the pole s. The relationship is direct and permits retrieval of the original parameter A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
