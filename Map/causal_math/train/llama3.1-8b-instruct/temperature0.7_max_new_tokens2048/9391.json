  "Problem": "Imagine a complex system described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{Ct} z dt \\\\) on the behavior of the system over time T.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a second transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on C and not on D or the effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interaction of the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) which integrates the transformation over time, and the later applied \\\\( h(z) \\\\), means that the final state at T is influenced by both C and D. The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is the product of these compounded effects, diverging from what C alone would produce.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
