  "Problem": "Analyze the feedback system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another constant matrix, applied at specific instances.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then letting the system evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which affects the system’s subsequent evolution. Since \\\\( K \\\\) changes the starting point, the trajectory under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) will diverge from that starting from the unmodified \\\\( x_0 \\\\), leading to a generally different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
