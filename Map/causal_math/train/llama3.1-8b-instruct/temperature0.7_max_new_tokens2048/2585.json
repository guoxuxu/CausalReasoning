  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed for z(t) from t = 0 to T, and the function z(t) is allowed to evolve naturally without intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at later times be the same as the case where no integral transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from t = 0 to T does not alter the functional form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The function continues to evolve accordingly to its original definition, independent of the integral computed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
