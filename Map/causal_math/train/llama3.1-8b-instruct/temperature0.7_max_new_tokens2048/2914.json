  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( F(a)(x) = \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\)) based solely on the transformed result and assuming no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) uniquely results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\) in the Fourier transform setting, we can uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) from its transformation, assuming no intervention altered \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
