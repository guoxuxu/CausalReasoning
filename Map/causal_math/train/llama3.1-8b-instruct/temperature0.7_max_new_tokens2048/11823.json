  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear time-invariant system characterized by an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The output of the system \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution \\\\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\\\). We then apply a Fourier transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Y(f) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed output in the frequency domain, \\\\( Z(f) \\\\), can we determine the exact form of the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the characteristics of both the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output \\\\( Z(f) = G(f)X(f)H(f) \\\\) provides limited information. Without knowing the specifics of one of the contributing components, there could be multiple potential solutions for \\\\( G(f) \\\\), \\\\( X(f) \\\\), and \\\\( H(f) \\\\) that would satisfy the equation for \\\\( Z(f) \\\\). The multiplicative relationships in the frequency domain mean that various combinations of the three components could produce the same \\\\( Z(f) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
