  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The intervention is introduced by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied at a specific time.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we distinctly identify whether interventions like \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied, based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely define the sequence or nature of interventions due to the potential overlapping influences of matrix exponentiation transformations. Distinct pathways might lead to the same endpoint, especially when different matrices interact, creating indistinguishable outcomes despite varied intervention histories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
