  "Problem": "Examine the effect of performing a Laplace transform on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). Suppose an inverse Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to yield \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We then analyze whether the transformations preserve certain properties of the original function over time.\n\nSuppose a non-linear transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) is applied to the function before the Laplace transform. After reconstructing the function post inverse Laplace transform, will the resulting function reflect the dynamics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The non-linear transformation modifies the original function significantly. The resultant post inverse transform of the Laplace-transformed \\\\( h(t) \\\\) will reflect the dynamics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and not just \\\\( f(t) \\\\), thus altering the nature of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "non-linear transformation → h(t); Laplace transform → F(s); Inverse Laplace transform → g(t); h(t) → F(s); F(s) → g(t); f(t) → h(t); f(t) → F(s); h(t) → g(t); F(s) → h(s) is not a valid relation, F(s) is a function of s, not t; f(t) → g(t) is a complex relation that involves multiple steps and is not a direct causal link."
