  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the variable z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant, and i is the imaginary unit. The transformation is defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{-Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is also a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the starting point of the system, altering its trajectory. The function \\\\( e^{-Bt} \\\\) changes the magnitude and potentially phases of the initial vector, leading to differences in system evolution when subjected to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
