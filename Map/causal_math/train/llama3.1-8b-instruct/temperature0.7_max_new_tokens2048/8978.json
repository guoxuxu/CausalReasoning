  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) evolved under \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\) without knowing about any transformation, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of stochastic integral \\\\( dB_t \\\\) introduces randomness into the system, making it impossible to accurately backtrack the exact initial state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) due solely to the information at time T, particularly without explicit knowledge of applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
