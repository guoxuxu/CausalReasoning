  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a wave propagating in space and time. We analyze this system after performing a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) after various possible interventions (like filtering), can we determine precisely which intervention (or combination thereof) was applied, based solely on the value of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of different transformations in the frequency domain can overlap or mask each other, making it non-trivial and typically impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were applied, solely based on the outcome state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
