  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), applied to this function over variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), for all \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\), and the Laplace transform is applied thereafter, will the resulting transform function be independent of the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification changes the behavior of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\), resulting in a piecewise function whose transform depends both on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) before \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and the adjusted \\\\( \\omega + \\delta \\\\) after. Therefore, the transform will reflect characteristics of both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
