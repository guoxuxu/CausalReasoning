  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic functional integral equation system governed by \\\\(I(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\\\). We examine the effects of applying the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\).\n\nSuppose an additional transformation, the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(I)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-sx} dx\\\\), is applied at a certain time. Will the resultant function depend only on the analytical properties of I(x) and not on the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "While I(x) directly influences both transforms, the application of the Laplace transform after the Fourier transform could suggest dependencies or comparative analysis between the two transformations' results. Consequently, the resultant functions' analytical properties may reflect combined or comparative influences of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
