  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). We explore the effect of a convolution operation where \\\\( g(t) = f(t) * h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another time-domain function and the corresponding Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) after modifications by the damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we accurately determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or the nature of the intervention (the value \\\\( a \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and different values of \\\\( a \\\\) could yield the same modified Laplace transform, \\\\( G(s) \\\\). Estimating \\\\( a \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without additional information introduces ambiguities, making it impossible to uniquely identify the original function or intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
