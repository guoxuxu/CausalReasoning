  "Problem": "Consider the impact of two different integral transforms on a function h(t), one being the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and the other being the Fourier Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). These transformations are applied to h(t) to evaluate their influences and potentially infer properties of h(t) from their transformations. The function \\( h(t) = e^{-kt} \\) for \\( k > 0 \\).\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} \\) is computed for h(t), will this transform yield information that is equivalent to directly computing the Fourier Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} \\) without further transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform and the Fourier Transform, although related, are fundamentally different in their domains and the information they capture about a function. The Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s+k} \\) focuses on complex frequency s, while the Fourier Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-kt} e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\) emphasizes real frequency \\( \\\\omega \\). These transforms encapsulate different aspects of the function h(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
