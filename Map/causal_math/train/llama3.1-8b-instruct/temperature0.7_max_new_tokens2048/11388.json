  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-zt} dz \\\\). Let \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real positive parameter.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) of the integral transformation at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether an intervention was applied at \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the application of an intervention solely based on the output at \\\\( T \\\\) is ambiguous. The nature of exponential and polynomial factors in complex integrals can cause similar forms of \\\\( y(T) \\\\) to arise from different intervened or non-intervened functions. Thus, without additional information about the trajectory over time or changes in function form, the presence of an intervention cannot be conclusively identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
