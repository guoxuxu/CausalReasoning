  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(e^{kx}x(t)) = X(s-k)\\), can we unequivocally determine the original function \\(x(t)\\) without knowing \\(k\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\(k\\), it is impossible to allocate the observed shifts in the Laplace domain uniquely to alterations originally in \\(x(t)\\) or due to \\(e^{kx}\\). \\(k\\) directly influences the shift and without it, back-calculating \\(x(t)\\) is indeterminable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
