  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\Delta u\\\\) governs the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) over a domain, with constant thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\). We investigate the impact of a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), and analyze its influence on temperature evolution.\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution at \\\\(t = T\\\\) after certain unknown transformations and interventions, can we determine exactly how \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was transformed or what interventions were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations or different types of interventions (like varying heat sources) can lead to similar or identical temperature distributions at \\\\(t = T\\\\). Without explicit information about the nature and timing of these interventions, reconstructing the exact sequence of events or transformations is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
