  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input that can be transformed using an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{F(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of a new input function. We study how transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affect the system's behavior.\n\nIf a transformed control input \\\\( u'(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) is set at t = 0 such that \\\\( G(s) \\\\neq F(s) \\\\), and then the system is left to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu' \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at some future time t = T be the same as if original control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of the input changes the control function applied to the system, affecting the entire trajectory from the initial state. Since \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) differs from \\\\( u(t) \\\\), even if both are bounded and stable, they lead to different state responses due to the properties of the system dynamics described by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
