  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by an integral transformation using Laplace Transform with \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We focus on the consequences of modifying this system through a convolution with the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and the corresponding transformation in the Laplace domain is \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the start, and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s \\\\) domain be equivalent to directly applying its Laplace transform to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without convolving with \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the original system by modifying the input. In the Laplace domain, this corresponds to a multiplication, \\\\( Y(s)*H(s) \\\\), which inherently alters the characteristics of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) compared to an unaltered transformation directly from \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
