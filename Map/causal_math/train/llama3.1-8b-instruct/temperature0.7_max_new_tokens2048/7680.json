  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nGiven the frequency domain data after applying scaling transformation and Fourier transformation, can we determine the exact time \\\\(t_1\\\\) at which the intervention \\\\(g(t) = e^{\\alpha t}\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The information on the exact time of intervention \\\\(t_1\\\\) does not manifest distinctively in the frequency domain data. The Fourier transform predominantly captures frequency content, and the influence of \\\\(t_1\\\\) on the amplitude scaling blends universally across the time domain being analyzed, rendering \\\\(t_1\\\\) indeterminate from the frequency spectrum alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
