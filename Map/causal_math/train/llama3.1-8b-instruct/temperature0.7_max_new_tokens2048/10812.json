  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by complex function theory, where \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a given function. Assess how transformations by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which acts on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) as \\\\( L[f(x)] = f(ax+b) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, affect the outcome in terms of the causality and intervention.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( z(w) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely whether the original function was altered by \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both, only by observing the final transformed integral?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome of the integral, \\\\( z(w) \\\\), may not distinctly reflect the sequence or type of transformations applied (operator \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)). This ambiguity arises because the alterations in the function due to linear transformations might produce integral results that feasibly correspond to multiple potential transformation pathways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
