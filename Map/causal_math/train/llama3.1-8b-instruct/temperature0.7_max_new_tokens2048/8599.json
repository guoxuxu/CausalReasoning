  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation given by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. We explore the effect of an integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\).\n\nIf a compensatory term \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) modeled by another differential equation is introduced at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the original Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 dictate the evolution of the system at times t > t_1 completely?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional term \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) significantly alters the system dynamics, making the evolution dependent not only on the initial Fourier transform but also on the effects and interactions introduced by \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\). This changes the subsequent evolution and state at time t > t_1.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
