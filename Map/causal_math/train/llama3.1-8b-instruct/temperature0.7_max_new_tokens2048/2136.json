  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = F(x, y) \\\\) that maps complex numbers \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( F(x, y) = x^2 + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( F \\\\) and its derivatives across transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(x, y) = (e^{Ax}x, e^{By}y) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants.\n\nKnowing the final transformed version of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations or variables were manipulated through \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) or if other transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interactions and transformations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) by exponential functions, multiple different transformations could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The non-linear dependencies and possible multiple solutions to the equations involved render it impossible to determine from the endpoint alone what specific interventions or transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
