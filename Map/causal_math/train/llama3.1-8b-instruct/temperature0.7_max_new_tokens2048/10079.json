  "Problem": "Consider a control system formulated by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control vector. The study considers the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), applied at certain intervals, where M is a distinct constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) as an intervention function introduces additional factors that influence the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The final state depends not only on D but also on how N and M have individually or jointly influenced the dynamics of the system post-transformation, affecting the trajectory and resulting state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
