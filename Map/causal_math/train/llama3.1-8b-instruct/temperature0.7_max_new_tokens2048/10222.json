  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty on whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the initial state. The modifications induced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could drastically alter the initial real and imaginary components, obfuscating their original values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
