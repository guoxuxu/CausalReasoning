  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and B is the control input matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation of the states defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a control input \\\\( u(t) = v \\\\) (a constant vector) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied at time 0, will the system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and not on the transformation M?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) would be affected both by the matrix D due to the natural evolution of the system and the control input Bv, as well as by the implications of the initial transformation by M. The roles of both D and M are significant in defining the system's path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
