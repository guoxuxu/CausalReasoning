  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\) acting on a complex function \\( x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We examine the consequences of applying an Integral transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an additional unitary transformation \\( u(t) = e^{-i\\eta t}x(t) \\) (where \\( \\eta \\) is a new constant frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) for t > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original transformation \\( z(t) \\) irrespective of \\( u(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( u(t) \\) alters the state again, adding another frequency component \\( -i\\eta \\). Even if \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) was established prior to \\( t_1 \\), the subsequent state will reflect the compounding effect of the two transformations, affecting the output in a manner dependent on both \\( \\eta \\) and \\( \\omega \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
