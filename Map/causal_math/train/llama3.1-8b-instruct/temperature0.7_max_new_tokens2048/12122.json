  "Problem": "Assume a process where a complex function \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) undergoes a transformation under a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which acts as \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants in the complex plane. Consider the effect of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( m(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_2 \\\\)) depend on the specific values of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), influence aside from the primary operator \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the value of \\\\( B \\\\) (from the transformation \\\\( L \\\\)) and \\\\( D \\\\) (from the intervention \\\\( m(z) \\\\)) will affect the final outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\). These transformations impact the state of the system at different stages, leading to compounded effects that are dependent on the specifics of all involved constants.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
