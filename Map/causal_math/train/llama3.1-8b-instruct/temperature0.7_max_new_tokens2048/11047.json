  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) in terms of time \\( t \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0 \\), where \\( \\zeta \\) is the damping ratio and \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the natural frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform and its inverse under different scenarios.\n\nIf an external force \\( f(t) \\) described by a Dirac delta function is applied at a specific time, and then the system's response is analyzed using the Laplace Transform, will the transformed output depend solely on the original parameters \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\) without influence from the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the external force \\( f(t) \\) influences the system's response. The Laplace Transform of the resulting system will include terms representing the intervention, thus altering the purely natural response dictated by \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\). The system's transformed response will reflect both the natural characteristics and the effect of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
