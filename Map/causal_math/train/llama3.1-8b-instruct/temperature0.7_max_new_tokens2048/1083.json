  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number initially at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\. Over time, the function describes a circular trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a scaling operation defined by a constant positive real number \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = se^{iAt}x \\\\. For \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\. will the magnitude of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) now depend only on the scaling factor \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or the initial \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the scaling factor \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the magnitude directly and is a predominant factor, the resulting magnitude of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still depends on the initial magnitude of \\\\( x \\\\. The scaling does not negate the inherent properties of \\\\( x \\\\) such as its initial magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
