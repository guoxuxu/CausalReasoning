  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions describing the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. We are concerned with how these components transform under the operation \\\\(w(t) = e^{kt}z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) from \\\\(w(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstruction of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(w(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) requires knowledge about the transformation specifics, i.e., the value of \\\\(k\\\\). Without knowing whether and how the transformation \\\\(e^{kt}\\\\) was applied, multiple possible original functions could correspond to the same observed state at \\\\(T\\\\), given the variable effects of scaling and rotation implicit in the transformation.",
