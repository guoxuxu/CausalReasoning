  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, capacitor, and resistor (LCR circuit) where its behavior is described by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). An external voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{st}\\\\) is considered as a function transformation applying to the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an additional voltage source \\\\(V'(t) = V'_0 e^{rt}\\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the current \\\\(i(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the additional voltage source \\\\(V'(t)\\\\) superposes a new dynamic to the circuit, affecting the total circuit response and thereby the current \\\\(i(T)\\\\) at time T, reflecting the influence of both voltage sources.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
