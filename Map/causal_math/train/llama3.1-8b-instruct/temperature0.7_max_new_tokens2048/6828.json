  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. To analyze this scenario, we apply an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) at different times.\n\nAfter observing the transformation output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and knowing an intervention changed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we ascertain whether the intervention occurred before or after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone does not provide information about the timing of the intervention related to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) integrates over the function potentially both before and after the intervention, it can encompass effects from both the original and altered parameters, making it unclear when the intervention occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
