  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional linear dynamical system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with M being a 2x2 constant matrix. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another 2x2 constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then left to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), which changes the trajectory of the system. The resultant evolution from \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) can lead to a state that is fundamentally different from that obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the same differential equation due to the influence of D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
