  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nSeeing the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), is it possible to determine accurately what transformations (either \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\), \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), or both) were applied during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) can result from various possible combinations and timings of applying \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\). The overlapping and non-commutative effects of exponential matrix transformations on the evolving function make it impossible to uniquely back-calculate all interventions based solely on the final observation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
