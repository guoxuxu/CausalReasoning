  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. This scenario examines the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\), with \\\\( P \\\\) being another constant complex matrix, on the system's evolution over time.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = Qz \\\\) (where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( P \\\\) and only dependent on \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from composite effects of transformations and matrix exponentials. Both the initial transformation by \\\\( P \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( Q \\\\) contribute to the state's evolution, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
