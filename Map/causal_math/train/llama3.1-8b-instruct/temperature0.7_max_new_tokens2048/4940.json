  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model for population growth under limited resources, described by the logistic differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dp}{dt} = rp(1 - \\\\frac{p}{K})\\\\), where \\\\(p\\\\) is the population, \\\\(r\\\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\\\(K\\\\) is the carrying capacity. We explore the impact of a harvesting rate represented by a function \\\\(h(p) = Hp\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant, that could be applied to the population over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(p(T)\\\\), can we determine exactly what harvesting interventions were used (whether \\\\(h(p) = Hp\\\\), \\\\(h(p) = Gp\\\\), or both), solely by knowing the population at \\\\(p(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same population endpoint \\\\(p(T)\\\\) could potentially result from different combinations or timings of harvesting due to the complexity of interactions between harvesting rates and logistic growth. Without additional information about the timing and sizes of interventions, it is impossible to precisely deduce the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
