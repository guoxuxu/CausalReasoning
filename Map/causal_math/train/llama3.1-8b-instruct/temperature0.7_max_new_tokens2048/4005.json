  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az + B} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants. The model investigates the impact of the linear transformation and the complex function on a vector space over a field of complex numbers.\n\nIf a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( v \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to each component without further modification, will the outcome be equal to directly applying a transformation \\\\( f(Mv) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operations of matrix multiplication and function application don't generally commute. While \\\\( Mv \\\\) alters the vector in the space, applying \\\\( f \\\\) component-wise after \\\\( M \\\\) could differ from applying \\\\( f \\\\) directly to \\\\( Mv \\\\), due to the properties of the exponential function and its dependence on the linear transformation by \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
