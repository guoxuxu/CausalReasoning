  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in two-dimensional space over time. We analyze how the system behaves under the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another complex constant) is applied at t = t_1, will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the dynamics defined initially and not on the transformations introduced by A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = t_1 modifies the trajectory in a compounded manner with the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), resulting in a final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) that depends on both A and B. The effects of A and B accumulate, influencing the trajectory and consequently the final state in a way that is not solely dictated by natural dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
