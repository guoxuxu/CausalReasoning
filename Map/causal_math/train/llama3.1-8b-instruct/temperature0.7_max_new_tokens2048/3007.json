  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing physical quantities in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t t^2 z(s) ds \\\\) is applied to the system as an intervention, will the system's output at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be determined solely by the LTI system's characteristics and not by the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U[z] \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional alteration to the system state, making the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on the effects of both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) as well as the inherent properties of the LTI system. Each transformation impacts the evolution of the system in potentially complex ways, depending on their integrals' nature and operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
