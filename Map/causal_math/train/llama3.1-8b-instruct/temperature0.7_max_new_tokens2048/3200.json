  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, often represented as \\\\( a = b + ci \\\\). We examine how the function responds to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and we analyze situations both with and without interventions defined by multiplying by another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - (b+ c + d)} \\\\) after the application of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we precisely disentangle and identify the values of \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\) independently?",
  "Explanation": "The similar mathematical roles of \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\) in the sum within the Laplace transform mean that without additional information about the magnitude or nature of these parameters, they cannot be uniquely or independently identified. Their effects are combined, making disentanglement based solely on the transformed result impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
