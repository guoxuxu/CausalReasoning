  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the matrix function \\\\( M(t) = P e^{Qt} \\\\), where P is a constant matrix and Q is a diagonal matrix. The system's evolution is analyzed under a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Lx \\\\) followed by a temporal evolution described by \\\\( M(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely the interventions used (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) based on the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone, given the knowledge of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), multiple combinations of initial transformations and interventions can lead to the same final state due to the potential non-uniqueness of matrix operations and their compositions in altering trajectories. Labeling which transformations were applied is inherently ambiguous without more information on interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
