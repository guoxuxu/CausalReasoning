  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) defined on a complex domain, and a transformation h(z) where \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\). We analyze the effect of applying this transformation to various complex numbers and observing the results over the domain.\n\nGiven the result f(z) for some z, can we determine whether h(z) was applied to find the original input to f(z) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether h(z) was applied, it is difficult to deduce the original z from f(z) alone because squaring a complex number (as done by h(z)) does not have a unique inverse - there could be multiple candidates for z that, when squared, give the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(z) → h(z); h(z) → z; z → f(z); h(z) → z^2; z → z^2; z^2 → f(z)"
