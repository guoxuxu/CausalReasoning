  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, acting on the time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). We examine the effect of Fourier Transform on \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and explore how these transformations influence causal relationships.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional exponential modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention on \\\\( y(t) \\\\), will the subsequent Fourier Transform of the result show that the original frequency content of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) remains unaltered?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the exponential modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) which counters the effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{-i\\omega t} \\\\) effectively demodulates the signal back to its original frequency content. The Fourier Transform then will display the original spectrum of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without any shift, as the modulations cancel each other out.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
