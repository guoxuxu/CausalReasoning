  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can the specific interventions (whether \\( h(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) be distinctly identified by just observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential for overlapping effects due to the non-commutative nature of matrix multiplication and exponential interaction means conversions \\( e^{Bt} \\) and \\( e^{Ct} \\) could yield similar results in combination with \\( e^{At} \\). Different combinations of \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) could potentially lead to the same final state \\( z(T) \\), hence the applied interventions can't be uniquely deduced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
