  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at time t, transforming the system's state.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impractical without additional information. The transformations due to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) generate a spectrum of possible states, each achievable through different potential paths or intervention sequences, further complicated by the matrix exponential properties in the complex domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
