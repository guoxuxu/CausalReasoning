  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\\\), with \\\\(c\\\\) being a constant complex number. Study the behavior of this system under the integral transformation \\\\(T_c(z) = \\\\int_0^t (z(s) + c) \\\\, ds\\\\), focusing on how \\\\(c\\\\) influences the trajectory.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation, \\\\(S_d(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} (z(s) + d) \\\\, ds\\\\) (where \\\\(d\\\\) is another constant complex number), is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend on both \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, the inclusion of another transformation with a different constant \\\\(d\\\\) affects the evolution and thus makes the final state at \\\\(T\\\\) dependent not only on the initial condition and \\\\(c\\\\) but also on the intervention with \\\\(d\\\\). The transformations might combine in a non-linear and complex manner, especially in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
