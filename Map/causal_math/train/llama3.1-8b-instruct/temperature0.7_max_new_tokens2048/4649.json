  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) representing a controlled input.\n\nDoes modifying the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from its initial function to a different continuous function \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) affect the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) if no other intervention is performed?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) directly depends on the input function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) via an integral transformation. Changing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) alters this integral, thus affecting the output at any time \\\\( T \\\\). The linearity and dependency on the input are explicit in the integral's operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
