  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyze how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + h \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant, will the final Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the initial parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( h \\\\) alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such that the resulting function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward incorporates this shift in both the system's trajectory and its Laplace transform. This change impacts the whole behavior, making the final transform dependent not just on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
