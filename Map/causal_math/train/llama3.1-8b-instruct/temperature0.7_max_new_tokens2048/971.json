  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a new transformation \\\\( S(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants), will the final state of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\) irrespective of \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional changes to the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which in turn affects \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The composite impact of both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), along with their potential non-commutativity, influences the subsequent trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) up to time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
