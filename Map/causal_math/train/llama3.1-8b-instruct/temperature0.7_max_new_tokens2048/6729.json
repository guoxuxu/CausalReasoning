  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant diffusivity. The rod undergoes a transformation due to a boundary condition change represented by \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at one end, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is set at t = 0, and allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T be equivalent to if \\\\( u(0,t) \\\\) wasn't changed?",
  "Explanation": "The new boundary condition modifies the initial state and influences how the heat diffuses along the rod. The exponential growth at one end results in a different temperature profile along the rod at any later time, compared to the default conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
