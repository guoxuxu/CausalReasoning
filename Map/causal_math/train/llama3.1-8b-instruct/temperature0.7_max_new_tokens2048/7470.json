  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf the frequency component at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is observed in the Fourier transform, can we conclude that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was generated only by \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in the Fourier transform does not uniquely imply that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was exclusively \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Other functions or a combination of periodic functions might also contribute to this frequency component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
