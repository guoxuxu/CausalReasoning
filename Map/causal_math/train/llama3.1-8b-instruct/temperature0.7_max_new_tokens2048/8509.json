  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to form \\\\( y'(t) \\\\), then is the transformed Laplace \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) simply the product of the original Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), noting \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a convolution equals the product of the individual Laplace transforms. Thus, \\\\( Y'(s) = Y(s)H(s) \\\\), directly correlating the transformation in the Laplace domain as a multiplication by \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
