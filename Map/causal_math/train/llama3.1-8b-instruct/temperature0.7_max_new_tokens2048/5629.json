  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) in the context of a mapping from the complex plane to itself. We explore the effect of computing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) \\\\) of this function, where the Fourier transform is defined in the integral form as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-2\\\\pi i z \\\\xi} dz \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then its Fourier transform is computed without modifying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\) remain the same irrespective of the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is highly dependent on the input complex number due to the exponential nature of the function. Changes in the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) will significantly alter the resultant transform due to the integral's dependency on \\\\( e^{z} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
