  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\), where U is a matrix that diagonalizes D (i.e., \\\\( UDU^{-1} = D' \\\\) is a diagonal matrix).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, without specific knowledge of whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was indeed applied but not accounted for, we might mistakenly assume the initial condition was \\\\( x_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( U^{-1}x_0 \\\\). Thus, without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely determine the initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
