  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nWithout knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, can we reverse engineer the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely by observing the output at time \\\\( t \\\\), \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If it is not known whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the alterations introduced by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could significantly modify the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\), rendering it infeasible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
