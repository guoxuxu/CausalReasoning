  "Problem": "Consider a hypothetical physical system where the state of the system \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the influence of changing the basis of the state vector using the transformation \\\\( T(x) = Px \\\\), where P is a matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), the overlapping potential effects of P and Q through their respective changes of basis make it impossible to distinctly identify whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both were applied. Their non-commutative nature with each other and potentially with D results in a complex trajectory that does not uniquely encode the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
