  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(w) \\\\) be a complex function defined as \\\\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\\\), mapped over the complex plane. We are interested in examining the changes in the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed contour in the w-plane, particularly under the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\).\n\nAfter computing the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C z(w) dw \\\\) for a transformed contour, can we infer the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) precisely without knowledge whether transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\\\) could significantly alter the original contour, distinguishing between the original and transformed contours merely from the integral value is generally not possible without knowing whether the transformation was applied. Any transformation effects inherently modify the original path in potentially irreversible ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
