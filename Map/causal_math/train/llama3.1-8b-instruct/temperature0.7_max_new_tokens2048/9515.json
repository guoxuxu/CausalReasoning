  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a differential modification \\\\( Cz \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the transformed endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) be unaffected by the nature of \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( Cz \\\\) modifies the differential equation affecting \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The integral transformation \\\\( F \\\\) subsequently accumulates these effects throughout the domain up to T. Therefore, the endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) will reflect changes induced by both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), alongside the original constant \\\\( A \\\\), leading to a different outcome depending on the interplay between these constants.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
