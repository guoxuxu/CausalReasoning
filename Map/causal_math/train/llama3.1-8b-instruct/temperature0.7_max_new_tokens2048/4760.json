  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\), where D is the Laplacian operator. Analyze the influence of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven that the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is observed, can we definitively identify whether an Inverse Fourier Transform intervention occurred, without ambiguity from possible other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention sequences (including combinations of transformations like Fourier and its inverse) can lead to the same observed endpoint. The non-uniqueness of the influences from these transformations, particularly when compounded, creates inherent uncertainty in tracing back exactly which interventions occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
