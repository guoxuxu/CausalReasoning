  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an inverse Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) is applied as an intervention, and then further transformations are applied, will the voltage distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the differential equation and not on the initial or intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) will be influenced by any transformations applied throughout the process, including the initial Fourier transform and any subsequent interventions like the inverse Fourier transformation at \\\\(t_1\\\\). These transformations alter the state of the system, which affects how the differential equation governs its further evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
