  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nIf at \\( x = 2 \\), we apply an intervention \\( h(x) = x - 1 \\) (transforming \\( x' = 1 \\)), will the resulting \\( y \\) at \\( x' = 1 \\) still be based solely on the initial function without considering the implications of \\( g(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening in the system by applying \\( h(x) = x - 1 \\) changes the trajectory and final outcome of y. Although \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) uniquely determines y from x, any preceding transformations (like \\( g(x) \\)) or their absence are pertinent, as they set up the conditions under which \\( h(x) \\) modifies x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
