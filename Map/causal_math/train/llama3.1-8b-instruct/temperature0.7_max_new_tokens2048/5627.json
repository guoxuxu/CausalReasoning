  "Problem": "Analyze a controlled system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_{t} + cu_{x} = 0\\\\), where c is a constant speed of wave propagation. A transformation is considered, defined by \\\\( g(u) = U(x,t) \\\\) where U is an integrating factor related to u, potentially altering the system dynamics.\n\nIf an intervention involving a new function \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\), where D is a constant matrix, is applied at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the path of \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) depend strictly on the original PDE and not on the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the intervention \\\\( h(u) \\\\) further complicates the system's evolution, making the final state \\\\( U(x,T) \\\\) dependent on the nature and effects of both \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\) alongside the original PDE. The alterations induced by each transformation will influence the outcomes at t = T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
