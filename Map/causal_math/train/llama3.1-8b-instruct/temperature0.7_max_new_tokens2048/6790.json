  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance \\\\(Z(s) = sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are the inductance and capacitance, respectively. The circuit's response to a voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is modeled by the transfer function \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}}\\\\). We examine the application of the Laplace Transform and its inverse to analyze the time domain and frequency domain behaviors.\n\nGiven a recorded current response \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the time domain from a known voltage input, can the original function \\\\(H(s)\\\\) be identified without adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming no alterations or noise in the recording, and knowing the input voltage, one can use the Laplace Transform on both the input and response to obtain \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{I(s)}{V(s)}\\\\). Therefore, it is feasible to deduce the original transfer function directly from recorded data under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
