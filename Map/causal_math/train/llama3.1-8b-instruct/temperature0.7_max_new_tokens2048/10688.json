  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original time-domain function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is its transformation in the s-domain. We examine the system's response when subject to an operator \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nGiven the final observed output from the system, can we determine precisely what operations were implemented (whether \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( K(s) \\\\), or both) based solely on that output?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature and parameters of the interventions (the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)) just from the final output is challenging. Multiple combinations of shifts and parameter values could lead to the same resulting function in the time domain, thus obscuring the precise interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
