  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by a linear time-dependent operator \\\\( L(t) = Ae^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar. The evolution of the system without interventions follows the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t L(s)z(s) ds + z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nObserving \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some final time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we don't know the function \\\\( L(t) \\\\) that was applied continuously?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of \\\\( L(t) \\\\), particularly how \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) interact with the system over time, it's impossible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unequivocally. The continuous interaction of \\\\( L(t) \\\\) with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) means knowing the end state alone isn't sufficient to backtrack accurately without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
