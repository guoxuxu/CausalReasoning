  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a complex constant. We analyze how a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint, can we determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the final value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to multiple potential combinations of effects caused by \\\\( e^{Pt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\). These transformations could produce the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from different starting points and interventions, leading to inherent ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
