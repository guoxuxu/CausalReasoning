  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{izt} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represents a function of time. This scenario deals with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and explores what happens as this transformation is applied to different functional forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is a sine function, without any intervention, will the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) retain the sinusoidal nature of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a sine function results in Dirac delta functions at specific frequencies corresponding to the sine wave, thus transforming the time-domain sinusoidal nature into a frequency-domain representation. This significantly alters the nature from sinusoidal to spiky.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
