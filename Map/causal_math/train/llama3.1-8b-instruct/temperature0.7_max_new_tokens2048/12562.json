  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a complex potential field given by \\\\( V(z) = z^2 + iz \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number describing the position of the particle on the complex plane. We investigate the trajectories using the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z e^{-it} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the potential \\\\( V(z) \\\\) and not on the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce modifications to the trajectory that interact with the potential \\\\( V(z) \\\\). These transformations add and then remove a rotational complex factor, making the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the original trajectory and the effects of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
