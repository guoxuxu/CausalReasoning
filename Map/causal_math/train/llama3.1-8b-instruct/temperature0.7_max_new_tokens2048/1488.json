  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform operation on a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how it interacts with a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\( u \\\\) is an external input. The causal inference is about the effect of changes in \\\\( u \\\\) through a time-dependent control function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), which is applied before taking the Laplace Transform.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the output \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which control functions were applied (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the transformed output?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to a deconvolution problem in system identification, multiple combinations of control interventions (\\\\( h(t) \\\\) and/or \\\\( k(t) \\\\)) could yield an identical or near-identical transformed output due to overlapping effects in the transform domain. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
