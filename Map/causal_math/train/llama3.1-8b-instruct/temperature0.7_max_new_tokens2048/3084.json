  "Problem": "In a control system, the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear system \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. A transformation is applied defined by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations and control inputs were used (both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)), merely by observing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to retroactively determine all interventions (both the transformation applied and the control inputs used). The contributions of \\\\( F \\\\) in \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) to the state trajectory leave multiple possible combinations of factors that could result in the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
