  "Problem": "Consider a system is modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = f(t) + ig(t) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. Integral operator \\\\( K \\\\) defined by \\\\( K[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) acts on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during its evolution.\n\nIf a new operator \\\\( L[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)^2}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 reflect the effects of both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) or only \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) as an intervention modifies the system dynamics and intertwines with the effect of \\\\( K \\\\). The final output, \\\\( K[z](T) \\\\), will carry the influence of both operators, as the effect of the intervention \\\\( L \\\\) will accumulate and integrate with the ongoing transformation by \\\\( K \\\\). The final state results from an interplay of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
