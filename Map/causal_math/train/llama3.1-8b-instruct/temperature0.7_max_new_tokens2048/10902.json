  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex number. We are exploring how the function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) impacts z over time t, where Q is another complex number.\n\nUsing the final observed value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely infer \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the factor e^(Q T) may have significantly altered the initial conditions, resulting in different possible values for \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
