  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator equation \\\\(Lx = \\lambda x\\\\). Analyze how utilizing a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{i\\theta}x\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\theta\\\\) a constant, affects the system over a time-scale \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(T(x)\\\\), \\\\(S(x)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\(T(x)\\\\) and \\\\(S(x)\\\\) contribute only a phase adjustment by factors of \\\\(e^{i\\theta}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{i\\phi}\\\\) respectively, and these factors do not influence the original dynamics of L, the exact interventions cannot be pinpointed solely based on the final state due to possible overlaps and identity elements in phase shifts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
