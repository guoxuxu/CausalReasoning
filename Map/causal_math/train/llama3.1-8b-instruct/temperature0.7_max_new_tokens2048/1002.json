  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a matrix-valued function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane and is examined over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\), it's impossible to determine if the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Mz_0 \\\\). The potential alteration by \\\\( M \\\\) creates an ambiguity in tracing back to the true \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
