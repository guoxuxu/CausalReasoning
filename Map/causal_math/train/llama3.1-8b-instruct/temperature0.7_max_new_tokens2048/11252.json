  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation in a vector space governed by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We are considering the impact of applying another linear operator transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = Mx \\\\) at time t=0, where \\\\( M \\\\) is also a linear operator.\n\nGiven only the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the transformations (\\\\( F(x) \\\\) or \\\\( G(x) \\\\), or both) applied to the system, merely from knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the commutative properties of the linear operators and their exponential action over time, it is not feasible to discern the particular interventions applied just by observing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Multiple different transformation paths can yield the same \\\\( x(T) \\\\) owing to the superposition and compositional variability of linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
