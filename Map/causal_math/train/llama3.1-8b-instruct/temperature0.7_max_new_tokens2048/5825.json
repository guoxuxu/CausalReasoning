  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by two variables x and y, related by the complex function \\( z = x + yi \\). We look into how the function \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z \\, ds \\) influences z over time t, where A is a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied starting from the initial state \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then evolved naturally under the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\) without additional intervention, will the state \\( z(t) \\) at t = T adhere strictly to the trajectory as if \\( z_0 \\) were simply evolved using \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\( f(z) \\) introduces an integral transformation that modifies the initial conditions. The evolution of \\( z(t) \\) from this altered state under \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\) will not strictly follow the trajectory of \\( z_0 \\) evolved without the transformation, as \\( f(z) \\) affects the phase and magnitude of the complex state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
