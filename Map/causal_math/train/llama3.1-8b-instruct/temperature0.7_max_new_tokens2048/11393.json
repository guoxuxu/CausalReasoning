  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a resistor, inductor, and capacitor in series, governed by the second-order linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C} i = 0\\\\). Suppose a voltage transformation given by \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\) is applied to the circuit, where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are constants.\n\nDoes the application of the voltage transformation \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) impact the subsequent current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) throughout the circuit for all times t > 0 in the same way if the circuit was not initially charged?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the voltage transformation changes the initial conditions for the circuit's differential equation. It provides an initial forcing function that perturbs the circuit's natural response, thus impacting the current irrespective of initial charge state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
