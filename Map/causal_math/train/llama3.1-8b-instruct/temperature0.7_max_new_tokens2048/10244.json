  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We examine the response of the system under a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), which acts on \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at time T, can we distinctly identify whether the phase shift intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, just by analyzing \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a phase shift modifies the phase spectrum observable in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). If a phase shift due to \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it introduces a phase discrepancy detectable in the Fourier analysis, allowing identification of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
