  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = {\\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sA} x(s) ds} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function defined by some physical or chemical process. We assess the effect of the linear operator \\\\( L(z) = Bz \\\\), with B being another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nGiven the system's final state at \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were taken (whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could potentially be achieved through various combinations of interventions due to matrix properties like commutativity and the superposition principle. This ambiguity in transformations makes it impossible to delineate the interventions without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
