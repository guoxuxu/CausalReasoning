  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator subjected to complex forcing described by the equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency and C is a complex amplitude. We explore the effects of transformation using the Laplace Transform on the solution.\n\nIf at some intermediate time a new forcing term \\\\(De^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint behavior of the system vary solely based on the original amplitude C without being influenced by the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new forcing term adds complexities to the system's behavior, influencing its response not just by the initial complex amplitude C but also by the newly introduced D. The cumulative effect of these terms needs to be considered to accurately predict the endpoint behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
