  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider transformations of the form \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z + \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\delta t}z + \\\\theta \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the original parameters (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds new elements to the system dynamics making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) but also influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\). The interactions between these transformations and the original system parameters affect the trajectory and thus the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
