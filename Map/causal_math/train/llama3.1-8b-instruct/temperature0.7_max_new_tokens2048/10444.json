  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic differential equation modeled by \\\\(dX_t = \\mu(X_t, t) dt + \\sigma(X_t, t) dW_t\\\\), where \\\\(\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) are functions of the state \\\\(X_t\\\\) and time t, and \\\\(W_t\\\\) represents a standard Brownian motion. We explore the effect of modifying the initial state by a deterministic transformation given by \\\\(h(X) = X + k\\\\), where k is a fixed constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(X(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(h(X)\\\\), \\\\(g(X)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(X(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the stochastic nature of the equation and the dependency on Brownian motion, the same endpoint \\\\(X(T)\\\\) could potentially occur through various routes involving different sequences and timings of applying \\\\(h(X)\\\\) and \\\\(g(X)\\\\). The randomness inherent in the process makes it infeasible to uniquely determine the transformations used based on the end state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
