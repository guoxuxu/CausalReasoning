  "Problem": "Imagine an electrical RLC circuit with a voltage source described by a sinusoidal function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the amplitude, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The response of the circuit is analytically described by the Laplace transform of the voltage across different circuit elements.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at steady-state, can we infer the original angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the sinusoidal voltage source without additional information about the circuit configuration?",
  "Explanation": "The information provided by the steady-state current's Laplace transform does not uniquely determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without knowing circuit parameters like resistances, inductance, and capacitance, as these parameters affect the relationship between \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and \\\\( I(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
