  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane over time t. Analyze the transformations applied by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and the implications of these transformations over time.\n\nIf we observe the evolution of the system to be \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), can we conclude that the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) was not applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) suggests a typical evolution of the original system without any transformations. Since applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the system's evolution to \\\\( e^{2it} \\\\), observing \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) indicates that the transformation was not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
