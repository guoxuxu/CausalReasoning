  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) over the domain [0,1], where \\\\( L \\\\) is defined by the integral transformation \\\\( Lf(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\) and \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is a kernel function representing a complex interaction.\n\nIf we only observed the final output after applying \\\\( L \\\\), could we determine with certainty whether \\\\( M(x) = e^{cx} \\\\) was used before the transformation on a certain function?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise modulation or pre-transformational function applied to the input just from the final output of \\\\( L \\\\) is generally infeasible without additional information. The integral transformation with a complex interaction kernel conceals specific attributions regarding pre-applied functions unless specific properties of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
