  "Problem": "Consider a physical system under the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 \\\\phi = \\\\rho\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is the potential field and \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the charge density. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform to both sides of the equation in the context of changing system conditions.\n\nIf an external field is introduced as an intervention affecting \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\), and only the resultant \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is measured, can the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) indicate this external influence distinctly?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an external field alters \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\), which modifies \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) under the Poisson equation. Since these changes are reflected in \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) will still indicate the change. The properties of the Fourier transform allow it to capture these influences as variations in the frequency domain, distinguishing the impact of external fields.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
