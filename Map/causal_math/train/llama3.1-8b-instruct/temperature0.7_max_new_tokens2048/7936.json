  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in complex function theory, defined by the equation \\\\(Ax = \\\\lambda x\\\\), where A is a linear operator on a complex vector space, and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are the eigenvalues. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt\\\\) on the eigenvalues.\n\nKnowing only the transformed eigenvalues at time t and that some intervention took place, can we precisely deduce whether operator A or C (or both) was adjusted?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed eigenvalues are influenced by the intervention and the inherent complexity of overlapping influences in exponential matrix operations. This outcome creates ambiguity concerning the specific contributions of operator A or C, or their combined effects unless additional information about the nature and timing of interventions is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
