  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} + Bz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant complex numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The situation investigates the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f(z)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over a period T.\n\nConsidering the end result of \\\\( T[f(z)] \\\\) after an intervention changing B to B', can we precisely backtrack to determine whether and when the intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral's aggregate nature and the continuous influence of both \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) and \\\\( Bz \\\\) over time, distinguishing the exact point and nature of intervention involving B to B' transformation is obscured. Components of both the original and altered terms are convoluted within the integral, complicating precise separation and identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
