  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) ds\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is an input function altering the state. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\), where C is a constant matrix transformation applied to the input.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(u(s)\\\\) from s = 0 to T, without other interventions, will the function \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u(s)\\\\) was directly used to compute \\\\(y(t)\\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying transformation \\\\(f(u) = Cu\\\\) modifies the input, hence the convolution integral changes due to different integrand \\\\(e^{A(t-s)} B Cu(s)\\\\). Since C influences the form of \\\\(u(s)\\\\), the resulting \\\\(y(t)\\\\) will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
