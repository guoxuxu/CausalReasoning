  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that represents the temperature distribution over a rod, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a positive constant. We analyze the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIs it possible, by observing the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at a given time T, to determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the result at time T does not allow us to conclusively decompose the contributions of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\) or ascertain their specific application times without additional information. The sinusoidal modifications might interfere constructively or destructively, leading to multiple plausible histories compatible with the observed state.",
