  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) by applying \\\\( f(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. This scenario explores how this transformation, particularly the Laplace transform, affects causal inference in a system's response.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) and this transformed function is used as initial input to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ky \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, will the system response \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) was directly used as input to the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform modifies \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) into its s-domain representation, altering how the system processes the input. The differential equation solution will evolve based on this transformed input, leading to differing outcomes due to the modified input characteristics in the s-domain versus time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u_0(t) → f(u_0(t)); f(u_0(t)) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → s; s → f(u_0(t)); f(u_0(t)) → differential equation; differential equation → system response y(t); y(t) → t = T; system response y(t) → K; K → differential equation; K → system response y(t); u_0(t) → differential equation; differential equation → system response y(t)"
