  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, with k being a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{k0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\). However, the compound effect of \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) on the solution of the differential equation \\\\( z(t) = z_0e^{it} \\\\) creates a modified trajectory \\\\( z(t) = z_0e^{(i+k)t} \\\\), thus yielding a different result at any time T, except in specific cases where k = -i.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
