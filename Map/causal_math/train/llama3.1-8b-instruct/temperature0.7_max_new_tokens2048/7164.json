  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) within a domain. We explore the influence of boundary conditions altering the function \\\\(u\\\\) through an integral transformation \\\\(T[u] = \\\\int_D k(x,y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\(k(x, y)\\\\) is a kernel modifying \\\\(u\\\\) along the boundary \\\\(D\\\\).\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), is it feasible to accurately determine which transformations (either \\\\(T[u]\\\\), \\\\(S[u]\\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution of \\\\(u\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Attributing specific changes in \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) to particular transformations is challenging without additional details about the nature of interventions or initial conditions. Multiple combinations of transformations can yield equivalent end states due to the superimposition and non-linear effects in boundary condition modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
