  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is a scalar potential field. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) introduced at a specific location in the domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying a different transformation \\\\(h(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi * \\\\cos(x - y)\\\\) at a different point or time, will the final expression of \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) only depend on the original Laplace’s condition and not the specifics of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation modifies the potential field in a new way, particularly multiplying by \\\\(\\\\cos(x - y)\\\\), which itself is not generally a solution to the Laplace equation. This will result in a final potential field that depends on both the form of the original potential and the specific interventions employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
