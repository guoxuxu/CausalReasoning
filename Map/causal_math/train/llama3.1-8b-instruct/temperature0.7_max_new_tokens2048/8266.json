  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + z u_x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex constant. Examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) in modifying the system dynamics.\n\nAfter observing the transformed system at time \\\\( t \\\\), can the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) be uniquely reconstructed without knowing whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether the Laplace transform was employed, and inversely applying it correctly, it is impossible to accurately retrieve \\\\( f(x) \\\\) since the transform might have significantly altered the functional characteristics dependent on \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
