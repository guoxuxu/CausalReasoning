  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional domain. Let \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, t) \\\\) be the velocity field, and suppose a transformation by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\psi \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a stream function representing a perturbation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new perturbation \\\\( \\\\mathbf{w}=\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\phi \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is another stream function) is applied as an intervention, will the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original Navier-Stokes dynamics and not on the introduced perturbations \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another perturbation \\\\( \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\) alters the flow dynamics further, making the resulting velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, y, T) \\\\) dependent on the effects and interactions of both \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\), in addition to the intrinsic dynamics dictated by the Navier-Stokes equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
