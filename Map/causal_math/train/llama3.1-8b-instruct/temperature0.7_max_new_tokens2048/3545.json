  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), will the transformed function at time t be the same as the initial function \\\\( z(0) = e^{i0} = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( Dz(t) = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = ie^{it} = iz(t) \\\\) alters the function by multiplying it with i. This results in a rotational transformation in the complex plane, and therefore, \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at each t ≠ 0 is not equal to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
