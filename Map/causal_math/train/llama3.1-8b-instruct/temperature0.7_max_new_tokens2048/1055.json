  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a filtering operation characterized by a function \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) is applied in Fourier space, will the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\) alters the state in Fourier space, affecting the components of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) based on the filter characteristics. This change will directly affect the final state at time T, making it dependent on both \\\\(L\\\\) and the nature of \\\\(\\\\hat{g}(k)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
