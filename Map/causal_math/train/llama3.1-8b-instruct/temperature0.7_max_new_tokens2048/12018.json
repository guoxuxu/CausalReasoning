  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf at \\\\( z_2 \\\\), an operation \\\\( g(w) = e^{Bw} \\\\) (where B is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state of the system at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) for \\\\( z_1 > z_2 \\\\) compute as if only the \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) was integral transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\\\( g(w) \\\\) at \\\\( z_2 \\\\) alters the problem setup significantly. While the original system was affected only by way of A, the introduction of B at a mid-point introduces another layer of complexity, making the behavior dependent on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
