  "Problem": "In the examination of a physical system governed by the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\), where c is the wave speed, consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) applied to u(x, t) and its properties across time and space.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a modifying function \\\\( g(u) = e^{ikx}u \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the wave speed c and not on the initial condition or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the modifying function \\\\( g(u) = e^{ikx}u \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a spatially varying phase shift into the wave profile. This alteration affects the subsequent evolution of the wave under the wave equation, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on the initial condition, the properties of the wave equation, and the specifics of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "wave speed c → wave equation; initial condition → Fourier transform; intervention function g(u) → modified Fourier transform; modified Fourier transform → endpoint wave profile u(x, T); wave speed c → endpoint wave profile u(x, T)"
