  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations evolving over time given by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The impact of a Laplace Transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t))(s) \\\\), is investigated, where s represents a complex variable.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be perfectly reconstructed from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at any time T without explicit knowledge of transformation details?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is invertible under suitable conditions on the function u and the operator L. Given \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\), one can apply the inverse Laplace Transform to retrieve \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at any time, including t = 0, provided no non-linear or external transformations affect it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
