  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a function space, defined as \\( L[f](x) = \\int_0^x k(x, t) f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a kernel function. We analyze the impact of a multiplying factor \\( g(x) \\) on the function \\( f(x) \\) before applying the operator.\n\nIf the function \\( f(x) \\) is multiplied by \\( g(x) \\) resulting in \\( h(x) = g(x)f(x) \\), and the operator \\( L \\) is then applied to \\( h(x) \\) without further changes, will \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\) be the same as \\( L[f](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\) modified by \\( g(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\( g(x) \\) before applying \\( L \\) changes the integral's result since \\( L \\) operates on the product \\( g(t)f(t) \\), and the kernel function \\( k(x, t) \\) interacts differently with \\( g(t)f(t) \\) than with \\( f(t) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
