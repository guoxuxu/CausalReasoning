  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x \\) a constant vector in complex space. The function transforms \\( z(t) \\) using an operator \\( T \\) defined as \\( Tz = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another constant matrix and \\( T \\) is a fixed terminal time.\n\nGiven the outcome \\( Tz \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we determine precisely the sequence or the specific interventions (whether \\( T \\) or \\( S \\) or both) applied during the evolution, based only on the value of \\( Tz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of exponential operators \\( e^{At} \\), \\( e^{Bt} \\), and \\( e^{Ct} \\) within integral transformations, and their potential non-commutativity, it is challenging to deduce specific interventions from \\( Tz \\). Different combinations of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), and intervals of application might yield the same or similar outcomes \\( Tz \\), obscuring the exact history of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
