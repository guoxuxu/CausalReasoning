  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz + B \\\\cos(t)z \\\\), where A and B are constant real numbers. The study involves a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where C is also a constant real number.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system then evolves under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the differential equation to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions, thereby altering the trajectory of the system. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the differential equation with an altered initial state never matches the evolution from the untransformed initial state due to the exponential factor involving C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
