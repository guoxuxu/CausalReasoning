  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system wherein time-series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a convolution with a kernel function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(\\\\tau)h(t - \\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). We explore the impact of the Laplace Transform on this convolution and its causal inference under several scenarios.\n\nIf, after the convolution and before applying the Laplace Transform, an additional linear time-invariant system \\\\( g(t) \\\\) affects the signal generating \\\\( y'(t) = y(t) * g(t) \\\\), then does the Laplace Transform of the new output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y'(t)) \\\\) solely depend on the original data \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the output by an additional convolution, making \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y'(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) \\\\), and hence, the resulting transform is dependent on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as well as \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), illustrating dependent transformation dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
