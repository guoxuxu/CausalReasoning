  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain \\\\( z \\\\) described as \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of a complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number representing rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the angles in the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) are adjusted (intervened) by another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a real number different from \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduce another modifying rotation, making the final complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( c \\\\) but also on both angles \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\). These transformations can affect the trajectory in complex plane and consequently alter the end result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
