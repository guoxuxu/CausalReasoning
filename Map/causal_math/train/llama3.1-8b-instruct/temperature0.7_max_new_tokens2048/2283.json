  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( U(z) = z e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) as another complex constant, is applied at time t_1 > 0, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the initial differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( U(z) \\\\) at time t_1 introduces an additional modifying factor, \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), affecting the evolution of the state from t_1 to T. Thus, the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) are influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), leading to a composition of effects which are not solely attributable to the original equation.",
