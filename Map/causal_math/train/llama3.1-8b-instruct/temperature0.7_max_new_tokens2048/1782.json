  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ky \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant linking \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and another independent real-valued function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\\\alpha y \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a positive decay constant. We analyze the impact of an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformation by \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), which might have altered the initial conditions, cannot be reversed or traced back uniquely due to its dependency on constant \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
