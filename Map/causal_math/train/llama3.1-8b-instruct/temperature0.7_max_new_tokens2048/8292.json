  "Problem": "Consider a network of resistors in an electrical circuit, where the voltage is governed by the equation \\\\(V = ZI\\\\), with \\\\(Z\\\\) being the impedance matrix, which is a function of the complex frequency \\\\(s\\\\). Now, a Fourier transform of the voltage signal \\\\(V(s)\\\\), noted as \\\\(\\\\hat{V}(s)\\\\), introduces a transformation by the function \\\\(f(V) = e^{st}V\\\\). We evaluate the effects on current \\\\(I\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine definitively what voltage transformation was applied (whether \\\\(f(V)\\\\) or another function), based solely on knowing \\\\(I(T)\\\\) and \\\\(Z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The relationship between voltage and current is dependent on the intervening transformations and the impedance matrix. Determining the specific transformation from \\\\(I(T)\\\\) without additional details about the changes in voltage or additional interventions is not feasible due to the complexity of the influence of multiple factors on the observed current.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
