  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. We analyze the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) periodically, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then left to evolve governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly subjected to evolution up to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) alters the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). Since the dynamics include a nonlinear term \\\\( kz^2 \\\\), the evolution trajectory will be altered, leading to different states at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
