  "Problem": "Assume a complex function space governed by the Laplace equation \\( \\nabla^2 z = 0 \\), where \\( z \\) is a function of complex variable \\( x+iy \\). We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( T(u) \\) defined as \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}u(t) dt \\), applied to functions within this space.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function transformation \\( G(v) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-pt}v(t) dt \\) (where \\( p \\) is a new parameter) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(x+iy, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the Laplace solution of \\( u_0 \\) and not on \\( T(u) \\) or \\( G(v) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( G(v) \\) introduces another transformation, shifting the Laplace space dynamics, which makes the endpoint \\( z(x+iy, T) \\) influenced by both \\( T(u) \\) and \\( G(v) \\). This alters the path and consequently the result, under \\( \\nabla^2 z = 0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
