  "Problem": "Consider a damped harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping and angular frequency parameters, respectively. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation on the initial conditions by applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x_0e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is let to evolve according to its natural dynamics, will the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under the given differential equation without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) changes the initial conditions and effectively modifies the system's response trajectory. The solution of the oscillator, factoring in the exponential term \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) introduced by \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will impact both the amplitude and the phase of the oscillations, resulting in a fundamentally different trajectory at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
