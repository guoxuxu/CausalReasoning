  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process characterized by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real constants representing decay/growth rates and oscillatory behavior respectively. We explore the consequence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on the process.\n\nKnowing the endpoint of the integrated value \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude which transformations and in what order (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both, and at what times) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexities added by the transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\) and the overlap of exponential effects in the result of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), multiple scenarios of parameter values and transformation times could yield the same final result. This ambiguity prevents definitively pinpointing which transformations were applied, and when.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
