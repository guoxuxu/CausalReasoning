  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex scalar function z(t) governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\), where A and B are complex constants, and w is a real constant. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{Ct}z + D\\\\), where C and D are complex constants, at different points in time.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( j(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), where F is a complex constant, is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 only be dependent on A, ignoring influences from B, C, or F?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) reflects the combined effects of not only A but also the transformations introduced by B, C, and F. The multiplicative influence of \\\\(j(z)\\\\) and \\\\(h(z)\\\\), along with the sinusoidal effect from B, together define a trajectory that is uniquely contingent upon all parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
