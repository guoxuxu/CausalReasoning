  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, representing the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( A \\\\). We evaluate the effects of applying Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer if any modifications (like transformation by \\\\( D \\\\)) were applied at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, while providing detailed frequency content, lacks the specificity to reveal the distinct types or presence of time-domain transformational interventions like \\\\( D \\\\) without additional contextual information. Multiple transformations could result in similar spectral outputs, thus masking specific intervention details.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If a modification D is applied at some point t1, then it will cause a modification to z, which in turn causes the Fourier transform, resulting in an inference that affects \\mathcal{F}(z)."
