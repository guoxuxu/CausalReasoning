  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) represented in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. The impact of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) is considered, where R is also a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of the interventions \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) and different parameters (R and S) could potentially yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the complex interactions and non-linearity introduced by the exponentials. Thus, identifying the exact interventions from the endpoint alone is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
