  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial angle \\\\(\\\\theta(0)\\\\) after observing only the rotated position at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( M(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the rotational matrix \\\\( M(t) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear by how much the original angle has changed due to rotation. Observing the end effect alone does not provide sufficient information unless \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
