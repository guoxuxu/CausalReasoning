  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices controlling the system dynamics and input response, respectively, and \\\\(u\\\\) represents an external control input. Consider applying a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z(t)) = sZ(s) - z(0) \\\\), to analyze the system's behavior in the s-domain.\n\nIf initially, no control input \\\\(u\\\\) is applied (i.e., \\\\(u = 0\\\\) for all \\\\(t\\\\)), and the system is allowed to evolve from \\\\(z_0\\\\), will the Laplace-transformed output \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) be solely dependent on the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) and initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With \\\\(u = 0\\\\), the equation simplifies to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), and its Laplace transform becomes \\\\(sZ(s) - z(0) = DZ(s)\\\\). Solving this results in \\\\(Z(s) = (sI - D)^{-1}z(0)\\\\), indicating that the transformed output depends only on \\\\(D\\\\) and the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\), without any impact from the control matrix \\\\(C\\\\).",
