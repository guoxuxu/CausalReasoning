  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices and u represents a control input. We analyze the behavior of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to express solutions in terms of complex frequencies.\n\nGiven the transformed system output \\\\( X(s) \\\\) in the absence of any control inputs, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) of the system without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Unless additional constraints or complete knowledge about the system's characteristics and matrix M are known, there are generally infinite possible initial states \\\\( x(0) \\\\) that could result in a given \\\\( X(s) \\\\) due to the nature of solutions to linear differential equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
