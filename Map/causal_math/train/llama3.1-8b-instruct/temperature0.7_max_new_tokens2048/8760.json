  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system is defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied to the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nHaving the observed final state values \\\\( u(T) \\\\) and \\\\( v(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely deduce the form and timing of intervention by matrix D among other matrices, based solely on these observed outcomes?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations and timings of applying the matrix D or similar perturbations can result in the same observed outcomes due to the complex interplay between the governing matrices and intervening transformations. The degrees of freedom in choice and timing of D make it impossible to uniquely determine interventions from final state observations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
