  "Problem": "Suppose a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz + I(t)\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\(I(t)\\\\) represents a time-dependent input. The transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is another constant complex matrix, is considered.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we clearly determine the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, we lack crucial information about whether the initial state was transformed. This absence of knowledge makes it impossible to uniquely retrodict \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) potentially alters the initial state in ways that are not discernible solely from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
