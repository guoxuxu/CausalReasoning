  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We evaluate the role of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Dt}z \\\\) (where R is a rotation matrix and D is another constant matrix) over time t.\n\nSuppose that at some instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( k(z) = Se^{Ft}z \\\\) (where S is another rotation matrix and F a constant matrix) is applied. Does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the matrix C, or do R, D, S, and F also play a role?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( k(z) = Se^{Ft}z \\\\) further modifies the dynamics introduced by R and D, as well as the base system governed by C. The interaction between these matrices, especially as none might commute with the others, means that R, D, S, and F significantly influence the trajectory and final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), not just C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
