  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by an integral transform \\\\( L[u(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation. Suppose we introduce a perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + p(x) \\\\).\n\nWill the operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the perturbed function \\\\( v(x) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( L[v(x)] \\\\), result in the same transformed outcome as if \\\\( L \\\\) was applied solely to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without the perturbation?",
  "Explanation": "Because \\\\( L \\\\) is linear, applying \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) \\\\) results in \\\\( L[u(x)] + L[p(x)] \\\\). Unless \\\\( L[p(x)] = 0 \\\\) for all x, this is not equivalent to \\\\( L[u(x)] \\\\). The presence of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) changes the outcome of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
