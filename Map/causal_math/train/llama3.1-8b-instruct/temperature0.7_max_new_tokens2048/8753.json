  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a constant complex number. We analyze how this function transforms the input \\\\( z \\\\) over iterative applications, particularly under the Mandelbrot set conditions.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is iteratively applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), will the series diverge without any additional intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Depending on the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the parameter c, the iterated function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can lead to a series that diverges, known behavior in the study of the Mandelbrot set. For certain values, particularly outside the Mandelbrot set boundary, the magnitude of successive iterations grows without bound.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
