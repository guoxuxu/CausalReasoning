  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the application of a Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), affects the signal analysis over time.\n\nIf at a certain time, an intervention by applying an Inverse Laplace Transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{X(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is the Laplace Transform of another signal, is introduced, will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial signal characteristics and not on the characteristics of the intervening Inverse Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an Inverse Laplace Transform as an intervention introduces a new signal into the time domain influenced by the properties of the transformed function \\\\( X(s) \\\\). The final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will thus be significantly influenced by these changes and will not solely depend on the initial signal characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
