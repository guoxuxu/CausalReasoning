  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) is defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix, impacts the system over a period of time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct which transformations were used (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or nature of interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging due to the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials and their impact on the trajectory. Different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) could lead to similar or identical final states, especially without additional information about their specific forms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
