  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) is set initially and the system evolves under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) in the domain be solely determined by this boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "The boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) uniquely determines the solution to the Laplace equation in the 2D domain under consideration since the Laplace equation is linear and the problem's data is specified without ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
