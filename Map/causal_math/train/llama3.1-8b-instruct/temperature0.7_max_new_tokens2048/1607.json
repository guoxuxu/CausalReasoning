  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant vector in complex space. This function is used to transform an initial vector in a complex vector space. We investigate the influence of applying an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) at a time t, where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention with the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) is introduced at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant state at time \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the mechanism governing the state evolution initially set by \\\\( A \\\\). Post-intervention, the new influence of \\\\( D \\\\) will interact with the effects of \\\\( A \\\\), affecting the trajectory and thereby the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\). Hence, both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) will dictate the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
