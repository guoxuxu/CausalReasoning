  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving via the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. The whole system undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to a transformed space where \\\\( sX(s) = AX(s) \\\\) and \\\\( sY(s) = BY(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is set without any previous condition and then evolved over time without any external intervention under the given system equations, will the function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) at time t = T represent the straightforward integration of its initial components under their respective transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Without any external interference, the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is purely determined by their respective differential equations. \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T directly results from the evolution of \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) under the exponential of the matrices A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
