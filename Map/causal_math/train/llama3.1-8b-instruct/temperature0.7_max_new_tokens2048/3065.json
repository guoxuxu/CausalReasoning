  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) starting at t = 0 and then evolves under \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\) without any further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) \\) changes the initial state by integrating over a transformed trajectory influenced by \\( D \\). This modified trajectory under the influence of both \\( D \\) and \\( C \\) leads to a state at time T that is different from pure evolution under \\( C \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
