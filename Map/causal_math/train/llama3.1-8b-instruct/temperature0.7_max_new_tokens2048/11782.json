  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention via another function \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{St} \\\\) (where \\\\( S \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( R \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional variable that modifies the state parallel to the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), reflecting changes induced at different instances through \\\\( T \\\\) in addition to the inherent evolution under \\\\( P \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
