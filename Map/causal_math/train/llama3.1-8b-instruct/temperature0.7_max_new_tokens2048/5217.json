  "Problem": "Consider the transfer function of a linear system represented by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We investigate the system's response to complex inputs and the effect of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the input to the system \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a sine wave, will the output at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) solely depend on the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without any additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The system's output in response to a sinusoidal input is defined entirely by its transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), representing the system's inherent linear response without further transformation. Frequency analysis directly relates to characterizing such systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
