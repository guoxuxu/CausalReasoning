  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then let to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) alters the magnitude of the complex number, modifying its trajectory from the outset. As \\\\( k \\\\) increases or decreases the magnitude exponentially, the evolved state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), differs in magnitude compared to direct evolution under the differential equation alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
