  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic integral transform \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ax^2 + bx} f(t) dt \\\\), with constants \\\\( a, b \\\\) real and positive. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how the transform influences causal relationships by analyzing its effect on a specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how interventions might affect outcomes.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a Gaussian function, say \\\\( f(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( G(x) \\\\) is applied without further changes, will the resulting function still be a Gaussian function?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform essentially modifies the parameters of the Gaussian, resulting in another Gaussian. The quadratic nature of \\\\( x \\\\) in the exponential term guarantees that the resultant transform will maintain the Gaussian form, although the mean and variance might be altered based on the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
