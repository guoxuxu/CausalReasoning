  "Problem": "Consider a heat distribution on a metal rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents the temperature at point x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. Assess the effect of a heat source represented by a function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) added at specific points over time.\n\nIf a cooling function \\\\(c(x, t) = -r u\\\\) (where r is a constant rate of heat removal) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) be independent of the earlier heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\(c(x, t)\\\\) changes the system dynamics post-intervention; however, the effect of the earlier heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at t=0 still influences the temperature distribution up to time \\\\(t_1\\\\), and indirectly affects the subsequent evolution of the temperature. Hence, \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) remains dependent on both the initial heat source and the cooling intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
