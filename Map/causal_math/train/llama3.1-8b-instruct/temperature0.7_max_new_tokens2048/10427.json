  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The complex function transformations involve \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices operating in the complex domain over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is a different constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system, affecting the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the endpoint at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The final state depends not only on the original differential equation parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also significantly on A and B, which dictate the transformation behaviors at different time intervals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
