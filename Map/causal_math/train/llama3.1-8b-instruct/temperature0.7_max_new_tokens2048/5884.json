  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nKnowing the position in the complex plane at time T, can we specifically determine whether the function was squared, and if so, at what times between 0 and T?",
  "Explanation": "The information given by the complex value at T doesn't uniquely reveal if or when an intervention occurred due to the continuity and periodicity of the exponential function. Multiple scenarios of squaring and non-squaring, at various times, may lead to the same final complex value at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
