  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The intervention is introduced by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied at a specific time.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (D being another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, is the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, influenced solely by the matrices M and N, disregarding C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\) complicates the trajectory further by introducing D. Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on the interplay and potentially non-commuting effects of M, N, C, and D. Each matrix contributes dynamically, influencing the composite end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
