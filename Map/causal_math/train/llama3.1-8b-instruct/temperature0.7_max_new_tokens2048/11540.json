  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nGiven the transformation output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\), can we definitively determine the time \\\\(t_1\\\\) at which an intervention (such as applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)) occurred, just by examining \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the transformation output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) accumulates evidence of any interventions, its integral nature obfuscates the exact moment of transition unless additional information, like the nature and effects of specific changes to z(t), are known. The transformation's output by itself lacks specificity about when changes occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
