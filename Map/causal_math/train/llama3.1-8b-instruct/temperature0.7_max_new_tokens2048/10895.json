  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nIf an intervention with another differential operator \\( E \\), where \\( Eg(t) = g''(t) + bg(t) \\) (b is a constant), is applied during the process, does the end function \\( h(t) \\) only depend on the original function \\( f(t) \\) and not on the characteristics of \\( D \\) or \\( E \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( E \\) introduces additional changes based on second-order derivatives and scaling by b, affecting the final output \\( h(t) \\). Together with \\( D \\), both transformations significantly alter the function within the Laplace domain, impacting the final inverse transform results beyond just the influence of \\( f(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
