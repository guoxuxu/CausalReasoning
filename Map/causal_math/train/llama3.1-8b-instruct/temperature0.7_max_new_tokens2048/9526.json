  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nAfter observing the trajectory \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T, evolved without knowing whether a Fourier transformation was initially applied, can we ascertain the original trajectory \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of an initial Fourier transformation, recovering the original trajectory \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) is ambiguous because the Fourier transform could alter phase and amplitude conditions that are critical for reconstructing the starting position and velocity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
