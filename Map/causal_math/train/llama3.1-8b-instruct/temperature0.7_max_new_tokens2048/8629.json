  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps complex numbers to other complex numbers, defined by \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) for a real matrix A. The evolution of the function is then impacted by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) known from integral transforms, specifically \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) operates on a complex input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and transforms it to \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\), then allowed to be processed by \\\\( L \\\\) without further transformation, will \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\) at x be influenced by the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) transforms the input based on the matrix A, and upon applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\), the integration will include the transformed state \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\), thus influencing \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\). The matrix A and the initial value \\\\( x_0 \\\\) both play a critical role in the resulting output after integration.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
