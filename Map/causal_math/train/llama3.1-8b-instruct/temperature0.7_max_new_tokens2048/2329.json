  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) defined on complex numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( f \\) being a holomorphic function. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) concerning variable \\( y \\) and the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\) concerning variable \\( x \\) are used to analyze transformed functions.\n\nIf \\( f(x, y) \\) is given initial conditions and transforms are applied sequentially (\\( \\mathcal{L} \\) followed by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\)), does the resulting function remain unchanged if \\( f \\) had been processed with \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) followed by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The order of applying the Laplace and Fourier transforms affects the outcome because the two transforms might not commute depending on the nature of \\( f \\). Holomorphic properties and the specific dependence of \\( f \\) on \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can alter the results of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
