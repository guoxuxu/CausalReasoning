  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nAfter observing the value of \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T} \\\\), can we determine if the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was applied at time t=0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the exact function form or transformation applied at t=0, we cannot uniquely assert whether \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was used just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The observed value at T can result from multiple potential transformations, or from the base function alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
