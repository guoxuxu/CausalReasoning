  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nIf the contour of integration around a simple pole \\( z = ia \\) is considered without any deformation or translation, will the value of the integral change if solely \\( \\omega \\) is varied?",
  "Explanation": "Varying \\( \\omega \\) directly alters the exponential function \\( e^{i\\omega z} \\), which implies changes in the oscillatory part of the integrand. Thus, this directly affects the computed value of the integral around the said pole, leading to a different result even though the pole and residue determination remain unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
