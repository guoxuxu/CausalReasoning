  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and the function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane. This function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) which is the Laplace transform, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any alterations, will the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Laplace transform, \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\), in this scenario depends only on the parameters \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\). The transformation, given the linear and integral nature of the Laplace transform, will directly depend on and be characterized by these parameters without any external influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
