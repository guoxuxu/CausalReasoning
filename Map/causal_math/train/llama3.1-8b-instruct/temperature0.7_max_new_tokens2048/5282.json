  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to this function, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the result of the Laplace Transform at a specific s-value, can we determine uniquely the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform at a specific value of s provides limited information about the time domain behavior of the entire function since it represents a transformed state in a complex frequency domain, lacking full time domain detail.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
