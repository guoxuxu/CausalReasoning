  "Problem": "Analyze a system modeled by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) the initial condition. We consider the impact of applying a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{Bt}x_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the explicit knowledge of convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), one cannot uniquely backtrack to \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) could arise from various convolutions of different functions, obscuring the precise characteristics of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → x_0; x_0 → g(t); B → x_1; x_1 → h(t); f(t) → G(s); G(s) → F(s); F(s) → h(t); h(t) → f(t); x_0 → G(s); x_1 → H(s); G(s)H(s) → F(s); A → g(t); B → h(t); A → G(s); B → H(s); x_0 → g(t) and x_1 → h(t) are the original functions; G(s) and H(s) are Laplace transforms of g(t) and h(t) respectively; F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t); f(t) is the resultant function after convolution"
