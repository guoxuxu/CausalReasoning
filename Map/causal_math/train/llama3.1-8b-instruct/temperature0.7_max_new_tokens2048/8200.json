  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the state is evolved using a linear time-invariant differential equation described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The study will explore the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nBased on the state \\\\( L(x)(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we pinpoint whether the Fourier or Laplace transform (or both) was applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the resultant state at T with transformations like Fourier and Laplace, which operate in different domains (frequency vs. complex frequency), deducing the exact intervention used without additional information is ambiguous. The transformations’ nature doesn’t allow for the isolation of their individual effects purely based on the resultant state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
