  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and i is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf an operation such as multiplication by a scalar function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\), will the resultant transformation only reflect properties of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and not those of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant product \\\\( g(s)T[z](s) \\\\) represents a convolution in the time domain between the inverse transform of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Hence, the resultant transformation contains combined information and dependencies related to both \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), not just \\\\( g(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
