  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output voltage \\( V(t) \\) in an RLC circuit is governed by the differential equation \\( L \\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} V = 0 \\), where L, R, and C are constants representing the inductance, resistance, and capacitance respectively. We examine the impact of a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{V(t)\\} \\) applied to the voltage \\( V(t) \\) and its inverse transform.\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ V(T) \\} \\) at time T, can we precisely determine the initial conditions \\( V(0) \\) and \\( V'(0) \\) (the initial voltage and its derivative) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides a transformed domain representation of the entire signal but does not provide direct access to specific time-domain initial conditions without inverse transformation and additional boundary condition data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
