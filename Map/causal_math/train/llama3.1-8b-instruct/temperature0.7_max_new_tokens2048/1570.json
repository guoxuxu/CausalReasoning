  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and its impact under a Fourier transformation, specifically looking at \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(z)\\\\}(k) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) without knowing if any prior transformation was applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{e^{az}\\\\}(k) \\\\) is specific to \\\\( a \\\\), without information on any prior modification to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), assumptions about solely relying on \\\\( a \\\\) might be invalid. Other transformations could have adjusted the function \\\\( z \\\\) in a way that alters the output of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
