  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where z is a complex number. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on the function over various scenarios.\n\nGiven the result of the transformed function \\\\( g(\\hat{f}) \\\\), can we accurately determine the nature of the intervention (the value of a) used on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) using only the transformed data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific intervention (value of a) from the transformed result alone is challenging due to the complexity introduced by the exponential Square and integral transform. The altered function could yield similar transform results under different interventions, making accurate deduction of a impossible without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
