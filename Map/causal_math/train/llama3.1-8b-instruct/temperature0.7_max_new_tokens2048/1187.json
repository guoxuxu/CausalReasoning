  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation involving the Fourier integral representation by applying the transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{as} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nIf an additional transform \\\\( G(s) = e^{bs} \\\\) (where 'b' is a constant) is applied as an intervention at a certain time, will the resulting transformed function ultimately depend only on \\\\( s \\\\) and not on the constants 'a' or 'b' nor the original form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the additional transformation impacts the original by compounding the effects of the exponentials, resulting in \\\\( F(s)G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{(a+b)s}  .\\\\). The final form of the transform depends on both 'a' and 'b', as well as the structure of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), indicating a dependency beyond just \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
