  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf initial conditions for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are set at \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and we calculate its Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any changes to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), will the transform remain consistent over time if re-calculated at a later time with the same  \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but no change to original conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the system's parameters and the external condition (\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) remain unchanged, the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) calculated at later times will consistently be derived from the same function \\\\( z(t) = z_0e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), thus remaining unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
