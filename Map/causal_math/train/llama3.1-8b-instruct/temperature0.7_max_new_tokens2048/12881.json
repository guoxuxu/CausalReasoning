  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} dt \\\\), where z is a complex number with a positive real part. We explore the impact of two transformations defined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) on the complex plane as \\\\( A(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z \\\\) after calculating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( B(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\), it is impossible to determine whether the increase by 1 occurred before evaluation, as the transformation shifts the complex plane, potentially altering the exponential decay and thus, the integral outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
