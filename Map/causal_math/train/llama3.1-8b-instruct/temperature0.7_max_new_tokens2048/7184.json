  "Problem": "Assume we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. The influence of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being another real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) denoting time, is considered.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the initial differential equation, can we determine exactly which transformations (i.e., \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, and at what times?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of exponential growth or decay and complex plane rotation can mask each other, making it computationally challenging to backtrack and determine the precise nature and timing of transformations based on the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
