  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation is applied: \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a heating function.\n\nIf an intervention by an additional cooling function \\\\( g(u) = u - c(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) compensates for \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at some t_1 > 0, is applied, will this adjustment return the temperature distribution at T > t_1 to that which would have been if neither \\\\( f(u) \\\\) nor \\\\( g(u) \\\\) had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Though the intervention function \\\\( g(u) \\\\) appears to counterbalance the added heat from \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the combined effects over time do not merely cancel out. The interaction of residual temperature variations with the diffusion driven by the heat equation means the outcome at T will still reflect the history of these transformations, not merely an erased or neutral state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
