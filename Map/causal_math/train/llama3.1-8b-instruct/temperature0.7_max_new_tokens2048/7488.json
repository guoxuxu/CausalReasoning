  "Problem": "Consider the interaction between two functions defined over scalar fields, \\\\( u(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( v(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where a and b are constants, in the context of an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left( h(z) \\\\right) = \\\\int_0^z u(\\\\tau) v(z - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nKnowing the modified output \\\\( \\\\tilde{h}(z) \\\\) at some \\\\( z > z_0 \\\\), is it possible to deduce the type or magnitude of intervention applied to \\\\( v(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific modification in \\\\( v(z) \\\\) resulting from the intervention, such as the addition of the term cz, cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( \\\\tilde{h}(z) \\\\) alone. The convolution process may mask the specific changes, thus multiple types or magnitudes of interventions could lead to similar changes in the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
