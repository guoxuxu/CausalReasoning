  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (A u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents a state variable and \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant vector field. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), which changes \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) to its frequency domain representation.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions (like Fourier transform or convolution) were applied throughout the evolution, only by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) might result from various possible sequences and types of interventions, and similar end states can be achieved through different transformations due to the properties of linear operations and possible equivalences or overlaps in the effects of different transforms and convolutions on the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
