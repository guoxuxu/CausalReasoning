  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are interested in the effect of an initial Fourier transform on u(x, 0) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, 0) dx\\\\) and how it evolves under the given equation over time t.\n\nIf an external operation defined by \\\\(g(u) = Mu\\\\) where M is a constant matrix is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) where T > t_1 be independent of the Fourier transform applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the operation \\\\(g(u)\\\\), an additional transformation that affects both frequency and spatial domain responses, means that the final processed outputs at T may depend on the form of initial transformations, including the Fourier transform, through interaction with the matrix M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
