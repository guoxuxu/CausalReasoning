  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are components following the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied at t = 0, the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could result from multiple possible initial conditions, especially since the matrix C could have nontrivial effects such as rotations and dilations that cannot be simply reversed without knowledge of its form.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
