  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit with an impedance represented by the function \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s + c} \\) in the Laplace transform domain, where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. The input to the circuit is a voltage \\( V(s) \\), and the output is current \\( I(s) \\). The response of the circuit is also influenced by an operational amplifier with a Laplace transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\), which can be switched into the circuit as an intervention.\n\nIf the operational amplifier \\( H(s) \\) is switched into the circuit altering the response to \\( I(s) = H(s) \\cdot \\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)} \\), will the output current \\( I(s) \\) be only dependent on \\( V(s) \\) and not \\( Z(s) \\) for all s?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( H(s) \\) as an intervention modifies the response but does not eliminate the dependence on \\( Z(s) \\). The output current \\( I(s) \\) depends on both \\( V(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\), complexly influenced by the transfer function of \\( H(s) \\), which acts as a modifier but not a remover of \\( Z(s)'s \\) impact.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
