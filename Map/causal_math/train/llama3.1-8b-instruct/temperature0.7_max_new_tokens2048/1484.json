  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform after applying a linear filtering intervention, can we uniquely determine whether the original function was \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of linear systems and convolution, multiple combinations of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\), and filtering functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can result in the same Fourier transform outcome. Specific characteristics of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the original function complexity can mask the effects of the delta function, rendering a unique determination impossible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
