  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the use of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iSt} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where S is a complex constant, to modify z(t).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a result of multiple, potentially overlapping transformations. The effects of the integral and exponential transformations could yield equivalent results under different parameter configurations (S and U), making it impossible to differentiate the exact interventions used solely based on the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
