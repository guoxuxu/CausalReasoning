  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) purely from the output of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) provides a cumulative sum over time, losing specific frequency information due to integration. This irreversible process melds the instantaneous phases and magnitudes, preventing reconstruction of the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) solely from the output at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
