  "Problem": "We consider a quantum system where the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\( V(x) \\\\). We study the effect of a measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) defined as \\\\( M \\\\psi(x, t_1) = e^{-iH\\\\tau}\\\\psi(x, t_1) \\\\) where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian of the system and \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) is a measurement time interval.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different measurement operator \\\\( N \\\\) defined as \\\\( N \\\\psi(x, t_2) = e^{-iH\\\\delta} \\\\psi(x, t_2) \\\\) is applied where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is another time interval, does the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial Hamiltonian \\\\( H \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both measurement operators \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) alter the state of the system in ways dependent on the Hamiltonian's specifics and their respective application intervals (\\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\)). This makes the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on these interventions alongside the initial Hamiltonian dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
