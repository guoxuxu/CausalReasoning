  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we explore the response of a vector function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane under the effect of a linear operator L and an integral transformation \\\\( T(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\). Assume L is a matrix and s is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the final measurement T(s), can we deduce the sequence or type of linear operators (L, M, or both) used over time only from the knowledge of \\\\( T(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly which operators were applied based solely on the final measurement \\\\( T(s) \\\\) is infeasible. Since multiple sequences of operators could potentially yield similar transformations in complex systems, especially under the process of integration and exponential attenuation in T, the exact operators used cannot be uniquely resolved from the final output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
