  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under a linear transformation described by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) applied on the vector representation \\\\( (x, y) \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(u) du \\) is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we conclusively identify which transformation (by \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\), or both) was applied given the endpoint \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\), just by observing this integral transformation value?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( T[z(T)] \\\\) may result from different permutations of transformations by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), owing to the nature of linear transformations and their superposition principle in integral settings. Different combinations of these transformations can lead to identical or similar outcomes, thus obscuring the clarity of which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
