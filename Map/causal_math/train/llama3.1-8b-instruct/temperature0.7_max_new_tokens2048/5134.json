  "Problem": "Assess the relations within a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. We explore interventions and transformations mediated through the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the system at time T, can we precisely deduce the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was used, it's unclear if the observed state stems from \\\\( e^{DT}x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{DT}Mx_0 \\\\). The potential application of \\\\( M \\\\) can significantly mask or change the original \\\\( x_0 \\\\), complicating trace-back.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
