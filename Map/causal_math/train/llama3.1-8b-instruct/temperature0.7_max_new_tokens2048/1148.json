  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) is initially transformed by applying \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\). We examine how this transformation impacts the integration over a continuous function under different operational conditions.\n\nAfter obtaining the integral from x = 0 to 2, can we determine what transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) purely based on the integral's value?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = \\ln(z) \\\\) on the function, especially when compounds transform back to a form reminiscent of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), make it impossible to distinctly identify whether one, both, or none of the transformations were applied based solely on the integral's outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
