  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a complex constant vector. This scenario investigates the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{iBt}w \\\\) where B is also a real constant, and how it modifies the system's dynamics over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) occurred, determining \\\\( w_0 \\\\) purely based on the system state at t = T is challenging. The possibility that B may have altered the trajectory makes recovery of \\\\( w_0 \\\\) ambiguous, especially without additional information about the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
