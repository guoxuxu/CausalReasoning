  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nCan the specific interventions applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both) be inferred precisely by knowing only the observed state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), distinguishing which transformations or sequences of transformations were applied proves complicated due to the multiple potential trajectories converging to the same final state. This stems from the complex effects introduced by the interplay of the nonlinear transformations \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
