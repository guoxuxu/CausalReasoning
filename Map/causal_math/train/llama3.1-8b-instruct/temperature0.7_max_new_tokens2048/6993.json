  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) that transforms a function \\( u(x) \\) using a convolution integral \\( L[u](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x - t)u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( k \\) is the kernel function. We scrutinize the effects of an initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) and its interaction with different kernels, including potential changes in kernel midway.\n\nIf \\( u_0(x) \\) is initially subjected to the kernel \\( k_1(x) \\), and then allowed to evolve without further alteration, will \\( L[u_0](x) \\) at time T still reflect only the influence of \\( k_1(x) \\) without any other kernel's involvement?",
  "Explanation": "Once \\( u_0(x) \\) is transformed by \\( k_1(x) \\), the resultant function \\( L[u_0](x) \\) will encapsulate the effects of \\( k_1 \\) exclusively, as there is no subsequent kernel interaction involved to alter or modify this outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
