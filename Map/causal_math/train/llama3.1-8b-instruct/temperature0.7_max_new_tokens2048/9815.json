  "Problem": "Analyze the integral transformation \\\\( F(p) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\), where p represents a complex number. We study how changing the parameter p affects the transformation and the resulting function.\n\nIf we intervene by setting \\\\( p \\\\) to a fixed real value \\\\( p = 0 \\\\) after initially starting with \\\\( p = 3i \\\\), will the resultant transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) reflect only the effects of \\\\( p = 0 \\\\) and not of \\\\( 3i \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Setting \\\\( p \\\\) to 0 resets the exponential to 1, essentially integrating \\\\( f(x) = cos(x) \\\\) over its entire domain, leading to divergent behavior. This operation masks any earlier effects potentially caused by \\\\( p = 3i \\\\), since the latter does not influence the outcome post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "p → p = 3i; p = 3i → F(p); F(p) → f(x); p = 0 → F(p); F(p) → resultant transformed function; p = 3i → resultant transformed function; p = 0 → resultant transformed function; p → resultant transformed function; resultant transformed function → reflects effects of p = 3i; resultant transformed function → reflects effects of p = 0"
