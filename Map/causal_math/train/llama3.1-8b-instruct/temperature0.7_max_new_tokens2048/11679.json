  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with conductivity k. An initial heating pattern v(x) is applied as an initial condition and after a time period, a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x,t)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) is a heating function, is introduced.\n\nIf an intervention by the heating function h(x,t) occurs at time t1 such that \\\\(g\\u2028(u) = u + h(x, t)\\u2028\\\\) is applied, will the final temperature distribution u(x, T) for T > t1 be independent of the initial condition v(x)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution u(x, T) will depend on both the initial temperature distribution v(x) and the heating function h(x,t). The addition of h(x,t) at time t1 modifies the subsequent evolution of the system, making the final state a result of both the initial condition and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
