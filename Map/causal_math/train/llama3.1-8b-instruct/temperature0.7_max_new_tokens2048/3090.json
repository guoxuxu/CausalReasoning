  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where u and v are real functions of time and governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) over time t, where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and the specific transformations caused by C, determining the exact initial conditions \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes infeasible. The transformations could significantly obscure the initial state, particularly since C, A, and B may not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
