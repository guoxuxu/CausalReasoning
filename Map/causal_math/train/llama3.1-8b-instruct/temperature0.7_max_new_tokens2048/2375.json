  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) in the complex plane where \\( A \\) is a non-scalar constant matrix. Examine the evolution of the function under different mappings and their compositional effects.\n\nIf at a specific point \\( z_1 \\), a different transformation \\( G(z) = Cz \\) (where \\( C \\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention before \\( f \\), does the outcome \\( f(z) \\) for any \\( z \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( f(z) \\) becomes \\( e^{ACz} \\), influenced by \\( C \\) as well as \\( A \\). If \\( B \\) changes the initial base of \\( z \\) before \\( C \\) is applied, then \\( B \\) also affects the outcome. The non-commutativity of matrix operations emphasizes that \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) all potentially impact the result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
