  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a sudden change is introduced by another integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{t} e^{-i\\\\omega'(s-t_1)}z(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) is another frequency, will the state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) only depend on the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) starts a new transformation process that superimposes effects governed by \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), altering the resultant trajectory and the end state at time \\\\(T\\\\), hence depending on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
