  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) that maps real numbers x, y into the complex plane. The function is defined as \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\), where A and B are fixed complex numbers. We are interested in examining the effects of applying a Laplace transform to x and a Fourier transform to y, and how these transformations influence the calculation of an integral over a defined region.\n\nGiven the integral of the transformed function over a region R, can we determine the original values of x and y for any point in R?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations, being integral transformations, alter the function into a new domain and compress information in a way that loses some of the original specifics of x and y. It is generally not possible to uniquely resolve x or y from the integral of the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
