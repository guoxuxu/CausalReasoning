  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second order linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant representing the speed of sound. We explore the influence of applying an initial displacement by a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) denotes spatial coordinates.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), before reaching T, an additional displacement function \\\\( j(x) \\\\) is applied as an intervention affecting the system's state, will the displacement \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at T rely solely on the initial function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not on intervention \\\\( j(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( j(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the initial conditions and thus affects the subsequent evolution of the displacement according to the wave equation. As a result, the displacement at time T will depend both on \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( j(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
