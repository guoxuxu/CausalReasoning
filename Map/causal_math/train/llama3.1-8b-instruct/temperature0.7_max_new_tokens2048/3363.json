  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf during the evolution a new linear transformation \\\\( S(z) = ez + f \\\\) (where \\\\( e \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\) are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( f(Z) \\\\) for \\\\( Z > 0 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( a \\\\) and not on \\\\( c, d, e, \\\\) or \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( S(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity, affecting the final function value as the function now becomes \\\\( f(S(T(z))) = e^{a(e(cz + d) + f)} \\\\). The parameters \\\\( c, d, e, \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\) can significantly modify the resulting function value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
