  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t) \\\\), where P is a complex constant. We study the effects under the integral transform \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Qt}z(t)dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Pz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be represented accurately just by the integral transform without direct integration?",
  "Explanation": "The form of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) aggregates the function over an interval and modifies the characterization of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( G(z) \\\\) involves both integration and the transformation by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), it will not preserve the precise state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) compared to direct dynamic evolution under \\\\( P \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
