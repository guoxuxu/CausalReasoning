  "Problem": "Consider complex function \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\lambda z}\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine how integral transformations, specifically Laplace Transform, modify this function and impact the final output when the independent variable \\\\(z\\\\)'s real part changes.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(G(s)\\\\) from the Laplace Transform of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), can we determine the exact value of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) without knowing its relationship to the real part of \\\\(z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The form of \\\\(G(s)\\\\), which is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-\\\\lambda}\\\\), directly reveals \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) as the location of the pole, independent of any changes or specific values in the real part of \\\\(z\\\\). Thus, \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) can be determined directly from the character of the pole in \\\\(G(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "change in z's real part → change in z; change in z → change in g(z); change in λ → change in g(z); Laplace Transform → G(s); G(s) → λ; λ → G(s)"
