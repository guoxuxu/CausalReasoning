  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) in a rod and time \\( t \\) obeys the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) with thermal conductivity \\( k \\). We investigate the application of a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(x,t)) \\) to convert spatial components of the heat distribution into the frequency domain at time \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), where \\( t_1 < T \\), to modify the heat distribution \\( T(x,t_1) \\) directly, will the resultant distribution \\( T(x,T) \\) be unaffected by the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Even if a direct modification is applied at \\( t_1 \\), the resultant distribution \\( T(x,T) \\) remains influenced by the initial conditions transformed by \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\). Though post-intervention dynamics influence \\( T(x,T) \\), the effects of the Fourier transform on initial conditions play a significant role in the final state at \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
