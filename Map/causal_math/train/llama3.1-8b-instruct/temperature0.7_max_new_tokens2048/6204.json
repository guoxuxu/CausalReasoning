  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The function is transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether intervention functions \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were used by merely looking at the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations and timings of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could result in the same endpoint, especially considering the non-commutativity of the exponential matrix transformations. This ambiguity prevents precisely inferring the history of interventions based solely on the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
