  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) by applying \\\\( f(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. This scenario explores how this transformation, particularly the Laplace transform, affects causal inference in a system's response.\n\nGiven the system response \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), solely from knowing \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations based on the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone is challenging due to the potential overlap and interaction between the effects of the Laplace transform and the exponential modification by \\\\( g(u) \\\\). The mathematical overlap complicates causal inference, obscuring the direct links between initial functions and final responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
