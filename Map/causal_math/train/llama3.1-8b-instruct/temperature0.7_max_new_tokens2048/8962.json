  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical environment where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes a transformation through a linear time-invariant system described by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system's transfer function is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nKnowing the system's output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T and the system's characteristics \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific details about the modifications imposed by the system's environment or the exact nature of disturbances, recovering the initial form of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just from the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is underdetermined and generally not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
