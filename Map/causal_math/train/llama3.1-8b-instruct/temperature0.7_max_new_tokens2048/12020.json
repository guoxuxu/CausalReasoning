  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf the contour C is altered to a different contour C' enclosing the same poles with the same orientation, and we compute \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{C'} g(w) dw \\\\) under the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of the integral \\\\( f(z) \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "By Cauchy's integral theorem, since \\\\( g(z) = e^z \\\\) is analytic everywhere in the complex plane except at infinity and if C and C' enclose the same poles with the same orientation without crossing any branch cuts (non-existent for \\\\( e^z \\\\)), the value of the integrals along C and C' will be the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "contour C → contour C'; contour C' → same poles; contour C' → same orientation; g(z) → f(z); C' → g(w); g(w) → f(z); contour C' → f(z); h(z) → intervention; g(z) → f(z) without intervention; f(z) without intervention → f(z) with intervention"
