  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where functions are transformed by Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We explore how integrating these transformations affects the plane's structures, examining the impact of tweaking the function by a constant linear shift \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) where c is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) in the form \\\\( G(s) = F(s) + \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the constant \\\\( c \\\\) used for the shift without extra information?",
  "Explanation": "While you can infer that a shift occurred and even determine the magnitude of the shift, \\\\( \\\\frac{c}{s} \\\\), the exact values of \\\\( c \\\\) and the uniqueness of the corresponding \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be determined without additional constraints or data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
