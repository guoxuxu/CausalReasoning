  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the function \\\\( V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI \\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(I\\\\) is current as a function of time. An integral transform (Laplace Transform) is applied to shift the problem into the complex frequency domain as \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and the transformed equation \\\\( V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) \\\\) is solvable without further external intervention, does it correctly reflect the time domain behavior modeled by \\\\( V(t) = L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, because the transform is linear and preserves differential relationships through transformation into the complex frequency domain, thus maintaining the cause-effect relationship accurately in the transformed domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
