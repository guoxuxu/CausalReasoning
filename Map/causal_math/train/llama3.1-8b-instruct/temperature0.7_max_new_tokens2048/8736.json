  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely identify the interventions (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( q(x) \\\\), or both) applied during the transformation, purely based on the observed value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences and combinations of interventions with matrices D and F, along with the transformation H, can result in the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The overlapping effects of these linear transformations and their exponential influences mean it's infeasible to identify the specifics of the interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
