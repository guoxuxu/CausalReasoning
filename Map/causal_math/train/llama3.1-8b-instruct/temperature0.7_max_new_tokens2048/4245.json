  "Problem": "Imagine a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the application of a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex constant, to investigate integral transformations and their effects.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the state obtained if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Qt}z_0 \\\\), affecting how the function evolves under the differential equation. The presence of \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) modifies the trajectory and so the end state at time T will differ unless \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) are specifically related to yield commutative effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
