  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined in a space, and a transformation given by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We will examine how the application of L and T impacts the outcomes over the function space.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x = x_1 \\\\) by applying a second transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int_0^x e^{kt} u(t) dt \\\\) (where k is another complex number), will the end state at \\\\( x = X \\\\) (for X > x_1) depend solely on the action of \\\\( L \\\\) and not on transformations \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( G \\\\) changes the function's state before \\\\( L \\\\) acts on it. Therefore, the endpoint state at \\\\( x = X \\\\) reflects the influence of both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\), in addition to the action of \\\\( L \\\\). This dependency complicates the system further, making the final state dependent on all applied operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
