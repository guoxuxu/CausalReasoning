  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), and assume a perturbation in the form of multiplication by a complex exponential, \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is an original signal and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency.\n\nCan we determine whether the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(s) \\\\) was calculated from a signal \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or from \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}h(t) \\\\) by observing the output transform at s = \\\\sigma only?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the presence of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), determining the function's origin from its transform at a single point s = \\\\sigma is ambiguous, as the same transform could result from different inputs due to shifts in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s → Laplace transform; perturbation (ω) → f(t); f(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → σ; σ → Laplace transform output; Laplace transform output → distinguishability; distinguishability → answer"
