  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain, with boundary conditions defined by the prescription \\\\(u = g\\\\) on the boundary. An integral transformation \\\\(f(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u dt\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, is considered over a period [0, T].\n\nWill the transformed function \\\\(f(u)\\\\) satisfy Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) throughout the domain after applying \\\\(f(u)\\\\) at t=0 and letting it evolve for time T?",
  "Explanation": "The original function \\\\(u\\\\) satisfying Laplace's equation does not necessarily imply that its integral transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) will also satisfy it. The operation of integration and matrix exponentials can introduce terms that do not necessarily satisfy Laplace's equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
