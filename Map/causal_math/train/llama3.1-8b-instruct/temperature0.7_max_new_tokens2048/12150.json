  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nIf a modification function \\\\( h(x) = x + \\cos(t) \\\\) is applied at a certain time t = T, will the future behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) beyond T depend entirely on the original \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the intervention \\\\( h(x) = x + \\cos(t) \\\\), the effects on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) post-intervention are strictly a result of the added cosine term and the ongoing progression of \\\\( t^2 \\\\). The function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), being separate and not interacting with the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), does not influence the outcome beyond T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
