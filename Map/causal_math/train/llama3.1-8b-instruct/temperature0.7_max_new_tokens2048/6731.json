  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant diffusivity. The rod undergoes a transformation due to a boundary condition change represented by \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at one end, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a constant.\n\nIf at a specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of an altered diffusivity constant \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, will the final temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial boundary condition transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The changing of the diffusivity constant \\\\( k \\\\) further complicates the influence of the initial condition transformation. The alteration affects how heat transfers post-intervention, making the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) a result of both the boundary condition and the new diffusivity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
