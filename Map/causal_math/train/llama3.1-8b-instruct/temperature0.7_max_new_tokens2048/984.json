  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely identify the interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(s) \\\\), \\\\( k(s) \\\\), or both) by observing modifications in \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations and modifications induced by \\\\( h(s) \\\\) and \\\\( k(s) \\\\) can overlap in effect depending on their mathematical characteristics and the specific values of \\\\( s \\\\), making it challenging to distinguish which function or combination thereof influenced \\\\( F(z) \\\\). Different intervention strategies might yield similar or indistinguishable outcomes in \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
