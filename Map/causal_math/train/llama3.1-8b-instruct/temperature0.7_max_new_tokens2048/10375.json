  "Problem": "We consider a system where the current at any time t in an electrical circuit is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\\\tau)}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( V(t) \\\\) represents the voltage source function. We also consider a time-dependent change in resistance modeled by the function \\\\( R(t) = 1 + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) affecting the voltage source.\n\nIf we adjust the system by applying an intervention that stabilizes resistance (\\\\( R(t) = R_0) \\\\) at a certain moment t_1, will the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and not on the original resistance function?",
  "Explanation": "The adjustment modifies the system's dynamics from t_1 onwards, changing how the voltage affects the current and the system’s history with its original varying resistance still influences \\\\( I(t) \\\\) up to t_1. Therefore, I(T) is affected by both the historical and intervened dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
