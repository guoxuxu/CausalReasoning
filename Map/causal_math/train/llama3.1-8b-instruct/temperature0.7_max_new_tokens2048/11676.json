  "Problem": "Investigate the influence of a linear operator transformation \\\\( z = L(x) \\\\) on a vector field \\\\( x \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The transformation L represents another linear operator with a constant matrix.\n\nBased on knowing only the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it feasible to precisely identify the transformations (L, H, or both) that were previously applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied based on the final vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is challenging due to the overlapping effects matrices may have in transforming the state space. The interactions of L and H with the matrix exponential of M can result in equivalent states from different transformation sequences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
