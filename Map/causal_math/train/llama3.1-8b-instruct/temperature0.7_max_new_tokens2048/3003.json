  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. The transformations used are \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and an external force represented by \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the characteristics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or the application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the external force \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) introduces a dependency on \\\\( h(t) \\\\), affecting the system's motion from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\). Furthermore, the earlier application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state, contributing additional complexity to the system’s behavior thereby making \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
