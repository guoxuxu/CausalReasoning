  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nIf we solve \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\) after pre-multiplying, will the solution vector \\\\( x \\\\) be the same as the solution to the original equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Pre-multiplying both sides of an equation by an invertible matrix M does not change the solution to the equation because it can be considered as a transformation that maintains the solution equivalence of the original system. The solution \\\\( x \\\\) remains unaffected since we can subsequently multiply by \\\\( M^{-1} \\\\) to revert to the original system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
