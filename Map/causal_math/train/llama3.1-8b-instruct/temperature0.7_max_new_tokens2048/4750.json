  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving through a vector field described by the velocity function \\\\( v(x, t) = Ax + h(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and h(t) is a time-dependent vector function. We explore the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{As}x ds \\\\) on the particle's trajectory.\n\nGiven the output trajectory \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we know that \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) was applied at the beginning, without assuming any other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) on the initial position integrates factors that depend on the matrix exponential, which are generally difficult to decompose uniquely without additional data about the system's parameters like A and h(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
