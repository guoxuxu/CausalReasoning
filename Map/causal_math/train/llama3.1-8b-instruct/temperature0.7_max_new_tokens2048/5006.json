  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nIs it possible to precisely identify the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial complex number was subjected to the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), it's impossible to conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) could have fundamentally changed its trajectory and final position at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
