  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) describes the evolution of a variable vector \\\\( z \\\\) through a linear transformation system in time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. Another function \\\\( w(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix, applies another linear transformation at an arbitrary time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the function without the application of \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( w(z) \\\\) alters the initial state to \\\\( w(z_0) = Cz_0 \\\\). The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from this new initial state, \\\\( e^{tA}(Cz_0) \\\\), generally differs from \\\\( e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) due to the presence of multiplication by \\\\( C \\\\), thus affecting the trajectory unless \\\\( C \\\\) commutes with \\\\( e^{tA} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
