  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) defined on complex numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( f \\) being a holomorphic function. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) concerning variable \\( y \\) and the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\) concerning variable \\( x \\) are used to analyze transformed functions.\n\nGiven the transforms \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\), can we uniquely reconstruct the original function \\( f(x, y) \\) without additional information on the order or method of transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the sequential order or specific details about the transformation techniques, reconstructing \\( f(x, y) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f\\}(w) \\) can be ambiguous. The non-uniqueness arises because different functions may yield the same transforms under certain conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
