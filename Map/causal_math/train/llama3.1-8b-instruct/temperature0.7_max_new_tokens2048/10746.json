  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) interacts with this dynamic over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time T, can we determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if no interventions have occurred?",
  "Explanation": "If no transformations or modifications have been applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), its initial form can be inferred from the Fourier transform since the Fourier transform directly reflects the frequency components of the original function. Hence, knowing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) allows reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
