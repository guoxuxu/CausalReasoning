  "Problem": "Consider a linear system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the implications of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the system, affecting the solution characteristics over time t.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the initial function into its frequency components, changing how the operator L acts on \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Since L may affect different frequency components variously, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T will not generally match the untransformed evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
