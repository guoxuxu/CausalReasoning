  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nBased on the outcome of \\( T(z)(T) \\), can we infer the original vector \\( z_0 \\) and whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The action of \\( f(z) \\), by modifying the initial conditions through complex exponentiation, obscures the original state \\( z_0 \\) and the precise nature of its phase shift. Without knowing the application of \\( f(z) \\), the original state cannot be uniquely determined from \\( T(z)(T) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
