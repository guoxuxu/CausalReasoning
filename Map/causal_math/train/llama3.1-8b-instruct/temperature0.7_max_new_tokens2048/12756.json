  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\), denoted \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\). We explore the implications of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\), whose transform is \\\\( H(s) \\), and its effect on the inverse transform \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is multiplied by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) in the transform space, yielding \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\), and this product is then inversely transformed without further intervention, does the resulting function match the convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) directly in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "The product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\) in the Laplace transform space corresponds exactly to the convolution \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\) in the time domain due to the convolution theorem. Thus, the inverse transform of \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\) will indeed yield the convolution of the original functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
