  "Problem": "Assume a complex function space governed by the Laplace equation \\( \\nabla^2 z = 0 \\), where \\( z \\) is a function of complex variable \\( x+iy \\). We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( T(u) \\) defined as \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}u(t) dt \\), applied to functions within this space.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(x+iy, T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations \\( T(u) \\), \\( G(v) \\), or both were applied at different times only by observing \\( z(x+iy, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint representation in complex function spaces, even under the Laplace equation, can result from differing initial states altered by different transformations, especially in integral formats that do not retain all original data. Therefore, interventions cannot be distinctly identified only through outcome observation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
