  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) with an initial input \\( z_0 \\). The system undergoes a transformation \\( h(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Et}z dt \\), where E is a constant matrix and T is the final time.\n\nIf \\( h(z) \\) is applied to the system at t = 0 and \\( z(t) \\) evolves under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) without further intervention, will the outcome \\( z(T) \\) be the same as if \\( z(t) \\) was propagated directly from \\( z_0 \\) to t = T under \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( h(z) \\) applies an integral operation, which affects the evolving state of \\( z(t) \\) by accumulating the impact of the matrix exponential \\( e^{Et} \\) over time. This results in a differently evolved state at time T, as the dynamics are altered by the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
