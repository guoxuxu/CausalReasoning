  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance Z represented by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \\\\). We analyze the circuit's response under the Laplace transformation of an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and applied to the circuit described by \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will the output in the s-domain, \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), solely be the product of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any other factors influencing the result?",
  "Explanation": "Without any other interventions, the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the s-domain is simply the product of the input Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the system's transfer function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), following the principle \\\\( Y(s) = X(s) Z(s) \\\\). This computation directly reflects the convolution in time domain corresponding to the linear system's response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
