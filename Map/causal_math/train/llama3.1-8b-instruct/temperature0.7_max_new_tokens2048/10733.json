  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers. We analyze the behavior of this function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = g(z) + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nWill the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) affect the convergence properties of the integral in the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) when applied without further modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the term \\\\( cz \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the behavior of the function, potentially shifting its region of convergence depending on the value of \\\\( c \\\\) and how it interacts with the original convergence criteria set by the integral in \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
