  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) applied to a constant vector \\( v \\) in the complex plane, where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex matrix. This scenario studies the effect of the function and the impact of an applied integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\), with \\( B \\) being another constant complex matrix.\n\nKnowing the transformation result \\( g(z) \\), can it be conclusively determined whether the function applied was \\( e^{At}v \\) or another function, assuming knowledge of \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of \\( B \\) and the outcome \\( g(z) \\), the specific function form \\( e^{At}v \\) cannot be exclusively confirmed. Variations in \\( A \\) or the vector \\( v \\), under similar transformation properties, could yield the same \\( g(z) \\), especially without specific data on how B interacts with different potential \\( A \\) matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
