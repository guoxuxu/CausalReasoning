  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to this function and then subsequently its inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we conclusively infer that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While it is true in mathematics that the inverse Laplace transform of the Laplace transform of a function should return the original function, confirmation that the specific function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) requires knowledge that no other transformations, additions, or modifications were made during the process. Other functions might have similar transforms depending on parameters and initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
