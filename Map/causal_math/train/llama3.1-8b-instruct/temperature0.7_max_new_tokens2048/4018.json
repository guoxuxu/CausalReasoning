  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\\\) applied to a function u(t). We study how applying another transformation \\\\( S[u](t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) either before or after T affects relations.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( y(x) = T[u](x) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( S \\\\) was applied prior to T?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the transformed function y(x) after T does not inherently reveal if S was applied. Both transformations (with or without applying S first) could lead to different original functions u that still produce the same resultant y under T, especially without more constraints on the initial u.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
