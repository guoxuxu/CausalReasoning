  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod varies with time and position, governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider an intervention represented by a heat source term \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) introduced at a position \\\\(x1\\\\) affecting the system.\n\nIf initially the temperature distribution is uniform, will the solution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) remain uniform over time without the intervention of additional heat sources?",
  "Explanation": "The uniform temperature distribution will evolve over time due to the diffusion term \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\). In the absence of any source, the heat will naturally diffuse according to its gradient, leading to changes in temperature distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
