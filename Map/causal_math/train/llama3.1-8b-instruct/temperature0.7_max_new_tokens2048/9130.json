  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) and we explore the functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\). We evaluate the behavior and causal inference scenarios of this function under various transformations and time periods.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\) at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\) without knowing the interim transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which includes squaring the integral and adding one, significantly alters the function such that reconstructing the original \\\\( z(x_0) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) is not feasible without knowing what transformations have been applied in between. The square and addition mask the original values of \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
