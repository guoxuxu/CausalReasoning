  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), defined on a bounded domain with Neumann boundary conditions. We focus on the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{pt}v(x) \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) solves the Laplace equation.\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T, k) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to determine directly which parameter (\\\\( p \\\\) or \\\\( q \\\\)) was used before and after the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T, k) \\\\), though indicative of changes, does not hold unique signatures of \\\\( p \\\\) or \\\\( q \\\\). Without explicit temporal markers or separate knowledge of the intervention dynamics, it is insurmountable to pinpoint the precise contribution of \\\\( p \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) thereafter just from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T, k) \\\\). Multiple combinations of parameters can result in similar transforms, leading to inherent ambiguity in backtracking the exact sequence of events or interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
