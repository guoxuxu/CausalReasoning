  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the system evolves according to the given PDE without further intervention, will the form of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to directly solving the PDE for u(x, T) and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution of the PDE directly yields the characteristic equations, which give \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-ikpt} \\\\). This result is identical whether the Fourier transform is applied initially or after evolution by the PDE, due to the linearity and shift properties of the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
