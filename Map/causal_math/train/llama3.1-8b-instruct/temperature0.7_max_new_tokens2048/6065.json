  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nIf the initial state is \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) without any transformation, will the value at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as with transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the function evolves solely based on the exponent \\\\( (a+bi) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies this by introducing a new exponent \\\\( (c+di) \\\\), which changes the evolution path and thus the value at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
