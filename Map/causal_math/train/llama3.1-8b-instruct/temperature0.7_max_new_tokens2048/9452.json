  "Problem": "Let's explore a system involving a stochastic variable X following the distribution \\(f_X(x) = e^{-x}\\) for \\(x > 0\\) and the integral transform \\(T[X] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx} f_X(x) dx\\). We're interested in evaluating the implications of changing the parameter \\(t\\) within the transform, specifically for \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nGiven the final value of \\(T[X]\\), can we specifically identify the chronological sequence of changes (if any) to \\(t\\), assuming initial or intermediate interventions occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing the resultant value of \\(T[X]\\), it is not feasible to unravel a complete series of chronological changes to \\(t\\) without additional data, due to the many potential pathways and \\(t\\) settings that could lead to the same end result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
