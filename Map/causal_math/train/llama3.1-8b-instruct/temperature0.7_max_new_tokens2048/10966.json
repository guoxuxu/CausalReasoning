  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), transitioning through the system defined by \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\), where c is a complex constant. This scenario examines causal inference in system's transformations and their reversibility.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the starting value \\\\(z_0\\\\) after observing the system at time T given the transformation \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves squaring the complex number, it can lead to multiple potential starting values (due to the nature of quadratic solutions), thereby not allowing a unique determination of \\\\(z_0\\\\) just by observing the result at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
