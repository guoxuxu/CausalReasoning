  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u\\\\) and investigate its implications over variable \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(F(u(z))\\\\), can we infer the specific form of the original function \\\\(u(z)\\\\) without knowing whether any preliminary transformations like \\\\(v(z) = e^{Bz}u(z)\\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge about preliminary transformations, reversing the Fourier transform will not necessarily retrieve the original \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Transformations such as \\\\(e^{Bz}\\\\) can significantly alter the spectral characteristics of \\\\(u(z)\\\\), affecting the invertibility and specificity of the original function recovery.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
