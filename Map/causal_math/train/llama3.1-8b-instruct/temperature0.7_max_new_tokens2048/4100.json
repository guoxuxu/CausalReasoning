  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) forming an RL circuit, subjected to a voltage \\( V(t) \\) described as a sinusoidal input \\( V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The response of the circuit is analyzed by examining the current \\( I(t) \\), and we analyze the effect of a transformation \\( f(I) = e^{st}I \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine exactly which interventions, \\( f(I) \\) and/or \\( g(I) \\), were applied based solely on the observed current \\( I(T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Several combinations of parameters \\( s \\) and \\( C \\) could yield the same final observed current due to overlapping effects and ambiguities in the exponential transformation interactions with the RL circuit response. Therefore, precise identification of interventions from \\( I(T) \\) is not feasible without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
