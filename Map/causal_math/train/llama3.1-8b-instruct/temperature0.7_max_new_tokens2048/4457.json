  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}x \\\\) where C is a complex function of a vector \\\\( x \\\\), and A is a constant matrix. The evolution of the function over time illustrates how x migrates through the transformation dictated by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and complex modulation by C.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starts with an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves without any further modifications under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + Cz\\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from its evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the complex function C modifies the usual exponential trajectory induced by A alone. The term \\\\( Cz \\\\) contributes additional growth or decay dynamics dependent on the properties of C, thus altering the trajectory from what would be obtained by \\\\( e^{At}x_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
