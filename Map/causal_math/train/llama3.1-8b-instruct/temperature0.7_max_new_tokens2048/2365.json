  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a matrix-based system with the equation \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(t) = P\\\\textbf{x}_0 + tQ\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\) are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x}) = e^{Rt}\\\\textbf{x}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) is another constant matrix, at various points in time.\n\nIf \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\) at T be different from applying the transformation at a later time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial conditions by the transformation \\\\(e^{R0}\\\\textbf{x}_0 = \\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\), which remains unchanged. However, applying it later alters the trajectory mid-course, affecting how subsequent contributions from \\\\(Q\\\\) influence the system’s evolution, leading to different states at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
