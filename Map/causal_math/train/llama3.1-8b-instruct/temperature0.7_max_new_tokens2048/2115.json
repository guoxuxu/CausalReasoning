  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) (where M is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The system, after being affected by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), does not only evolve according to D. The intervening application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory by introducing a new dynamic characterized by matrix M, thereby making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a compound result of D and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
