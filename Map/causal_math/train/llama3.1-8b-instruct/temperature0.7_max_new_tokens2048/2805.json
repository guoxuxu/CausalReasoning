  "Problem": "Consider the evolution of a complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) under transformation by integration against a kernel function \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\), where \\\\( z, s \\\\) are complex variables. The transformation is described by \\\\( w'(z) = \\\\int_D K(z, s) w(s) ds \\\\). Assume that \\\\( K \\\\) modifies how the function behaves in the domain differently based on its parameters.\n\nIf we initially apply the kernel transformation \\\\( K \\\\) to a function \\\\( w_0 \\\\) in domain \\\\( D \\\\) and let it evolve without further intervention, will the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at some point \\\\( z \\\\) in \\\\( D \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) directly evolved without applying \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel transformation \\\\( K \\\\) alters the initial functional state of \\\\( w \\\\) across the domain, impacting how \\\\( w \\\\) evolves within \\\\( D \\\\). Depending on the specific properties of \\\\( K \\\\), the final evolved state of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) can significantly differ from untransformed progression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
