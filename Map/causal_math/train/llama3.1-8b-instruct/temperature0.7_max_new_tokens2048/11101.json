  "Problem": "Investigate a system characterized by the continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of a signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), denoted as \\\\(X(f)\\\\). Explore how the multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\(f_0\\\\) is a frequency offset, affects the transform.\n\nBy modifying the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) to \\\\(x(t)e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) at t = 0 and then calculating the CTFT, will the spectrum \\\\(X(f)\\\\) simply shift by \\\\(f_0\\\\) in frequency without any additional changes?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in time domain corresponds to a frequency shift in the Fourier domain. This is a direct application of the modulation property of the Fourier transform, which states that multiplying a time-domain signal by a complex exponential results in a frequency shift of its spectrum by \\\\(f_0\\\\) without altering the shape or amplitude distribution of the spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
