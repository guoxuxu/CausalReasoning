  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. We analyze the behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, is the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved using the original differential equations to t = T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the trajectory of both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), changing the resultant complex function states at any time t. Therefore, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not align with the state reached had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) not undergone initial transformation by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
