  "Problem": "Consider the complex plane where functions are mapped using a transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) indicates time. Analyze the impact of this transformation under the integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), reflecting a periodic adjustment over time T.\n\nIf at some instance \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention alters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the resultant output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time T depend only on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), ignoring the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) during the transformation process due to the intervention distinctly affects the integral transformation outcome by altering the frequency of oscillations, and thus impacts the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
