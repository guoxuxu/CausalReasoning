  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t, satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's behavior using the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a particular s after an intervention, can we determine what the intervention was (value of d) simply by analyzing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) could potentially correspond to different scenarios depending on the timing and magnitude of the intervention d. Since interventions modify the state uniquely based on their timing and scale, the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is not sufficient to backtrack and determine the specific details of the intervention precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
