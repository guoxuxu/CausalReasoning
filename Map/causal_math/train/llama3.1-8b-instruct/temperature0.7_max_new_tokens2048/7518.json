  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) defined in the complex plane and let \\\\(F(s)\\\\) denote the Laplace transform of \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is a real-valued function that corresponds to the real part of \\\\(f(z)\\\\). We examine behaviors when \\\\(z\\\\) traverses along different paths in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) at a specific point, can we infer the specific path in the Z-plane \\\\(z\\\\) took – whether it was linear or circular?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace transforms reflect aggregate properties of the function over time and do not retain path-specific information of the traversal in the Z-plane. Different paths can lead to the same transform, especially if the function holds certain symmetries or if the endpoints are the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
