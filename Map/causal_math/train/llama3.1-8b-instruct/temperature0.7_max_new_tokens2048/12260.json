  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without any other intervention, will the Laplace transform at some different parameter \\\\( s' \\\\) give the same result as if no initial transformation were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) changes the function from its natural time domain into a frequency domain representation which fundamentally alters subsequent behavior under the differential equation activating non-equivalent dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
