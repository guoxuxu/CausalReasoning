  "Problem": "Examine a complex function's behavior under transformation with the Laplace Transform, where the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). Consider the transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf at an intermediate point in the transformation process a modifying function \\\\( h(s) = s/(s^2 + 1) \\\\) is applied to the Laplace domain representation \\\\( f(s) \\\\), will the resulting time-domain function \\\\( g''(z) \\\\) be only dependant on the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the modifying function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) changes the function in the Laplace domain. As such, the resulting time-domain function upon applying the inverse transform would be influenced not only by the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\) but also due to the effects introduced by \\\\( h(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
