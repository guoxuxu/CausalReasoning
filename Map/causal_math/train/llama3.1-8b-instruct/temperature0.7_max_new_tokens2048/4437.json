  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is driven by a voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\). The relationship is governed by a linear differential equation involving a convolution with the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) of the circuit. We analyze how the response changes if we modify the signal using a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{V(t)\\\\} = \\\\tilde{V}(s) \\\\), apply a filter defined by a function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then take the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{ F(s)\\\\tilde{V}(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is directly applied to the circuit and allowed to evolve without applying the transform and filter, will the resulting \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at some time T be the same as if \\\\( V(t) \\\\) had been transformed, filtered, and then inverse-transformed before being applied?",
  "Explanation": "The direct application of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) leads to a response based solely on the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Applying the Laplace transform, modifying by \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then taking the inverse adds a filtering process that fundamentally alters the input signal's spectrum, thereby changing the resultant current \\\\( I(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
