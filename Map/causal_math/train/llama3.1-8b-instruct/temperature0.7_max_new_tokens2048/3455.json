  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We investigate the effect of applying an initial temperature distribution using the transformation \\\\( u(x, 0) = \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant.\n\nSuppose at a specific time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) another heating method modifies the distribution to \\\\( u(x, t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\\\sin(\\\\beta x) \\\\) as an intervention. Will the temperature distribution at \\\\( t = T \\\\), where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), solely depend on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and not be influenced by the nature of this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a cooling factor \\\\( e^{-t_1} \\\\) modifies the temperature profile at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and affects how the distribution evolves thereafter under the heat equation. This intervention will influence the distribution at \\\\( t = T \\\\), making it dependent not just on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) but also on the characteristics and timing of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
