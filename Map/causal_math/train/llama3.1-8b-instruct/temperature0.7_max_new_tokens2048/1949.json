  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) applied to a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), especially focusing on integrating this transform into a control system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is a control input function.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) creating \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s)\\\\), and then it is used as part of the control input in the system without further intervention, does the resulting state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) follow the same trajectory as it would without using the Laplace Transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace Transform to the control function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and its subsequent usage in the control system fundamentally alters the characteristics of the input, often smoothing or modifying response behaviors due to the transform properties. This generally results in a different trajectory or behavior of the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
