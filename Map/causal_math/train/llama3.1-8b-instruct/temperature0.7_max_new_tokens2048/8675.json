  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a variable transformation using a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) on the integration path in the complex plane. Given a continuous function g(z), we examine the integral transformation from the function \\\\( \\\\int g(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over a specific path P to \\\\( \\\\int g(f(z))f'(z)\\\\, dz \\\\) over the same path.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied during the integrals calculation changing the path to Q, does this ensure that the endpoint results of \\\\( \\\\int g(f(h(z)))h'(z)f'(h(z))\\\\, dz \\\\) will depend only on the functions g and f?",
  "Explanation": "The added transformation with \\\\( h(z) \\\\), which affects both the integrand and the path, introduces another layer of complexity. The final integral is now dependent on additional modifications brought by the new path and the squared transformation, profoundly impacting the end results alongside the original g and f functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
