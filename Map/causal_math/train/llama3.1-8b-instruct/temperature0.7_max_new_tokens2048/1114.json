  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we infer the exact form of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the characteristics of the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), multiple different input signals could potentially produce the same output due to the modifications imposed by the unknown filter in the frequency domain. The problem lacks a unique inversion unless additional information about \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → Fourier transform → H(s); H(s) → Filtered signal → Inverse Fourier transform → y(t); y(t) → Input signal x(t) via H(s)"
