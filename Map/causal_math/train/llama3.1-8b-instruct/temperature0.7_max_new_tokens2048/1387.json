  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)](s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) + i\\\\mathcal{L}[v(t)](s) \\\\). We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = az + b \\\\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where c and d are complex constants) is applied after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), before taking the Laplace Transform, will the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still exhibit effects from the first transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation modifies the already altered function, and both transformations leave their respective impacts on the transformed function. The final result depends on the composition of these transformations, reflecting both modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
