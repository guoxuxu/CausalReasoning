  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is an input vector. The evolution over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) also being constant matrices.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we identify precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), \\\\( E^{Ft}z \\\\), or both), based only on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various sequences or types of interventions. Given the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials and their non-commutative properties, pinpointing specific interventions from the endpoint alone becomes infeasible without additional information about the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
