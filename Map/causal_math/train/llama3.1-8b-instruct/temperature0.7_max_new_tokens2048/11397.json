  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We investigate the implications of imposing the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) at time t, where D is also a constant matrix, and analyzing the system's evolution.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is implemented on a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) will modify the initial condition from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\), which alters the trajectory. Even if C and D commute, the exponential growth factors induced by matrix C applied to \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\) will generate a different outcome compared to simply evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
