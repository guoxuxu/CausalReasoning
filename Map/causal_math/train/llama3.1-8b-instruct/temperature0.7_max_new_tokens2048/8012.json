  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both interventions were applied just by knowing the outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) can potentially arise from various combinations or sequences of interventions due to overlapping effects of linear transformations and constant adjustments. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely ascertain which transformations were applied to reach a specific final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
