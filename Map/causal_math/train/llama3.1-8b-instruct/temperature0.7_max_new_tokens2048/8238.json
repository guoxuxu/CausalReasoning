  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx + Nu \\\\), with M and N as constant matrices representing the system dynamics and control input respectively. We consider the role of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = k^Tx \\\\) applied at different times, where k is a constant matrix and T denotes the transpose.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we retroactively determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) precisely without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is ambiguous whether the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolved from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( k^T x_0 \\\\). This uncertainty about the initial modification precludes exact back-calculation of \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
