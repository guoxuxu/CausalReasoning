  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sw}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a function and \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x(s)e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nBased on the final result of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) after multiple interventions (multiplying \\\\( x(s) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{as} \\\\) and later by \\\\( e^{bs} \\\\)), can we deduce all the types and timings of these interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the incremental introduction of factors and the inherent properties of the integral transformation, the final \\\\( z(w) \\\\) does not retain distinct signatures of the sequence or timing of interventions. The problem of deconvoluting these contributions without prior knowledge of their occurrence or additional constraints is underdetermined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
