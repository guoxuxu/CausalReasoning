  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), on this function and analyzing its impact on the system's dynamics.\n\nGiven a scaled Laplace Transform result, is it possible to deduce that a scaling intervention was applied without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the scaled Laplace Transform indicates a change in amplitude, without prior knowledge about the original amplitude or the specific nature of any interventions, it is impossible to conclusively determine whether a scaling was applied. Multiple potential interventions or initial conditions could yield similar transform results, thus obscuring the precise nature of any interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
