  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) with the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and then the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\) with no further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T still reflect the initial transformation by \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = 0 simplifies to zero as it includes no integration range, leaving the system to evolve purely under the harmonic oscillator's dynamics. The time evolution is solely governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), thus \\\\( F(z) \\\\) initially has no effect on the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
