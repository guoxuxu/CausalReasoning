  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a continuous function on the interval [0, T], and s is a complex scalar. We are interested to determine how transformations to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) like \\\\( f(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is another continuous function, impacts the resulting function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) computed with interventions at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adding \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we uniquely identify if \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or another function was added just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be obtained through the addition of various different functions during the interval, and without additional information about the specific transformation or the nature of the interventions at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), it is not possible to infer the exact function added.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
