  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics of a particle moving in a potential field given by \\( V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. The motion is subject to an external force \\( F(t) \\), and the differential equation governing the motion is \\( m\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{dV}{dx} + F(t) \\), where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\nKnowing only the position \\( x(T) \\) at time \\( T \\), can we determine if there was an intervention in the form of a change in the spring constant?",
  "Explanation": "The position \\( x(T) \\) cannot uniquely confirm an intervention such as a change in the spring constant due to potential ambiguity from the interplay of initial conditions, \\( F(t) \\), and equivalent dynamical responses that can result from different configurations of \\( k \\) and \\( F(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
