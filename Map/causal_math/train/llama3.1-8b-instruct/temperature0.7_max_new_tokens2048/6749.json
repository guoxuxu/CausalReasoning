  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), where x and y are real variables, and i is the imaginary unit. This system is subjected to the transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of the system is analyzed in a scenario where transformations are applied and the system evolves over time.\n\nIf \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) initially, and then we observe the outcome without any further intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the transformation dictated by K?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\) applied initially determines the state of the system directly through the equation without any other external influences altering its evolution, reflecting a direct dependency on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
