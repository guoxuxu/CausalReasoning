  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature inside a chamber, denoted as T(t), evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T_a - T)\\\\), with T_a being the ambient temperature and k a positive constant. An intervention is introduced by adjusting T_a through a function \\\\( f(t) = T_a + \\\\Delta T_a \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), modifying the ambient temperature periodically.\n\nIf the ambient temperature T_a is modified using the function f(t) at time t, will the chamber temperature T(t) at any later time T depend solely on the original ambient temperature T_a0, ignoring the effects of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies T_a periodically, which affects the differential equation governing T(t). Consequently, the dynamics and final state of T will depend not only on T_a0 but also significantly on \\\\(\\\\Delta T_a\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), the parameters of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
