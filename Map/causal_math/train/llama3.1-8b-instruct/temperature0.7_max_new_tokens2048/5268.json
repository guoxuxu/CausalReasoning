  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions (particularly, the nature of function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)) were used at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just by examining \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the transformed state provides information about the presence of an intervention through changes in the system, the specific nature or type of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is obscured by the subsequent evolution and potential overlap with effects from the differential operator. Identification of precise interventions requires additional constraints or information about the intervening function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
