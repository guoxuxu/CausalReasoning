  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), with \\( M \\) being a complex matrix. Investigate how the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), affects the dynamics of \\( z(t) \\), where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable.\n\nGiven the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\), can we conclusively trace back to compute \\( Z(s) \\) without knowing the initial condition \\( z(0) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\( Z(s) \\) from \\( z(t) \\) at a single time point \\( T \\) is insufficient without additional data such as \\( z(0) \\). \\( Z(s) \\) encompasses the entire time-dependent behavior of \\( z(t) \\), not just a snapshot, making it indeterminable from limited time-specific information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
