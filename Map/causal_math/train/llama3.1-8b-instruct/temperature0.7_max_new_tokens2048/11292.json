  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We're evaluating the effect of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}s ds \\\\) applied to a function z(t), where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that some intervention was used, can we determine precisely which operations were applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) involve integrals of exponential functions, which can create similar effects depending on the properties of matrices D and E. Without explicit knowledge of the intervention timing or specific matrix used, distinguishing the precise operations from the end state alone is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
