  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function z(t) defined as z(t) = e^{At}w, where A is a complex constant matrix, and w is a complex vector. The function represents the evolution of z over time under the influence of matrix A, and we are interested in how various transformations, represented by another complex matrix B, affect this evolution.\n\nIf at t = 0 the function f(z) = Bz is applied to the vector w, and the system is then allowed to evolve under e^{At} without further intervention, will z(t) at t = T adhere strictly to the path defined by e^{At}Bw?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation f(z) = Bz initially and then allowing the system to evolve under e^{At} results in z(t) = e^{At}Bw at any later time T. This outcome directly follows the sequence of transformations without deviation, as the initial transformation by B and the continuous evolution under A define a unique trajectory for z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
