  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nIf an additional sink is introduced at a point not at the origin, represented by \\\\( -\\\\frac{\\\\kappa'}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z - a) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex shift, will the overall flow structure at a large distance from the origin be independent of the sink's influence?",
  "Explanation": "At large distances, the logarithmic influence of a sink diminishes, and the primary flow characteristics become dominated by the uniform flow component \\\\( Uz \\\\). The localized effect of the sink around its immediate vicinity does not significantly affect the far-field flow patterns, which are dictated by the uniform flow.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
