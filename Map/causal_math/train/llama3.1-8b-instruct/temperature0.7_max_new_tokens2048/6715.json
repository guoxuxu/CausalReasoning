  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant, at different points in time.\n\nIf at time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) introduces additional complexity and dependence on both \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from compounded transformations by \\\\( C \\\\) then \\\\( D \\\\), making it dependent on these parameters along with \\\\( A \\\\). The trajectory changes based on both the original and intermediate transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
