  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. The function is initially transformed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, without knowing the initial conditions directly?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the state at time T, we cannot definitively ascertain whether the initial state was modified by \\\\( f(u) \\\\). This is due to the inherent properties of the heat equation where different initial conditions might converge to similar states at T, especially as the heat distribution stabilizes or certain features of the transformed state become less distinguishable over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
