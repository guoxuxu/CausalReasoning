  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent field described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax - By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's responses to transformations given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex scalar.\n\nBased solely on the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential for each transformation to independently alter both the amplitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in non-trivial ways, multiple combinations of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This overlap makes it impossible to conclusively determine the specific interventions used during the process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
