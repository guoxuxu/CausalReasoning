  "Problem": "Examine the causal relationship in a scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes various transformations. Initially, we have a Fourier transform applied to the signal, \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\). Afterwards, we evaluate the impact using a filter function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which might be an intervention in the frequency domain.\n\nIf at some point after the Fourier transform, the frequency response \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is modified by applying a filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the final output signal still solely depend on the spectrum of the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) fundamentally alters the frequency components of the signal post-Fourier transform. The final output is thereby influenced by both the filter characteristics and the original signal spectrum, making it dependent on the filter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
