  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), a basic wave equation where \\\\(c\\\\) is the velocity of wave propagation. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L\\\\) affects the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\), specifically when considering boundary conditions and time transformations.\n\nGiven the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x, s)\\\\) at \\\\(s = S\\\\), can we determine explicitly whether an external force was applied, and its form, only by analyzing the coefficients of \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x, s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed solution \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(x, s)\\\\) encodes information about initial conditions, the equation's parameters, and any applied interventions. Isolating the effect of a specific intervention like an external force demands more information about when and how the force was implemented. Since multiple configurations of forces could lead to the same modifications in the Laplace space coefficients, deducing the exact nature of any interventions accurately from these coefficients alone is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
