  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) on this function, specifically, the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the transformed function\\\\( T[z'](s) \\\\), can we definitively determine the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) before intervention, solely based on knowledge of \\\\( T[z'](s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( T[z'](s) \\\\) after intervention reveals the frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) of the modified function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\). However, information about the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is lost in the process, as the transform does not retain any information about past states or frequencies after such modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
