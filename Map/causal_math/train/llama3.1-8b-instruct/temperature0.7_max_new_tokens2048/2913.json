  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf performing a Fourier transform on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( F(a)(x) = \\\\frac{1}{a + ix} \\\\), will applying the transform on the same \\\\( f(t) \\\\) always yield the same output if there is no intervention in the system?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) being deterministic and depend solely on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) under constant conditions of \\\\( a \\\\) and without any external intervention maintains consistent results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
