  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which transcribes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation is applied, such as \\\\( T[f](t)=\\\\int_0^t f(s) e^{s} ds \\\\), affecting the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) is applied at time t = t1, will the resultant function at t = T solely depend on the original function without considering the effects of transformations T and U?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of yet another transformation, \\\\( U \\\\), introduces further alterations, making the resultant state dependent on both transformations T and U, alongside the basic dynamics of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This layers the effects and modifies the trajectory substantially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
