  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We will examine how changes in the time domain function affect its Laplace transform and vice versa, taking into account voluntary interventions in the form of derivative operations.\n\nIf an operator \\\\( G(t) = t^k \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer, is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at some point before transforming to the Laplace domain, will the resultant \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend solely on the original function without considering the effect of \\\\( t^k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( t^k \\\\) multiplies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( t^k \\\\) which modifies its original form. This change directly affects the Laplace transform, introducing terms related to the derivatives of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as well as multiplication by \\\\( s^{-k} \\\\), influencing the overall transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
