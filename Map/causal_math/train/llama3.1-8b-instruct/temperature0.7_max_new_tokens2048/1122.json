  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this function, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformations were performed post Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), under the assumption that no transformations were applied after calculating it, one can uniquely recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform, which is uniquely defined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
