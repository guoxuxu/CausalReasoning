  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{At}s \\, ds \\\\), where A is a complex number. To analyze the behavior, an intervention by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is also a complex number, is considered over time t.\n\nGiven that a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is implemented at a time t_1, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the subsequent evolution path of z. Therefore, both A and B influence the resulting state at T, as the transformation impacts how the integral proceeds beyond t_1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
