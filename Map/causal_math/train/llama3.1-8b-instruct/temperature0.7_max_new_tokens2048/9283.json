  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf an operation defined by another transform, say Laplace, is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(T_1\\\\), will the final form of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > \\\\(T_1\\\\) be independent of the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation such as the Laplace transform at time \\\\(T_1\\\\) further alters the evolution of the original function u(x, t). The final state at time T depends on both transformations, making the system’s behavior from T1 to T dependent on the compounded effects of both the Fourier and Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
