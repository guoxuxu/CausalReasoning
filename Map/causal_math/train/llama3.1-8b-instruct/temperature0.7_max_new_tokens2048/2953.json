  "Problem": "Consider a complex function analysis where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied to a function in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system's dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) alters the initial state by adding a phase shift that rotates the complex number in the complex plane. This rotation changes the trajectory of the future states under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), leading to a different complex number at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
