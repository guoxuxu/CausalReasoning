  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of impulse action in a heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) on a domain \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative of u, and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian. The intervention is represented by applying a function \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\delta(x-x_0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( x_0 \\\\).\n\nAssuming an impulse is added at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and location \\\\( x_0 \\\\) as defined by \\\\( g(u) \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > \\\\( t_0 \\\\) solely depend on the form of the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and not on \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the impulse adds a singular source term at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) which affects the solution thereafter. Consequently, the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) depends on the initial state, the magnitude of the impulse \\\\( h \\\\), and its location \\\\( x_0 \\\\) as well as the properties of the diffusion defined by the Laplacian.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
