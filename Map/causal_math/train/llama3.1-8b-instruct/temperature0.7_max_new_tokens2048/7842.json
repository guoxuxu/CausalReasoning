  "Problem": "Examine a control system defined by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix and \\(D\\) is the control input matrix. The analysis covers the impact of a non-linear transformation \\( h(x) = \\sin(Kt) x \\) on the system's state \\(x\\), over time \\(t\\), where \\(K\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely recover the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\( h(x) \\), we cannot determine if the observed state \\( x(t) \\) at time T arose from a simple linear control evolution or was initially scaled by a sinusoidal factor, as \\(\\sin(Kt)\\) could fundamentally obscure or transform the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
