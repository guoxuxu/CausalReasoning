  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Assume the dynamic of the function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), with M being a constant 2x2 real matrix.\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing that an intervention may have occurred, can we definitively discern whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both were applied during the evolution up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both M and N contribute through matrix exponentials and can modify the system's trajectory in potentially overlapping ways, we cannot conclusively determine which interventions were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The ability of exponential transformations to mirror or mask each other's effects provides insufficient information to uniquely identify the path of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
