  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ y(t) \\\\} = Y(s) \\\\) with a convolution operation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-kt} \\\\), where k is a constant. The impact of initial and intermediate alterations using the convolution operation is studied.\n\nWith the observation of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine which functions (either \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both) were convolved, solely based on \\\\( Y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform at \\\\( Y(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of convolutions with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\). As convolution results in multipliable transforms and because the exact time and sequence of convolution affects the final state, mere observation at T cannot distinguish between the functions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
