  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{tx} \\\\) in the complex plane. We evaluate the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(x,t) \\\\) at different circumstances. The constant \\\\( t \\\\) represents time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(x, t) \\\\) is computed for a given complex number \\\\( x \\\\) at an initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve by its inherent properties without additional transformations for a duration T, will the result at time \\\\( T \\\\) be a simple Laplace transform of \\\\( z(x,0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inherent time evolution of \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{tx} \\\\) alters its behavior over time, and the result at time \\\\( T \\\\) is not merely the Laplace transform of its initial state at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) due to the exponential factor involving both \\\\( t \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\), which modifies the entire function's behavior over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
