  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) being a function evolving under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. Consider the role of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and how it interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we conclusively trace back to the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) when considering the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) encodes frequency content from the entire time evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), but it does not preserve detailed phase or initial state information in a unique manner due to potential overlaps in the frequency domain representations of different initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
