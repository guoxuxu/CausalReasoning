  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of applying an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(h) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}h(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and T is a fixed time.\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( g(h) \\\\) after it has been subjected to the additional functional modulation by \\\\( f(h) \\\\), can we clearly determine whether the original function was \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) or a different function, based solely on the information of the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations applied through \\\\( g(h) \\\\) and \\\\( f(h) \\\\), and their respective integrations, can significantly alter and mask the original nature of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The nonlinear interactions and the integrations affected by \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) generate multiple possible original functions that could lead to the same transformed endpoint, especially without distinct markers to differentiate between them.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
