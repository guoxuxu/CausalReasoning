  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The role of the Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) on this system is analyzed.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the constants \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) in the original differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the algebraic form of the Laplace transform of the differential equation. The function's s-domain form directly depends on these parameters, allowing their values to be extracted by evaluating the relations given by the transformed equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
