  "Problem": "Consider a model described by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function. An external influence is introduced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) solely from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of the parameters \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), and different initial conditions. The interplay of the exponential growth or decay and the rotational dynamics can lead to multiple possible scenarios producing the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it challenging to uniquely identify the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
