  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at z = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at z = Z be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to z = Z under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\( f(0) w_0 = e^{K*0}w_0 = w_0 \\\\), however, the character of the progression for any \\\\( z \\neq 0 \\\\) alters as \\\\( e^{Kz} \\\\) non-trivially affects the evolutionary path due to non-commutativity of matrix exponentiation with M differential operator, thereby altering what \\\\( w(z) \\\\) would have been without such an application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
