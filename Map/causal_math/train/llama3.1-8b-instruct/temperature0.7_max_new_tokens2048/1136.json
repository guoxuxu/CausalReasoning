  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf the only observed data is the non-zero spectrum at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) from the Fourier transform, can we definitively conclude that the phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a non-zero value at \\\\( \\\\omega' = \\\\omega \\\\) indicates that the original function contains the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). However, from this information alone, we cannot ascertain whether a phase shift was applied, as the spectrum does not provide direct insights into phase changes without additional phase-specific data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
