  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0 \\\\) where a is a constant. Let's explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t)) \\\\) on this equation over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, 0) \\\\) without knowing how the transformation might have been first applied?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) under the transformed equation can be uniquely reversed back to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, 0) \\\\) since the Fourier transform establishes a one-to-one mapping between the temporal evolution of the original and the transformed function, assuming no external modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
