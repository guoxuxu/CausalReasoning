  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = ze^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation and its ability to highlight causality within the calculations.\n\nIf initially the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is modified by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), and this new function evolves without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of the resulting function at s points be equivalent to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the original function to \\\\( f(z)g(z) = z^3e^{z} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z^3e^{z}\\\\}(s) \\\\) will differ from \\\\( F(s) \\\\), leading to distinct behavior in the s-domain. The input modification impacts the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
