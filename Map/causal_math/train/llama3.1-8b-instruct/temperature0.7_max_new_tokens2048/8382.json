  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) is defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix, impacts the system over a period of time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the input complex number \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\), it's impossible to backtrack the initial conditions exactly due to the transformation potentially altering the trajectory in a way that is not reversible, especially because the matrix exponential may skew or rotate the positions in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
