  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the causal influences when we alter \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a multiplier \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and evolves under the defined integral transformation without further modification, will the transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be the same as it was before modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) shifts the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the Laplace domain. This frequency shift translates to a modification in the value of \\\\( s \\\\) to \\\\( s-i\\\\omega \\\\) in the integral expression of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), leading to a different outcome of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
