  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We study the effect of the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse transformation using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) rather than \\\\( a \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is taken and then the inverse Laplace transform is applied with the original parameter \\\\( a \\\\), will the final expression for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time domain remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse using the same parameter \\\\( a \\\\) completely recovers the original function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the complex domain, thus remaining unchanged in the time domain representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
