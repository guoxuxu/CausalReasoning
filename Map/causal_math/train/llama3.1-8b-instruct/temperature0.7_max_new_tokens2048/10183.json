  "Problem": "Consider the impact of different transform kernels in an integral transformation on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Define transform kernels \\\\( K(t, x) = e^{At} \\\\) and intervention kernels \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, on the analysis of the function over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new kernel \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting function at t = T (for T > t_1) depend solely on the initial kernel \\\\( K \\\\) and not on the intervention with \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the kernel \\\\( L(t, x) = e^{Bt} \\\\) introduces an additional transformational factor to the function's evolution. The final state of the function at t = T is influenced by both kernels, not just the initial kernel \\\\( K \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
