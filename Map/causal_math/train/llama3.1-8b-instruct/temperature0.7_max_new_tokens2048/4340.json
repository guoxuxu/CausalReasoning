  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is a constant vector. We evaluate the impact of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations of the transformations due to non-commutative matrix operations and similar resulting state trajectories. This overlap makes it impossible to conclusively pinpoint which transformations were applied just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
