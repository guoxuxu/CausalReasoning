  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. This function is subjected to an integral transform, specifically a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{iat} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) at a certain time before applying the Fourier transform, will \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) solely reflect the original frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) \\\\cdot e^{iat} = e^{i(w+a)t} \\\\). The Fourier transform will then shift to \\\\( \\\\omega = w + a \\\\), indicating an altered frequency spectrum due to the intervention, and thus not solely reflecting the original frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
