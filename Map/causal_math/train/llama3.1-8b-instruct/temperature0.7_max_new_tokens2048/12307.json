  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nCan we precisely identify which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied by only observing the system's final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and their timings (B and C values) could potentially lead to the same final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), due to the rotational symmetries and the possibility of overlaps in the outcomes generated by different sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
