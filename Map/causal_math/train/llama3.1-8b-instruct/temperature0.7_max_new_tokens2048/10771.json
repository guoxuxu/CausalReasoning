  "Problem": "Consider a model where the temperature change in a material over time is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source is introduced via a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function representing the heat input.\n\nIf an additional cooling process \\\\( g(u) = u - c(t) \\\\), where \\\\( c(t) \\\\) is another time-dependent function, is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the heat source function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will depend on the cumulative effects of both the heating and cooling functions (\\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( c(t) \\\\)), along with the original thermal diffusion process. This is because both interventions alter the temperature distribution at different times and in potentially opposing ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
