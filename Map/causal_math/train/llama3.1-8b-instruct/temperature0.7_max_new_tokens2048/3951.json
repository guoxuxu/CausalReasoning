  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nIf another linear operator M is applied to x before forming g(t) such that ŷ(t) = e^(At)Mx and then performing L{ŷ(t)}, will L{ŷ(t)} still equal (sI - A)^-1 * x?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation M to x alters the initial conditions forming ŷ(t) = e^(At)Mx. Subsequent application of the Laplace Transform on ŷ(t) leads to L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx, which differs from L{g(t)} because of the inclusion of M, hence affecting the outcome of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
