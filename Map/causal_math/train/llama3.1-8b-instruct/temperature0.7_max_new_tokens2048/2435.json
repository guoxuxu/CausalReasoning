  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a system described by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where f(t) represents a function of time t. We explore the transformations of this function through multiplication by another function g(t), and how it impacts the system using another transform, the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\lambda t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} \\\\) at t = T be independent of the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied in the Laplace setting?",
  "Explanation": "The new function h(t) still consists of f(t), albeit modified, and hence the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} \\\\) is influenced not only by the original structure of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) but also by any impacts that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) had on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before the intervention. This dependency introduces variability that makes \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) contingent on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
