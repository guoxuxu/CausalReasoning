  "Problem": "Consider a system where temperature distribution over a rod is described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a diffusion constant. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could potentially be the result of various combinations of initial Fourier transformations and linear interventions. These effects are not easily separable based on the final state alone, especially without explicit knowledge of the interventions used.",
