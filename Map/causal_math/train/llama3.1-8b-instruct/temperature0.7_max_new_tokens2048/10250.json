  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The impact of a transformation, defined by \\\\( g(z) = R(t)z \\\\) where \\\\( R(t) = e^{iNt} \\\\) (N being a constant complex matrix) on the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied.\n\nCan we categorically determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the functioning of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the modification introduced by the transformation through \\\\( e^{iNt} \\\\), which might have changed initial conditions, precludes accurate back-calculation to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the non-commutativity and exponential influence of N with M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
