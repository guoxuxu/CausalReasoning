  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing a system's state over time. The system is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we specify whether the intervention involved a delta function modification at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), solely from the value of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integrated nature of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) may mask the specific effects of interventions like a delta function at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making it difficult to pinpoint such changes from the final state alone. Multiple potential interventions could result in similar values of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
