  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the role of the integral transformation \\\\(T(u) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} u(t) \\, dt\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u(t)\\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\(u(0)\\\\) evolves according to the PDE \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) without further manipulation, will the Laplace transform \\\\(T(u)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be equivalent to performing the same transform after the function has evolved naturally?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) under the PDE and the subsequent application of the Laplace transform \\\\(T(u)\\\\) are sequential and independent operations that commute. The natural evolution through \\\\(Lu\\\\) followed by the transform will give the same result as the transform of the naturally evolved function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
