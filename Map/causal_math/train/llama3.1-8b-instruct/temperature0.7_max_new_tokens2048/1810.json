  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nGiven the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\), can we determine the specific value of \\\\( a \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The value of the integral alone, especially in complex function contexts, does not uniquely determine \\\\( a \\\\), as different values can lead to the same integral due to the periodic properties of the exponential function and the specific geometry of C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
