  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the causal relationships when manipulating the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and analyzing its impact on the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using different transformations.\n\nIf an input function \\\\( x(t) = t \\\\) is directly applied into the integral transformation without any modifications, will the resultant output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uniquely determine \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from 0 to t?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation via integral over time compresses multiple possible inputs into a single output state, thus information about specific aspects of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be lost due to integration over the complex exponential, which does not uniquely encode all properties of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
