  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i \\\\theta}z\\\\) acts on a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) in the complex plane. Here, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a real number representing a rotation angle. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\) for dynamics given by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant, is considered.\n\nIf at \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(z) = e^{i \\\\phi}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is another rotation angle) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is affected by both rotations, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), in addition to the dynamical evolution due to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The interventions modify the trajectory by adding rotations, which influences the final position on the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
