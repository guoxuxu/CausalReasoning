  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation of the form \\\\( y(x) = \\int_0^x K(x, t) y(t) dt + f(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a known function. We analyze the changes in function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) when a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) characterized by operator \\\\( L[y] = y + g \\\\), where \\\\( g \\\\) is an additional function, is applied to the integral equation.\n\nCan we determine the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) used in the original equation after observing \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) requires precise knowledge of the initial conditions and transformations applied. Without certainty about the application of \\\\( L \\\\), the additional term \\\\( g \\\\) in \\\\( L \\\\) could significantly alter the trajectory, making it impossible to deduce \\\\( f(x) \\\\) accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
