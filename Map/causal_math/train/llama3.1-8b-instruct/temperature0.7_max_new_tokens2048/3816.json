  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the final state of the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions, like \\( L \\) or \\( M \\), were used, based solely on the Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform outcome could result from varying degrees and combinations of interventions due to the complexity introduced by applying different operators such as \\( L \\) and \\( M \\). The non-trivial interaction between these operators and their parameters can yield similar spectral characteristics, making it impossible to infer the exact interventions uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
