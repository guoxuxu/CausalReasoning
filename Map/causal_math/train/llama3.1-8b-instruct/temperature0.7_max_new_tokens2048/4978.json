  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), with a constant complex number \\\\( s \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the use of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the effect of the integral transformation on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to T obscures the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to integration involving a potentially unknown parameter \\\\( s \\\\), making it infeasible to trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
