  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Here, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is described by the time-domain differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal or control function. The Fourier transform is taken with respect to the function after applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the function is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) be equal to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ Dx \\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\) modifies the input to the differential equation, impacting the frequency contents of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The Fourier transform of the modified state \\\\( Dx \\\\) will therefore differ from the Fourier transform had \\\\( D \\\\) not been applied to the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
