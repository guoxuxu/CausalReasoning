  "Problem": "Consider an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\lambda (t-s)} y(s) ds \\\\), where k and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. This models a system where the rate of change of \\\\( y \\\\) depends on both its current state and a weighted integral of its history.\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at a specific endpoint \\\\( T \\\\) after an intervention, can we precisely establish whether the parameter changed was \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed in \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could potentially result from changes in \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), or both, and these effects might be indistinguishably integrated through the integro-differential dynamics. The system's response making it is impossible to uniquely attribute changes in \\\\( y(T) \\\\) to specific parameter adjustments without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
