  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and considering the potential alterations due to D, the effect observed could be due to multiple potential initial states and transformations, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without additional information on the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
