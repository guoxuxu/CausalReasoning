  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a skew-symmetric matrix. Analyze the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) over time t, where N is another skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be inferred after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to uniquely retrace the path to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The application of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) impacts the trajectory uniquely depending on N, making deducing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by just observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) infeasible unless N and M are specially related, such as commutative.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
