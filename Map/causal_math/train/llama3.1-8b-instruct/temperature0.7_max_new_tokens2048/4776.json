  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) in the complex plane and its transformation under the integral \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} h(z) \\, dz \\) along a contour \\( \\gamma \\). The contour \\( \\gamma \\) is relevant as it defines the effect of \\( h \\) after transformation via path integral.\n\nBased on the integral result \\( I[h'] \\) after applying \\( g(z) \\), can it be conclusively determined whether \\( g(z) \\) was added to \\( h(z) \\) if \\( I[h'] \\) is nonzero?",
  "Explanation": "The nonzero value of \\(I[h']\\) can result merely from the integral of \\(h(z)\\) if \\( \\gamma \\) encloses the pole of \\(h(z)\\). Without additional information about \\( g(z) \\) and its effects within \\( \\gamma \\), we cannot definitively claim that \\( g(z) \\) influenced the outcome besides \\( h(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
