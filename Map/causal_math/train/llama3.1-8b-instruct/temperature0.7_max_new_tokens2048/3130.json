  "Problem": "Consider an integrable complex function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where \\\\(x \\\\) is a real variable. This scenario explores the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and its complex conjugate transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\overline{z(t)}\\\\}(s) \\\\) with respect to a variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nFrom the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we fully retrieve the initial complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the precise original complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is contingent on the absence of non-analytical features and reliance on proper inverse Laplace methodology. Practical and theoretical limitations in the inversion process can hinder the full reconstruction of the original function, particularly if the function contains singularities or discontinuities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
