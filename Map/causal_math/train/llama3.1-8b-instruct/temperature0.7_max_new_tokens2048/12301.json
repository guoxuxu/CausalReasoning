  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t=0 confidently without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes non-trivial as the transformation by \\\\( e^{tC} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial conditions. Moreover, the non-reversible nature of matrix exponentiation with unknown C complicates the recovery of initial states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
