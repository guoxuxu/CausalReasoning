  "Problem": "Consider a function-space where transformations are governed by the Laplace Transform of functions. Let \\\\( p(t) = L[f(t)](s) \\\\) represent the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time variable and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially unknown and is determined to satisfy an integral equation in the form \\\\( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(t) e^{-st} dt = F(s) \\\\), which implies \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as the causal element.\n\nGiven \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t=T, can we precisely backtrack the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without knowing the initial formation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be reconstructed back to a Laplace Transform, absence of the initial form or additional transforms that might have been applied on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) (like filtering or signal processing influences) obscures determination of the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
