  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a complex constant. Let's focus on its behavior under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing an angular frequency, and t represents time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z \\\\) to \\\\( z' = e^{-i\\omega t}z \\\\), will the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely determined by the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without dependency on the initial conditions or the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects the trajectory by applying an inverse rotation, and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the original trajectory and the modification at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The output depends on the initial condition, the function \\\\( g \\\\), and changes introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
