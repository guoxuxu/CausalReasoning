  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a nonzero complex constant.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( j(z) = Dz \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant is applied as an intervention at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( j(z) = Dz \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but is significantly influenced by \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\) through their effects on the system’s dynamics pre- and post-intervention. Both the scalar multiplicative effects and nonlinear term play roles.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
