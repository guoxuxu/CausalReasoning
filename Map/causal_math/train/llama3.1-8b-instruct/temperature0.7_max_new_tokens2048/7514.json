  "Problem": "Examine the effects of altering the matrix in the linear transformation \\\\(T(v) = Av\\\\) on vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix. Consider the new transformation given by \\\\(f(v) = (A+D)v\\\\) after a perturbation matrix \\\\(D\\\\) is added. Assume both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\(v(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we determine whether the transformation applied was \\\\(T(v)\\\\) or \\\\(f(v)\\\\) without prior knowledge of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the perturbation matrix \\\\(D\\\\) was added initially, it is impossible to conclude definitively which transformation was applied. Both transformations could potentially yield the same observed endpoint under certain conditions (for instance, if \\\\(D\\\\) had a transient or negligible effect).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
