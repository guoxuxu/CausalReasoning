  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) that maps complex numbers to other complex numbers defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We analyze the behavior of this function under different transformations and the inversion through the integral transformation \\\\( W(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-uz} w(z) \\\\, dz \\\\).\n\nCan the specific type of intervention (whether \\\\( v(z) \\\\), \\\\( w(z) \\\\), or both) be uniquely identified from the endpoint \\\\( W(u) \\\\) solely based on the outcome value?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions can lead to overlapping results in the transformed output \\\\( W(u) \\\\), especially due to non-linear effects like squaring and the exponential matrix. Without additional information about the process or initial conditions, the specific interventions cannot be deduced solely from the final value of \\\\( W(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
