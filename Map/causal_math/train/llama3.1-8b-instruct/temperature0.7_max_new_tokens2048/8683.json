  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an additional signal shaping function \\\\( h(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied during the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(x)f(x) \\\\), will the resultant spectrum be solely influenced by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces another level of signal shaping, which influences the final spectrum alongside \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) together alter the signal’s spectrum by their combined filtering effects, resulting in a convolution of effects in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
