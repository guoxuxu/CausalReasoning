  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit that involves a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) in series connected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The relationship between the current (I) and the voltage (V) across the circuit can be modeled using a differential equation \\\\( V - L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} - RI = 0 \\\\). We are also interested in the impact of a Laplace Transform on this differential equation.\n\nIf, observing the modified current I(t) at time T after the introduction of the new resistance R', can we conclusively determine whether such an intervention (change in resistance) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of a change in current characteristics alone cannot reliably indicate whether it was solely due to an intervention like a resistance change, or coupled with other factors such as changes in other parameters or initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
