  "Problem": "Assume the eigenvalues of a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) are being tracked over time within the context of the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_A(t) = \\\\text{det}(A - tI) \\\\). We consider the intervention of a matrix function \\\\( f(t, A) = A + tB \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix that commutes with \\\\( A \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(t, A) = e^{Ct}A \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_{A}(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t, A) \\\\) introduces a modifying exponential factor, thereby affecting the eigenvalues of \\\\( A \\\\). Consequently, the final characteristic polynomial \\\\( p_{A}(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the exponential transformations related to both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), altering the determinant computation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
