  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both), just by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) could result from different combinations of transformations due to the linear nature and superposition property in the differential equation. The frequency components influenced by \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\) might overlap or interfere in ways that obscure the specific transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
