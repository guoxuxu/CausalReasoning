  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The effect of a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), on this system is analyzed.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z) \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain point s, can we accurately infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowledge of the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Each of the matrices A and B affects the individual components x and y, therefore altering their contributions to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without knowledge of A and B, multiple combinations of initial states could yield similar transforms, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( L(z) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
