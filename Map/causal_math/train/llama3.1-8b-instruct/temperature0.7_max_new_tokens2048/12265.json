  "Problem": "Assume a system defined by the integral equation \\\\( y = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) a time-varying vector function. We further explore the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to analyze this system, shifting a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\) to observe causal relationships.\n\nCan one uniquely recover the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) without knowing whether a Laplace transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) can theoretically recover a function correlated to \\\\( y \\\\), without confirmation whether the Laplace transform or another operation (like filtering or modification in another domain) was applied, multiple potential inverse functions might satisfy the given conditions, especially due to different possible poles and zeros of \\\\( A \\\\) and the complex plane behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
