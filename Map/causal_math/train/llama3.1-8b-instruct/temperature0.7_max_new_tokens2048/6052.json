  "Problem": "Imagine a physical system that can be modeled by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a region. Consider interventions performed using a boundary condition modification where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) on part of the boundary is altered using a function \\\\(h(t, x)\\\\), which is timedependent.\n\nCan we ascertain which specific modifications (interventions on boundary conditions) were implemented by observing the final state \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) at some \\\\(t > t_1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) could potentially result from numerous similar yet distinct intervention profiles because of the linear nature and boundary condition sensitivity of the Laplace equation. Multiple boundary condition scenarios could lead to the same or indistinguishably close results in the solution domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
