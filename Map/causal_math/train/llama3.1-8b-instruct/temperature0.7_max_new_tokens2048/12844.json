  "Problem": "Assume we have a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a fixed matrix. Consider analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the system's response function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), hoping to infer causal relations.\n\nIf an input signal \\\\( x_0 \\\\), defined at t = 0, evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without intervention, and the Laplace Transform is applied at time t = T, is the Laplace domain representation the same as if \\\\( L(x(t)) \\\\) was taken immediately after applying the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L(x(t)) \\\\) of the system's response under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) only depends on the system's dynamics and initial state, hence will be consistent at any time T following the initial condition, given that no intervention has modulated the dynamics of the systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Input signal x_0 → Laplace Transform L; Laplace Transform L → Matrix D; Matrix D → System response x(t); System response x(t) → Laplace domain representation; Initial condition application → System response x(t); Time t = T → Laplace Transform L application timing; Input signal x_0 → System response x(t); Laplace Transform L application timing → System response x(t)"
