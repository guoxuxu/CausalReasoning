  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) applied on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Further, investigate the causal relationship when we apply an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\{ G(\\\\omega) \\\\} = g(t) \\\\) on a frequency domain representation \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nHaving observed \\\\( f(t) \\\\) after applying and then inversely applying the Laplace transform, can we confirm with certainty that \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was the original Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The bijective nature of the Laplace transformation, when considering functions within its operational confines, ensures that the observed \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was indeed derived from its original Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), assuming all inverses and transforms are properly computed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
