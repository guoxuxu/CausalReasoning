  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) that is subjected to the operator \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Analyze scenarios where an additional transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) post-intervention, can we uniquely identify that the original function was multiplied by \\\\( t^2 \\\\), rather than any other polynomial or operation?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) gives us some information about the intervention, but it cannot conclusively determine that \\\\( t^2 \\\\) was the exact operation used without additional information. Other polynomial modifications can lead to similar effects in the Laplace transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
