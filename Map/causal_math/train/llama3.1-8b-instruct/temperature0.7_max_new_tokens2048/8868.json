  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a complex-valued function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) is applied to a complex variable z in the domain of holomorphic functions, where A is a constant complex matrix. The system is further evolved by the transformation \\\\(g(z, t) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) with B also a constant complex matrix over time t.\n\nKnowing the outcome at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely backtrack and determine the sequence and type of transformations (possibly involving \\\\(f\\\\), \\\\(g\\\\), and/or \\\\(h\\\\)) applied to reach this state?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) might be reachable through various sequences of applying \\\\(f\\\\), \\\\(g\\\\), and \\\\(h\\\\), especially considering the non-commutativity and potential overlap of matrix exponential effects in complex planes. Different sequences could yield similar endpoints, obscuring the exact path and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
