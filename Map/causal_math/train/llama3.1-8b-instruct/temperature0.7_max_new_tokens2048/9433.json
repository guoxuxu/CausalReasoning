  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if no Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the representation from time domain to frequency domain and does not affect the state dynamics directly. However, the initial application of the Fourier transform doesn't modify the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself in the time domain; the resulting Fourier transform at time \\\\( T \\\\) reflects the state evolved from the original, untransformed \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
