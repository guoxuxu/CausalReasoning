  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect on complex numbers in the context of the complex plane transformation. We investigate how this transformation influences the properties of integration along a closed contour C, before and after specific interventions.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the original configuration of the contour \\\\( C_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) was applied, it isn't possible to uniquely determine the original configuration of \\\\( C_0 \\\\). The transformation could significantly change the properties of the contour that are critical to calculating the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
