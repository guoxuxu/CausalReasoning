  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( t \\) represents time. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\( F(z) \\) which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency components \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\( z_0(t) \\) exactly after observing \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) without knowing if any modification, such as a time shift, was applied before the Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is sensitive to initial conditions and transformations applied to \\( z_0(t) \\) like time shifts. Without knowing these modifications precisely, reconstructing \\( z_0(t) \\) exactly from \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) is not guaranteed due to potential alterations in phase or other characteristics embedded in the frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
