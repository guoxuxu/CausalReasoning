  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + ke^{Mt} \\\\), where k is a constant vector and M is a constant matrix, on the solution u(t) over time.\n\nAfter observing the system at time t = T, can we determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied, it's difficult to trace back to the exact initial condition due to the potential modification by \\\\( ke^{Mt} \\\\). The presence of the matrix exponential term complicates the inference of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
