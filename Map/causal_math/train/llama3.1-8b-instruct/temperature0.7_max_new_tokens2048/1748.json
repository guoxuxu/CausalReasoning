  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled as a linear system governed by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix representing the circuit parameters, x is the voltage across various components, and b is the input current source vector. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_a^b x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied to observe accumulated voltage responses over time.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( T(x) \\\\) from time a to b, can we deduce precisely which interventions (either the original configuration of A or the linear transformation \\\\( U(x) \\\\)) were used, based only on knowledge of \\\\( T(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( T(x) \\\\) over [a, b], it is challenging to discern whether changes in the integral outcome were due to the original configuration of the system or the applied intervention \\\\( Cx \\\\). The transformation aggregates effects over an interval, which masks the individual impacts of A and C, making it impossible to uniquely identify the contributions from each intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
