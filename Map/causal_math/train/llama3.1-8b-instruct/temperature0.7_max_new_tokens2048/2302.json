  "Problem": "Let's consider the vector space transformation by the integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), known as the Laplace Transform. We study the behavior when the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, transforms under this operation.\n\nFrom the transformed function \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) without knowing the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, given the transformed function in the s-domain, multiple matrices \\\\( A \\\\), depending on their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, could result in the same output under the Laplace Transform. Without specific knowledge of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "matrix A → transformed function T[f](s); f(t) → T[f](s); s → transformed function T[f](s); s → matrix A; function f(t) → matrix A"
