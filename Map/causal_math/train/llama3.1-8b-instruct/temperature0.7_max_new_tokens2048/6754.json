  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is examined over time.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to accurately reconstruct the original trajectory \\\\( z(t) \\\\) within the interval [0, T] without prior knowledge of the transformation's application?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is a form of averaging and smoothing over the interval, losing specific details and phases of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and making it impossible to precisely recover the original function over the interval only from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
