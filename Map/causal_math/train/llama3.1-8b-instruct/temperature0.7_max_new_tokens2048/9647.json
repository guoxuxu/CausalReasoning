  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) where a new function \\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\) (with D being a different constant matrix) is used, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) only depend on M and not on \\( \\omega \\) or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\( g(x) \\) adds another level of complexity to the system's dynamics. The final state \\( x(T) \\) depends on the interplay between M, \\( \\omega \\), and D. The matrix exponential transformations introduce factors that significantly influence the trajectory and the resultant state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
