  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is applied and then \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex number acting as a constant multiplier.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely specify the interventions used due to the overlapping effects of the exponential functions in the complex plane. Different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\), and their timings can yield the same final state, especially considering the complex exponential growth and its sensitive dependency on initial conditions and parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
