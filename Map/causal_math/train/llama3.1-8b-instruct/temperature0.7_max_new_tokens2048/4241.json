  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant scalar and \\\\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. We study the effect of the Laplace transform on this function over time interval \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) is calculated, does the existence of poles in the transform affect the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of the Laplace transform does not alter the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The presence of poles in the transform is merely a representation of the function's behavior in the frequency domain and does not affect the time-domain form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
