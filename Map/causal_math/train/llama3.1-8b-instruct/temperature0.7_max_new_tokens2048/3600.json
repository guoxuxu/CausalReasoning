  "Problem": "Examine a convolution integral system where the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} x(\\\\tau) h(t-\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the impulse response, a known function. Changes are made to the input signal via transformation \\\\( f(x) = x(t) + e^{at} \\\\), with a being a constant.\n\nCan we accurately establish which transformations (\\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) were applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at different points, solely by analyzing the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations involving \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) can lead to the same output at time T, especially considering the variable behavior of the impulse response function. This plurality in possible inputs and their effects makes it impossible to certainly identify which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
