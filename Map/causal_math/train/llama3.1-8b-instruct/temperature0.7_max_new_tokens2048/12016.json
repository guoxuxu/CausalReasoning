  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf \\\\( T[f] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( w(z) \\\\) without any additional manipulation, will the transformed function at \\\\( z = z_1 \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was not integrated but directly computed at \\\\( z_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform changes the nature of the function from an exponential form to one involving the integral of an exponential, which is fundamentally different from the original function. Direct computation of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) yields \\\\( e^{Az_1} \\\\), whereas the integral will result in a function depending on the integral of \\\\( e^{As} \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( z_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
