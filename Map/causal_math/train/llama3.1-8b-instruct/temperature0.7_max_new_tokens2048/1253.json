  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial function Z(t) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to \\\\( Z(0) = z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under its integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( Z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved under its transformation to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{i\\omega 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\). While the final form appears unchanged initially, the evolution under the integral transformation with a moving frequency introduces shifts in the phase and magnitude, leading to differences at any later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
