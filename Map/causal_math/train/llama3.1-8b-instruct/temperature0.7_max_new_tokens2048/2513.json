  "Problem": "Given a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix, consider examining the impact of the linear transformation \\( T(x) = Qx \\) for a matrix \\( Q \\). We investigate how this affects the system across different time points.\n\nIf \\( T(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( T(x) \\) alters the initial condition to \\( Qx_0 \\). The solution to the differential equation starting from \\( Qx_0 \\) at t = 0 would evolve differently compared to starting from \\( x_0 \\), unless \\( Q \\) commutes with \\( e^{Mt} \\), which is generally not the case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
