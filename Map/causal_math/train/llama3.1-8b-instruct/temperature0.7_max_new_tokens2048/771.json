  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{izt} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represents a function of time. This scenario deals with the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and explores what happens as this transformation is applied to different functional forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\)) is introduced to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\), will the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) for \\\\( z > t_0 \\\\) show a shifted spectral representation compared to the original \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without this factor?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an exponential decay alters the waveform, effectively scaling the amplitude and shifting the spectral content due to the damping factor. This change affects the Fourier transform, leading to modified frequency components and potential broadening of spectral lines.",
