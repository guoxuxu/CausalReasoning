  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nKnowing the eigenvalues of the transformed matrix \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), can the eigenvalues of the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) be exactly determined?",
  "Explanation": "Since the eigenvalues are preserved under similarity transformations, knowing the eigenvalues of \\\\( T(A) \\\\) provides the exact eigenvalues of the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
