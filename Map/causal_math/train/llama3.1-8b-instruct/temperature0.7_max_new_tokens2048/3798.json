  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2 \\\\) and its Laplace Transform, which transforms the function into the s-domain as \\\\( F(s) \\\\). We explore whether the transformed system under differently parameterized transformations still retains causal relationships.\n\nCan the original value \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be uniquely recovered by applying the inverse Laplace transform to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after some evolution in s-domain without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), assuming no singularities or other transformations have occurred in the s-domain beyond what the initial transformation dictated, will recover \\\\( x_0 \\\\) exactly because the transform and its inverse are unique under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
