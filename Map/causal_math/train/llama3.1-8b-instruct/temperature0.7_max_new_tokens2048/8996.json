  "Problem": "A system is governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + Az\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We explore the role of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a different constant matrix influencing the trajectory over time t.\n\nGiven the final condition \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from multiple different combinations of transformations through \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), owing to the compounded effects of the matrix exponentials and nonlinear dynamics. This variability leads to ambiguous scenarios where several plausible sequences of transformations could lead to the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
