  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which is a mapping from the complex plane to itself, given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The time evolution of a system is initially influenced by the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\), then governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\), where c is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and seeing only the outcome at time T, it's impossible to determine if the initial state was modified by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega z_0} \\\\). The transformation could drastically alter the phase and hence the entire trajectory, making retrodiction to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
