  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the differential equations set \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + b\\\\) where A is a linear operator and b is a constant vector. An integral transformation is defined by \\\\( f(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) for a time period T.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention redefines the system to \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Dx(t) + c\\\\) when both D and c are constant, will the endpoint \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at T rely only on the initial setup (A, b) and not on the intervention (D, c)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the dynamics through both D and c, which will affect how the state evolves post-intervention. The transformed function output \\\\( f(x) \\\\) will therefore reflect the cumulative effects of both the original system defined by A, b and the new system defined by D, c, impacting the result at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
