  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of replacing a matrix A in a linear system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) with a new matrix \\\\(A' = A + B\\\\), where B introduces a perturbation. Let the initial condition be \\\\(x_0\\\\) and consider the effect of operator \\\\(f(x) = e^{Bt}x\\\\) over time.\n\nCan we discern the specific nature of the interventions (whether adjustment was made to A or B was introduced as a perturbation) solely based on observation of \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at endpoint T?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), the specific alterations to the system — be it through A or through an introduced B — cannot be distinctly identified because of the intertwined effects that can manifest similar dynamical outcomes. The result is therefore ambiguous regarding the nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
