  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) in two dimensions, where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential. The complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) is applied to the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\), with \\\\( w \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain point in time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different function \\\\( g(z) = e^{uz} \\\\) (where \\\\( u \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention at a specific boundary, will the potential \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) within the domain ultimately depend on the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) as well as \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) influence the boundary conditions separately, and the resultant potential function \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) depends on how each transformation alters these conditions. The distinct effects of each transformation propagate through the domain influenced by the Laplace equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
