  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions that describe oscillations in a physical system modeled by the second order differential equation \\( \\\\ddot{z} + \\omega^2 z = 0 \\). The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the initial conditions for the system are modified by adding a constant \\( c \\) to \\( u(0) \\) and the system evolves according to the given differential equation, will the resulting function \\( \\tilde{z}(t) = \\tilde{u}(t) + i\\tilde{v}(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) be equivalent to \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) extended by the constant \\( c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in initial conditions affects the entire trajectory of the solution. Specifically, the behavior of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) will differ from their original forms, and this discrepancy will not be a mere translation of the trajectory by \\( c \\) due to the oscillatory nature of the solutions governed by the characteristics of the second order differential system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
