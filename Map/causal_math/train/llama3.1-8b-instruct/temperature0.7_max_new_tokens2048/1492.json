  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine conclusively which interventions were utilized (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), simply by observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be reached by different sequences of transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or just one of them, due to the periodic and overlapping effects of powers on the complex exponential function. The endpoint therefore does not uniquely specify the pathway of transformations applied because of these potential combinations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
