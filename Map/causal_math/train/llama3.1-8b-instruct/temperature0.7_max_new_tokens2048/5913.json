  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nIf the rotation function \\\\(f(t, v)\\\\) is applied to vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t=0\\\\) and allowed to evolve naturally until time \\\\(t=T\\\\), will the final position of the vector be the same as if it were directly subjected to rotation for the same period without initial application of \\\\(f\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of applying \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\) directly from the beginning and allowing it to evolve naturally is consistent with applying it at any initial time as the function describes a pure rotation with a constant angular velocity, leading to the same end position at time \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
