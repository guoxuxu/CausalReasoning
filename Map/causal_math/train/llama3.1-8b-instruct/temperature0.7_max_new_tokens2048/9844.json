  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the equation \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)](s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) = z(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent complex function.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( L[g(t)](s) \\\\) at \\\\( s \\\\) post-intervention, can we specifically identify whether the intervention involved changes to \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), or ascertain if both or neither were changed?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( L[g(t)](s) \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) post-intervention encodes information about the sum of the effects due to changes in both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\). Without prior knowledge about the baseline form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or additional constraints, we cannot uniquely determine the nature of the modifications made to \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) solely from the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
