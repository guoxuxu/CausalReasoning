  "Problem": "Analyze the response of a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) to the system state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and study the progression over time t.\n\nKnowing the resultant state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) after interventions, can we ascertain definitively what transformations (Fourier, Laplace, or both) were applied and at what times, only from knowledge of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the differing influence of Fourier and Laplace transforms (affecting frequency and exponential decay respectively), and since their effects can compound or mask each other depending on the system dynamics and operator L, it's impossible to determine precisely which transforms were applied and when, solely based on the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\). This ambiguity is compounded by the non-reversibility and overlapping impacts of such transformations on the state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
