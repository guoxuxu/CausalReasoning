  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we conclusively determine which transformations (either \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both) were applied, just by knowing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could result from various combinations of the transformations \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\), as well as natural evolution under \\( C \\). The effects of \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) may overlap or interplay in a way that makes it impossible to decipher precisely which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
