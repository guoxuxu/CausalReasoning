  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We also define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, applied to the function z over the time period t.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the temporal evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible due to potential non-unique pathways leading to the same endpoint, influenced by non-commutative matrix effects. Multiple transformation sequences could produce the same final state, obscuring the causative transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
