  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We are examining the properties of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f](s) \\\\) of this function, given for a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the value of \\\\( s \\\\) in the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[f](s) \\\\) is changed from \\\\( s_0 \\\\) to \\\\( s_1 \\\\), will the resultant transformation exclusively reflect the impact of this change in \\\\( s \\\\) without any external modifications affecting \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operator that uniquely transforms \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) based on the parameter \\\\( s \\\\). Altering \\\\( s \\\\) will change the outcome of the transformation according to its definition, and as there are no external modifications to \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation exclusively reflects the change in \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
