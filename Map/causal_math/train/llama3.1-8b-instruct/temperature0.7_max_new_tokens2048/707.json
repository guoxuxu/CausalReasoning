  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\), which converts it from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nIf an additional phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, resulting in the transformation of \\\\( e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\), does the frequency domain still represent a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the phase shift modifies the phase of the signal, the primary frequency component remains at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Thus, the Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\) is a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), shifted by the phase factor \\\\( e^{i \\phi} \\\\) that does not affect the frequency location.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
