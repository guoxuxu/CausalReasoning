  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\), within a certain region. Consider a transformation by the function \\\\(f(u) = e^{ikx} u\\\\) where k is a constant and x represents a spatial variable.\n\nIf at a certain point x1, a function \\\\(g(u) = e^{-ikx} u\\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the final function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) for x > x1 depend solely on the original propagation without considering k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(u)\\\\) counteracts the effect of the earlier \\\\(f(u)\\\\) transformation, likely restoring some original characteristics of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\). However, the combination and possible complex interaction between \\\\(e^{ikx}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{-ikx}\\\\) can modify the function in a manner dependent on k, affecting the result at any point x > x1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
