  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance \\\\(Z(s) = sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are the inductance and capacitance, respectively. The circuit's response to a voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is modeled by the transfer function \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sL + \\\\frac{1}{sC}}\\\\). We examine the application of the Laplace Transform and its inverse to analyze the time domain and frequency domain behaviors.\n\nIf a step input voltage \\\\(V(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s}\\\\) is applied to the circuit without any modifications, will the resulting current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) in the time domain be identical to the response predicted by directly using the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\(H(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the input voltage \\\\(V(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s}\\\\) and using the transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\) to get \\\\(I(s) = H(s)V(s)\\\\) followed by the inverse Laplace Transform will lead to the same current response \\\\(I(t)\\\\) as directly using the inverse Laplace on \\\\(H(s)\\\\). This shows that the analysis is consistent in both frequency and time domains without any modifications to the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
