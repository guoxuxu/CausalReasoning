  "Problem": "Analyze a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) is considered as an intervention on the system, with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf we observe the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z = T \\\\) without any intervention, does the resulting function value depend exclusively on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no intervention was introduced, the evolution of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T depends solely on the exponentiation driven by \\\\( A \\\\), hence the state at \\\\( z = T \\\\) is ruled only by transformations induced by \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
