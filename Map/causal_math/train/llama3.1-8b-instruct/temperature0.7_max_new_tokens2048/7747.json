  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional linear dynamical system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with M being a 2x2 constant matrix. The system is subjected to the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another 2x2 constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a different constant 2x2 matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) further complicates the system by introducing another transformation, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on M, but also on D and F. The transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) can interact in complex ways, affecting the trajectory and resulting state significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
