  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is applied to transform a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) via the integral \\( G(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{az} g(z) \\, dz \\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number, and the transformation explores how changes in \\\\( a \\\\) affect the outcome of the integral transformation.\n\nCan we determine what specific transformation or intervention (change in \\\\( a \\\\) or modification from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) occurred, based solely on observing the resultant transformation \\\\( G(a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions solely based on the outcome \\\\( G(a) \\\\) is infeasible due to the complex interaction between \\\\( a \\\\) and the function in the integral. Multiple combinations of changes in \\\\( a \\\\) and transformations from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could yield similar results in \\\\( G(a) \\\\), leading to ambiguity in pinpointing the exact nature of changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
