  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform, which we denote as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) = F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\) without further modifications to the function, will the transformation output, \\\\( F(s) \\\\), represent a simple translation in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\) results in a function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), which is not just a translation but a transformation involving a rotation and dilation, as determined by the complex pole at \\\\( s=iw \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
