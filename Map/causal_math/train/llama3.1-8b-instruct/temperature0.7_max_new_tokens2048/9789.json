  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex number constant. The analysis focuses on the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex number constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and subsequently the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without additional intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) modifies the initial state of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) affects the trajectory of the complex function depending on the relationship between Q and P, it leads to a different final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
