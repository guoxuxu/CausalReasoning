  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we examine the flow of an incompressible fluid using the Navier-Stokes equations in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The equations are given by \\\\(\\\\rho (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\mathbf{u}) = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\mu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the fluid density, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of manipulating the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as an external intervention.\n\nIf the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is increased at the time of initialization, will the resulting velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(t)\\\\) at any time t > 0 have a slower rate of change compared to the original viscosity setting?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) leads to greater diffusivity, which according to the Navier-Stokes equations results in a slower rate of change in the velocity field. The increased viscosity dampens the fluid motion, making it more resistant to flow changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
