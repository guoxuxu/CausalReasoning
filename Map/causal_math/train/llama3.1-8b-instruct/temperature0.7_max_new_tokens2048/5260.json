  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation by the function \\\\( g(u) = U(t)u \\\\), with \\\\( U(t) \\\\) being a unitary operator, is conducted.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(u) = U(t)u \\\\), another transformation, or both) solely from the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of unitary transformations due to their nature of preserving certain structures but altering initial conditions. Multiple sequences of interventions can lead to indistinguishably similar endpoints, making it difficult to pinpoint specific transformations only based on the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
