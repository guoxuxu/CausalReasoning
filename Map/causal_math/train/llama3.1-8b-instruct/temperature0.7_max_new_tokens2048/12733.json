  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a wave propagating in space and time. We analyze this system after performing a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) in the frequency domain at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) without knowing it was subjected to the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution derived from the differential equation in the frequency domain provides a one-to-one mapping from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) back to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\). The properties of the Fourier transformation and the linear character of the PDE allow reverse calculation directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
