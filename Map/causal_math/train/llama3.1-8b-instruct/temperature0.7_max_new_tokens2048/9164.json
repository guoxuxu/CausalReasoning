  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the transformed function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s)\\\\), can we determine the original parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\(c\\\\) only by knowing the pole of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)}\\\\) reveals \\\\(a+c\\\\) as its real part and \\\\(b\\\\) as its imaginary part. If \\\\(c\\\\) is known, \\\\(a\\\\) can be determined by subtracting \\\\(c\\\\) from the real part of the pole, uniquely identifying all parameters.",
