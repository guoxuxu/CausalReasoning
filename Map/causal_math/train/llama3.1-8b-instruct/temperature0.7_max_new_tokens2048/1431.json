  "Problem": "Consider a linear system modeled by the equation \\\\( u' = Du \\\\), where D is a linear operator acting on a vector space V. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation, defined by the operator \\\\( T(u) = Evu \\\\), where E is a matrix and v is a scalar, and then examining the system's response over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( M(u) = Ku_1 \\\\) (where K is another matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on E or K?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another variable into the system's evolution. Therefore, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is dependent on E (from the initial transformation), K (from the intervention), and D (the system operator). Each contributes in shaping the trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
