  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's output. Suppose an external operator transforms the function using a unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( g(t) = f(t) u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\) where \\\\( g(t) = f(t) u(t-a) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shift introduced by the unit step function affects the Laplace transform in a way that depends directly on \\\\( a \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the shift correctly and recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) accurately from \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
