  "Problem": "The behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. An operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling factor.\n\nAfter observing the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the operation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of information about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at the initial time leaves ambiguity in determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various initial conditions depending on whether or not the scaling operation was applied, especially considering complex exponential growth or decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
