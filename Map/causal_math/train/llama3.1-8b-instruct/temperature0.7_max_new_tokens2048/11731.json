  "Problem": "Consider the relationship between the input vector \\\\(x\\\\) and the output vector \\\\(y\\\\) in a linear system characterized by the matrix equation \\\\(y = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a transformation matrix in linear algebra. We explore the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) which alters \\\\(x\\\\) to \\\\(x' = T(x)\\\\) and examine its effects.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(y''\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence and types of transformations (both \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\)) applied to \\\\(x\\\\) merely based on the knowledge of \\\\(y''\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same final state \\\\(y''\\\\) at \\\\(T\\\\) could result from various sequences and combinations of transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\), reflecting non-uniqueness due to the linear transformations and the potential overlapping effects. Different transformations can align to give an equivalent resultant vector, making it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
