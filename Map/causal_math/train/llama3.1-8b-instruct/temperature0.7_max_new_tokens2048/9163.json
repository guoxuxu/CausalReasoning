  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nIf an additional transformation defined by multiplying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) (where \\\\(c\\\\) is a real constant) is applied before taking the Laplace transform, will the pole of the resulting function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s)\\\\) be solely influenced by \\\\(c\\\\) and not by \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original function to \\\\(e^{ct}z(t) = e^{(a+c+bi)t}\\\\), and its Laplace transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{ct}z(t))(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)}\\\\), has a pole at \\\\(s = a+c+bi\\\\), clearly influenced by \\\\(a\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(c\\\\). Thus, the pole's location depends on all three parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
