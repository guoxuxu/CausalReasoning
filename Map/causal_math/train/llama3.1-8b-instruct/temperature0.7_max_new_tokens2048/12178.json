  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the response of a complex system under the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) while iterating through scenarios of system modification or the imposition of a boundary condition.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a new parameter \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) is introduced affecting the system (\\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega' t}z(t) \\\\)), will the Laplace transform at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) reflect only the changes due to the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) modifies the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through a new oscillatory contribution, making the resulting transform at any future point a composition influenced by both frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "parameter change → new parameter ω'; new parameter ω' → z'(t); z'(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → reflection of changes due to original ω; Laplace transform → reflection of changes due to ω'; time t1 → parameter change; time t1 → new parameter ω'; time T → Laplace transform; T > t1 → time t1"
