  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. Evaluate the system's response to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(s-t)M}z(s) ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nBased on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) on the starting points and the subsequent system evolution blur the trace to the original function, particularly as the matrix M and time integration introduce non-invertibility and loss of information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
