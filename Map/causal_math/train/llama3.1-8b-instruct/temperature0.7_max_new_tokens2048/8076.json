  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents an oscillating system in the complex plane. We then apply a Laplace transform to this function, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), can we determine if any damping or other modifications were applied to the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) solely based on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\) strongly suggests that no damping (or other modifications that would affect the transformation) was applied, assuming the transform was accurately calculated. However, without additional information, subtle modifications cannot be definitively ruled out, especially if they compensate each other out (such as simultaneous damping and amplification).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace transform → Z(s) = 1 / (s - iw); Z(s) = 1 / (s - iw) → s → iw; Z(s) = 1 / (s - iw) → Z(s) → 1 / (s - iw)"
