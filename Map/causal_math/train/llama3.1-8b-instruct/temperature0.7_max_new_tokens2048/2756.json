  "Problem": "Consider a feedback loop circuit implementing a Laplace Transform. Let \\\\( u(t) \\\\) be the input and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the output, subject to the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). The impact of an external signal modification by a complex function \\\\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\\\), where s is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nCan we precisely identify all interventions (both \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\)) applied to the system, merely by observing the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the similar effects that exponential functions have in the Laplace transform and the summing or scaling nature of linear systems, multiple combinations of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\) might yield similar responses at \\\\( y(T) \\\\). Thus, without additional information, identifying the precise interventions from the output alone is ambiguous due to the potential overlap in modifications to the input signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
