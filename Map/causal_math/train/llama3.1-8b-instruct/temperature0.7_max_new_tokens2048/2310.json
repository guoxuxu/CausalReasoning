  "Problem": "Assume a complex signal processing system that employs a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), to convert time domain signals, \\\\( s(t) \\\\), into frequency domain representations. We analyze the causal effects of applying an inverse Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(F) \\\\), and modifications to the signal post transform.\n\nGiven the output after inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}(F(s)) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) without additional information on the Fourier transformation parameters?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( s(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( L^{-1}(F(s)) \\\\) is flawed without knowledge of the specific parameters and the handling in the Fourier transform, such as cut-off frequencies and phase shifts. Details lost during transformation affect the possible reconstruction accuracy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
