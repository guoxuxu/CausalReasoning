  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) representing a wave at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\). Analyze the influence of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf we apply the decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then perform the Laplace Transform without any other manipulation, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) become \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When applying the decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) directly to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it modifies the input of the Laplace Transform. The resulting transformed function now includes the decay rate \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) in its s-domain representation, correctly adjusting the original pole from \\\\( s = i \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( s = \\alpha + i \\omega \\\\), thus yielding \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Multiplying z(t) by e^(-αt) → z'(t) with z'(t) = e^(-αt) * e^(iωt); Applying the Laplace Transform → Z'(s) = 1 / (s + α - iω)"
