  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) and a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) applied to vector \\\\( v \\\\) in Euclidean space. Matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is constant, and the Fourier transform operates on function space representations of \\\\( v \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention applying a filter \\\\( h(v) \\\\) in the Fourier domain is introduced after the linear transformation and prior to the Fourier transform, will the resulting vector's transformation be only dependent on matrix \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a filtering process in the Fourier domain fundamentally alters the resultant vector post-Fourier transform. The output now depends on the specific characteristics of \\\\( h(v) \\\\), along with the effects of \\\\( M \\\\). This dependency introduces additional dynamics beyond just the influence of \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → T(v); T(v) → \\mathcal{F}(v); h(v) → \\mathcal{F}(v); \\mathcal{F}(v) → T(v) after intervention"
