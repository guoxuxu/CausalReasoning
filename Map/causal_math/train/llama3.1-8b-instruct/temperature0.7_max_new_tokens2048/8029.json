  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The focus is on understanding the behavior of the inverse Laplace transform evaluated over different time intervals t and interpreting the effect of parameter s.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) is increased, holding all else constant, will the magnitude of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) generally decrease without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( s \\\\) increases the exponential decay rate in the integral, which results in a generally lower overall integration value, thereby reducing the magnitude of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This reflects how changing s influences the decay behavior directly linked to the integral's convergence characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
