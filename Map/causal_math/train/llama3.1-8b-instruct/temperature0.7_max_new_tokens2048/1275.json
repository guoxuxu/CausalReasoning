  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( u(t, x) = e^{tA}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( g(t, x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sB}x \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix, applied at time zero.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) is introduced at time zero in addition to \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), will the output at \\\\( T \\\\) depend solely on the initial vector and matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) at the initial time imposes an additional transformation through matrix \\\\( B \\\\), resulting in an integral impact alongside the exponential effect of matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) is thus influenced by both matrices, \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), affecting the evolution of the system in a combined manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
