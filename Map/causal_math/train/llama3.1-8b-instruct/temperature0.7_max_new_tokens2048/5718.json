  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We introduce a transformation using the integral operator \\\\( I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately back-trace to the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( I \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge of the application of \\\\( I \\\\), the effect of the initial transformation involving the integration and exponential based on matrix C is unknown. This makes it impossible to conclusively revert or decode back to the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\), as the integration might have crucially altered the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
