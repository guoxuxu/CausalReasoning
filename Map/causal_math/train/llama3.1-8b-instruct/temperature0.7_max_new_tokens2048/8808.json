  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\), where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of implementing a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) on x(t) and then applying an inverse Fourier transform to observe the effects on the evolution of x(t) over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\( x(T) \\), can we specify precisely what interventions were implemented (whether just the Fourier operations or the application of \\( g(x) \\), or both) based solely on \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output state \\( x(T) \\) could result from various sequences of the Fourier operations and the matrix operation \\( g(x) \\). Since the Fourier operations could have been reversed without affecting the final observed state when combined with the linear dynamics of A and B, multiple potential scenarios could lead to the same \\( x(T) \\), making exact determination of interventions impossible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
