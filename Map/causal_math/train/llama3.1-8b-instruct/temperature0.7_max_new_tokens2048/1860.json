  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We apply a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) over time t, where C is a diagonal matrix representing an integral transform.\n\nFrom the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine with certainty the interventions applied, specifically whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both, were used during the period from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping influences of the transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) on the trajectory of z, multiple combinations of interventions could lead to the same endpoint, particularly when the effects of C and D on A and B produce similar or indistinguishable modifications in trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → Ax; A → x; B → By; B → y; C → e^(Ct); e^(Ct) → z; f(z) → z; g(z) is not mentioned as a causal variable; \n  the application of f(z) is a direct causal link; the transformation f(z) is a direct result of e^(Ct)z; z(T) → x(T); z(T) → y(T)"
