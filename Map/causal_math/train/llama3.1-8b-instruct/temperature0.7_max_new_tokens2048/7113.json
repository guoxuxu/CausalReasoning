  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the influence of a transformation characterized by the function \\\\( t(x) = \\\\int e^{sx} ds \\\\) on spatial variable x, where s represents a parameter.\n\nIf \\\\( t(x) \\\\) is employed on a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and is then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the direct evolution of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( t(x) \\\\) changes the initial state, modifying the response of the system. The integral transform can significantly alter the characteristics of \\\\( u_0 \\\\), leading to a different evolution under the operator L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
