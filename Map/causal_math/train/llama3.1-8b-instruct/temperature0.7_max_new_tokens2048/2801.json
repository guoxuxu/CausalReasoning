  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is the initial condition vector. We explore the impact of the operator \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Ft}z \\\\), where R is a complex matrix function and F a constant matrix, applied over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition vector to \\\\( Re^{F \\\\cdot 0}x = Rx \\\\). The system's trajectory is then altered from the outset, evolving under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}(Rx) \\\\), which depends on the interaction between R and C, and thereby leads to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
