  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario governed by the equation \\\\( z = Cw \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a complex matrix. Additionally, we have an integral transform of z, defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf a new complex matrix \\\\( D \\\\) is applied to \\\\( w(t) \\\\) after a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), then the integral transform is applied, does the final output \\\\( T(Dw(t)) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a different matrix \\\\( D \\\\) introduces a new transformation dynamic to the vector \\\\( w(t) \\\\) prior to the transform \\\\( T \\\\), influencing the final outcome. Therefore, the transformed output \\\\( T(Dw(t)) \\\\) depends on both C and D, along with the nature of their application within the given time frame.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
