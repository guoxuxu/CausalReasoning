  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. Evaluate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where Q is another complex constant.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( S(z) = \\\\frac{d}{dt} (e^{Rt}z) \\\\) (where R is another complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( S(z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the system dynamics by deriving from another exponentiated factor. The output at time T will depend significantly on how the contributions from R and Q interact with P through the combination of differential and integral effects, reshaping the trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
