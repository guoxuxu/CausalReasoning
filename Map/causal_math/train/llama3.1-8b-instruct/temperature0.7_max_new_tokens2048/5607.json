  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf the function is modified to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + k)t} \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant shift, and then a Laplace transform is applied, will the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) still reflect only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without showing any influence of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduced by the constant shift \\\\( k \\\\) alters the frequency of the function to \\\\( \\\\omega + k \\\\). Consequently, the Laplace transform of the modified function becomes \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\\\omega + k)} \\\\), which reflects this new frequency, hence showing the influence of \\\\( k \\\\) and not just \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
