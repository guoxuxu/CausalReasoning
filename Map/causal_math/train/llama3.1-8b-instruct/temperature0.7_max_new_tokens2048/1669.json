  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\), with M being a constant complex matrix. We analyze the change when applying a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{iNt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and subsequently let it evolve by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\) without any further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for some t = T be the same as if we had evolved \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz(t)\\\\) up to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially changes the state to \\\\( e^{iN0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as t increases, the effect of \\\\( e^{iNt} \\\\) modifies the trajectory, leading to differing outcomes depending on the relationship and commutativity of N with M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
