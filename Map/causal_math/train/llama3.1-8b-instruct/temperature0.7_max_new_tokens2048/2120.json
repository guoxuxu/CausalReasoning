  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nBearing in mind the intervention on the kernel, can we uniquely determine what changes occurred to \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) based only on observing the endpoint \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential complexity and variety in kernel functions, multiple modifications (\\\\( H(x,t) \\\\)) might yield similar effects on the resulting \\\\( w(x) \\\\). Without additional information about the nature of the intervention or the pre-intervention kernel, it's impossible to uniquely identify the changes in \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
