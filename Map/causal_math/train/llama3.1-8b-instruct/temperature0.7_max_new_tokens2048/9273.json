  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to z(0) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will z(T) at T = t be identical to if z(0) was evolved to T = t under the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The implementation of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) transforms the initial condition by scaling it, which modifies the trajectory governed by the differential equation. The presence of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) scales the amplitude, changing the solution to \\\\( z(t) = z(0)e^{(i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)t} \\\\) instead of \\\\( z(t) = z(0)e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), which differs unless \\\\( \\\\alpha = 0 \\\\).",
