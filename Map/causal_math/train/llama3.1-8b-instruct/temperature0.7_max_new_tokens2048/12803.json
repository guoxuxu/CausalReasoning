  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz \\\\) can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the integral result?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and the possible non-linear interactions among them, make it difficult to identify exactly which transformations were applied based solely on the result of the integral. This ambiguity arises due to the complex interactions and possibly equivalent paths these transformations can create.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
