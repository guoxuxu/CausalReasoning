  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\), where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of implementing a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) on x(t) and then applying an inverse Fourier transform to observe the effects on the evolution of x(t) over time.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) is applied to \\( x(t) \\) at t = 0, followed by an immediate inverse Fourier transform, and then \\( x(t) \\) is evolved under \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform followed by an immediate inverse Fourier transform restores the function to its original form. The state of \\( x(t) \\) remains unchanged initially, thus the evolution under \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\) will proceed as if no transformation was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
