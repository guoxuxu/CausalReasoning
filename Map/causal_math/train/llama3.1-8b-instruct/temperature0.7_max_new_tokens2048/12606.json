  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z' = Cz \\\\), where C is a linear operator. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}e^{Dt}Sz \\\\), where D is a linear operator and S is an invertible matrix, over time t.\n\nAssume another function \\\\( k(z) = Q^{-1}e^{Et}Qz \\\\) (where E is a linear operator and Q is an invertible matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces a new transformation that, along with the initial \\\\( h(z) \\\\), collectively affects the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The influences of D, E, S, and Q together dictate the ultimate state, not just the original operator C or the later E alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
