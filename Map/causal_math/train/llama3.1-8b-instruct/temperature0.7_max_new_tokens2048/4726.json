  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We are examining how the Laplace transform, which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} \\\\) with complex s, affects our causal understanding of this system.\n\nBy having the value of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a certain complex plane point \\\\( s \\\\), can we recover the exact state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i} \\\\), by inversely applying the Laplace transform, one can recover the entire function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). Hence, from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the original time domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any t can be exactly determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
