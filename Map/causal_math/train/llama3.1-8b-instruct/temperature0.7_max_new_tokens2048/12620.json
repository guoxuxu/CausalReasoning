  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a square matrix. We explore the system's response under the integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where N is another constant matrix and t is a parameter for duration.\n\nApplying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then observing the system over time under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if no transformation were applied and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was simply evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial trajectory of the system. The integral factor \\\\( e^{Ns} \\\\) adds layers to the output which integrates past states influenced by matrix N. As such, the resulting state at time T is a cumulative function of past influences and cannot be the same as simple evolution under M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
