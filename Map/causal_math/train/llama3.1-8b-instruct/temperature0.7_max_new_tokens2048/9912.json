  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), where \\( \\\\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z \\) represents a complex function. Investigating the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\( a \\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we accurately determine what interventions were administered (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) by solely observing the end condition \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying interventions solely based on the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) is not feasible given the possibility of multiple transformations leading to the same final state. The interventions \\( e^{at} \\) and \\( e^{bt} \\) could have been applied in various sequences or intensities, resulting in similar outcomes due to the exponential nature of these transformations and the linear characteristics of the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
