  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) obtained from the Laplace transformation, can we uniquely determine the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The structure of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) explicitly reveals \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the imaginary part of the pole. Thus, the original frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be directly identified from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
