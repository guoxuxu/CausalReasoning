  "Problem": "We consider a quantum system where the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\( V(x) \\\\). We study the effect of a measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) defined as \\\\( M \\\\psi(x, t_1) = e^{-iH\\\\tau}\\\\psi(x, t_1) \\\\) where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian of the system and \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) is a measurement time interval.\n\nGiven a final observed state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional context or data on system conditions at or around \\\\( t_1 \\\\), it is generally impossible to back-calculate accurately whether \\\\( M \\\\) was applied due to the inherent uncertainty and variability in quantum state evolution and superposition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
