  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function and its inverse transform in a control system where the transfer function is given by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Consider the impact of manipulating these transformations through convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nBased on the observed output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine whether the input \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was convolved with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as an intervention, assuming the only known is \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\) might be obtained from various theoretical combinations of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), especially without knowing the specific forms or parameters of \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The potential overlap in effects due to convolution and similar resulting outputs deter a definitive identification of whether the intervention took place.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Manipulating the Laplace transform of a function f(t) through convolution with another function g(t) can affect the observed output y(T), but the relationship between the input f(t) and the output y(T) is mediated by the transfer function H(s)."
