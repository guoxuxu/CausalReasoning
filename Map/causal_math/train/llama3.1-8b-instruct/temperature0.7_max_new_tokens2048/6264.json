  "Problem": "Analyzing an electrical system described by the voltage-current relationship using Laplace Transformations. Let \\\\( V(s) = Z(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) \\\\), \\\\( I(s) \\\\), and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of voltage, current, and impedance, respectively. Consider varying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by adding a capacitor with impedance \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\\\), where C is the capacitance.\n\nGiven the final measured voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) in this transformed system, can we determine precisely the interventions (addition of capacitance C or resistance R), without knowing the initial impedance setup?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used based on the final measurements alone is highly challenging due to the potential for various combinations of components to yield similar voltage outputs under different currents. The presence of multiple interacting components introduces ambiguity in the causal inference from effect to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
