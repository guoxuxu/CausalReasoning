  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function and its subsequent inverse transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) to understand causal relationships.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) from the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the exponent of the original function without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) directly determines the form of its Laplace transform. The transform \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) uniquely identifies \\\\( a \\\\) as the pole of the function in the s-domain, allowing us to infer \\\\( a \\\\) without ambiguity.",
