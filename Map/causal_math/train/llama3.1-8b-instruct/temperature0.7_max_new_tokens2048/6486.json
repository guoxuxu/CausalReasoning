  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature distribution over a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal conductivity. Study the effect of a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution, especially when analyzing the system's response to external heat sources.\n\nAfter observing the Fourier-transformed temperature distribution \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to determine \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the evolution of temperature adheres strictly to the heat equation, and the transformation properties of the Fourier Transform under this differential operator are well-defined, it is entirely feasible to reconstruct \\\\( F(u(x,0)) \\\\) from \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) using the inverse operation and back-calculating based on the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
