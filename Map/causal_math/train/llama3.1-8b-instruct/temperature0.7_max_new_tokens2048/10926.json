  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nBy observing changes in the region of convergence of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we infer the specific change in value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the region of convergence indicates a modification in frequency, but the exact value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined without knowing the original value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or having additional constraints — multiple \\\\( \\omega \\\\) values might yield the same or similar shifts in convergence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
