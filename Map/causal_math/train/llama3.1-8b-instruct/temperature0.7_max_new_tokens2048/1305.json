  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) over time \\( t \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the changes in the output when a transformation defined by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) and then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the new function \\( y(t) = g(z(t)) \\) have integral properties that reflect the initial functional form \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) at every \\( t \\) except t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( g(z(t)) \\) directly accumulates the values of \\( z(t) \\), and while \\( y(t) \\) will change over time due to the accumulation, it retains a dependency on the original function \\( z(t) \\). Hence, \\( y(t) \\) directly reflects its derivative as \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), except at \\( t = 0 \\) where it is zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
