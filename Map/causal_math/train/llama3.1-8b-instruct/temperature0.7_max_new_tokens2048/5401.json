  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, the heat diffusion over a plane is studied. The temperature distribution is represented by the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), which satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. The experiment manipulates this distribution via a sudden localized heating at point \\\\( x_0 \\\\), represented by the function \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( \\\\delta(x - x_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) modify the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for times \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) in comparison to a scenario where no localized heating occurs?",
  "Explanation": "The localized heating at \\\\( x_0 \\\\) introduces a Dirac delta function into the initial condition, which modifies the heat distribution uniquely for points in time after \\\\( t_0 \\\\). The evolving heat equation then spreads this point source of heat over the plane, altering the temperature distribution compared to an undisturbed scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
