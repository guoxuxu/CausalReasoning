  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and let the transformation be defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\theta t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being another real constant.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what interventions (such as addition of \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\), changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\), or any other modifications) took place, based solely on the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of interventions and changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\beta \\\\) can result in the same integral value, especially due to the complex interactions between frequency components and their phase relationships over the integration interval. Identifying specific interventions or changes requires more detailed information about the system dynamics than what is provided by the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
