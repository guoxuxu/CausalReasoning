  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We analyze how applying a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants) to the input affects the original function.\n\nIf we observe the output of \\\\( f \\\\) applied to a transformed point \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we determine the original input \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing the parameters of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the pre-transformation complex number \\\\( z \\\\) from \\\\( f(h(z)) \\\\), since multiple pre-transformed values could correspond to the same output due to the effects of the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
