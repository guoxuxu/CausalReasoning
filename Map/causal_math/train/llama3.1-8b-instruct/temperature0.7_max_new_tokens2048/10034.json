  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system is initially affected by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nSeeing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can it be conclusively determined whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation affects the initial condition in a potentially complex and non-invertible way (depending on A), the state at time T has no unique traceability to a specific initial condition without additional information about the presence or parameters of transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
