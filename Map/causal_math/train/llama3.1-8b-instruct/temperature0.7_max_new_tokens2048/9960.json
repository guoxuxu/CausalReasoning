  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\\\lambda u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the state of the system at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) which converts the spatial component to the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether Fourier transform, convolution with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) or both) at earlier times?",
  "Explanation": "Several different functions \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could result in identical effects when convoluted with various initial states, resulting in the same final Fourier transformed state. Without additional information about the path or the specific types of transformations applied, it is not possible to uniquely determine the interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
