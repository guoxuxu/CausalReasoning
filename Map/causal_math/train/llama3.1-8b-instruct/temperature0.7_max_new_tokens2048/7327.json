  "Problem": "Consider a partially observable system where the state at time t, denoted by \\\\( x(t) \\\\), evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx(t) = Cx(t) dt + dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the noise in the system. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nSuppose an intervention in the form of a new transformation \\\\( m(x) = Ex \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is another constant matrix, is applied at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) where \\\\( 0 < t_2 < T \\\\). Will the system's state at \\\\( T \\\\) be influenced only by the transformations \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\), disregarding the matrix \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\), and the underlying system dynamics represented by \\\\( C \\\\), assert their influence on the final state at \\\\( T \\\\). None of the transformations negate the effects of the other inputs, and each contributes to altering the trajectory and observable outcome in concert with the stochastic nature of \\\\( dW(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
