  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where the function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), with C being a real constant. The evolution of the system is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of integral operations and their respective timing, due to complex exponential interactions which can create equivalent effects from differing sequences of applications. It is not possible to confidently back-calculate to identify specifics of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
