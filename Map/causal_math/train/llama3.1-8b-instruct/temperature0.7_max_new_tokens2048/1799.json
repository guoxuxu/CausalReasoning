  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega z} \\\\) is applied at a later time to the boundary conditions, will the resulting potential V within the domain depend solely on the second intervention and ignore effects from \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) does not reset or independently override the effects from the first transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Instead, it further modifies the boundary conditions already influenced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), resulting in a potential that reflects the cumulative effects of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
