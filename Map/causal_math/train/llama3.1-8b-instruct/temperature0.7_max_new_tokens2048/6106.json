  "Problem": "We have a LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system characterized by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Lx(t) = y(t) \\\\). In addition, we consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse transformation applied to \\\\( X(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from the system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) directly without knowing the Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( y(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), and assuming the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is invertible, one can uniquely identify \\\\( x(t) \\\\) directly from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without requiring knowledge about the Laplace transform application, as \\\\( L^{-1}y(t) = x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
