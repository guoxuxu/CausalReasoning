  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different sequences or types of phase shifts due to the nature of complex exponential functions. Multiple intervention combinations can yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), obscuring the exact sequence of phase shifts used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
