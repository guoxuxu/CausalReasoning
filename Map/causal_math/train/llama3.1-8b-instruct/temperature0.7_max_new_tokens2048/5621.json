  "Problem": "Consider a magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} = B_0 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{z} \\\\), acting on a charged particle resulting in the Lorentz force equation \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\vec{v}} = q (\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}) \\\\). We explore the effects of an applied electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} = E_0 \\\\hat{x} \\\\) as a transformation on the particle's motion.\n\nIf the electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) is applied to a particle initially at rest, and then allowed to move under the influence of the magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} \\\\) without further intervention, will the particle's trajectory at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if moved only due to \\\\( \\\\vec{B} \\\\) without \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) alters the initial velocity vector, which in turn affects how the Lorentz force directs the particle's path. The presence of an electric component introduces additional acceleration along the x-axis, modulating the trajectory compared to the magnetic field only condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
