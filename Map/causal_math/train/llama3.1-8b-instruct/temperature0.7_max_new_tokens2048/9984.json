  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent time-dependent real functions. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform on this function and then interpreting the inverse transform without and with interventions.\n\nGiven the outcome in the time domain after combined known and unknown interventions in the Laplace domain, can we conclusively identify the specific interventions applied based only on the observed time-domain function?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions (such as different damping factors, shifts, or other operator modifications) could yield similar time-domain behaviors due to the inherent properties of Laplace transformations and linear systems. Thus, identifying specific interventions based solely on the resultant function is typically infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "interventions → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → z(t); z(t) → time-domain function; time-domain function → interventions"
