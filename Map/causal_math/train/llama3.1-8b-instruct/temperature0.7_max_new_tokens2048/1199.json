  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{−λt}(x + iy) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( λ \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed under the application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and time evolution t.\n\nIf we apply another transformation \\\\( M(z) = cz + d \\\\) as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 entirely depend on the function without considering the effects from \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T will be affected by the initial operator \\\\( L \\\\), the intrinsic properties of the complex function, and the intervention \\\\( M \\\\). Each of these components contributes to the complex trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus the endpoint reflects all these influences, complicating the extraction of individual effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
