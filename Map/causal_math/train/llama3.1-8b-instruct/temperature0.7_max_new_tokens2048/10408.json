  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. To analyze the behavior, we intervene by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\cdot z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant, at a certain time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively ascertain the specific interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The different combinations of phase shifts \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) can lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the properties of complex multiplication. Without additional information on timing or exact phase shifts applied, pinpointing the specific interventions or combinations thereof is unidentifiable solely from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
