  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x' = Lx\\\\) where L is a linear operator. The behavior of this system is analyzed when a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is another linear operator, is applied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0, subsequently evolving under the original system \\\\(x' = Lx\\\\) with no further intervention, will the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at some later time t be identical to that obtained by evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) alone under \\\\(x' = Lx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When applying the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Mx\\\\), the initial state is altered. The new initial state, \\\\(Mx_0\\\\), evolves according to the dynamics dictated by L but from a different starting point, generally yielding a different state at any time t compared to evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) in absence of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
