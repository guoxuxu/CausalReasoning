  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\). Consider applying the transformation by \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf observing \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\), can the original vector \\( x_0 \\) be deduced without knowing whether \\( h(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the transformation \\( h(z) \\), it’s ambiguous whether the observed \\( z(T) \\) comes from \\( e^{AT}x_0 \\) or \\( e^{BT}e^{AT}x_0 \\). The lack of information about \\( B \\) and the non-trivial interaction between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) make retracing to \\( x_0 \\) uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
