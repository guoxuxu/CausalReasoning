  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) in the complex plane, and its transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\). We explore how manipulating the function and its transform affects causal relationships within these systems.\n\nIf we apply a Laplace transform to \\\\( z \\\\) at some point after the Fourier transform, will the resulting function be influenced only by the properties of \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Laplace transform as an intervention introduces additional dependencies not only related to \\\\( w \\\\), but also to the nature and effect of both transformations – Fourier and Laplace. Thus, the final output is a compound effect of all involved mathematical operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
