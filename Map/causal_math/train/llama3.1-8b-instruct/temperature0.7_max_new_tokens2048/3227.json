  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), commonly referred to as the heat equation. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = U(k, t) \\\\), is applied to the system.\n\nIf an intervention by applying an additional variable conductivity modeled by \\\\( k(x) \\\\) occurs at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform \\\\( U(k, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original diffusion equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention altered the basic heat equation by introducing spatially dependent conductivity, resulting in a non-uniform diffusion process. This change does not merely shift or scale the solution but potentially alters it in fundamentally different ways that cannot be derived solely from the original heat dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
