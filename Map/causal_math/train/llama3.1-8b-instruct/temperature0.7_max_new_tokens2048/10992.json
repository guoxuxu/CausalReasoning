  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) - By(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y}(t) = Bx(t) + Ay(t) \\\\), with A and B being constants. Let's examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely identify what transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used on the system, based solely on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in effects from different transformations, particularly when dealing with complex exponential scaling factors which impact both amplitude and phase, makes it challenging to disentangle the specific transformations used to arrive at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple potential paths could lead to the same outcome, rendering exact inference of interventions based only on final state impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
