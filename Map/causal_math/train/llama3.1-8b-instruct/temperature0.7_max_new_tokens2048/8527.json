  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a complex constant. Investigate the influence of the transformation defined by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying effect, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, and C. The transformations by C and B can interdependently affect the pathway and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the endpoint a result of combined influences of A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
