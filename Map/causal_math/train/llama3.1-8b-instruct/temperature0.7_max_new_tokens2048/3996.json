  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a time-dependent input vector and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of introducing a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) over time t, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific intervention (the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) at a given time \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) be identified exactly based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation caused by applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and the effects of matrix A make it difficult to uniquely determine what type of intervention was applied (i.e., the specifics of B or the timing t_1) just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Similar results could be achieved with different B matrices or even different timings of application, due to overlapping effects in the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
