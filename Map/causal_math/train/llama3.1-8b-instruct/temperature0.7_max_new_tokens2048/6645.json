  "Problem": "Investigate the interplay between two functions, \\\\( p(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\) and \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and their effects within the integral transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nWill the application of \\\\( p(z) \\\\) before the transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] \\\\) result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( p(z) \\\\) after the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The non-linear nature of \\\\( p(z) \\\\) will alter the integrand in a way that affects the outcome significantly. Applying \\\\( p(z) \\\\) before the transformation changes the function being integrated, hence the order of application affects the result due to the non-linear transformation of the integrand.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
