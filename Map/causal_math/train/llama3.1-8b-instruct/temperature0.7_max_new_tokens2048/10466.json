  "Problem": "We consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore scenarios involving the integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, to analyze how transformations and interventions affect the system.\n\nFrom observing the integral transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclusively determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if no information is given about the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) in the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) incorporates effects from the exponential term \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) within the transform, which depends on the complex parameter \\\\( s \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( s \\\\), the extraction of the precise initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is obscured since the transform could represent a variety of initial conditions altered by different values of \\\\( s \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
