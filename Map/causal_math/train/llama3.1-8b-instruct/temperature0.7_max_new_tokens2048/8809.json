  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system when subjected to different kernel transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) leading to a convolution integral \\\\( (u*h)(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(\\\\tau)h(t-\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) and its impact on the output used in signal processing.\n\nIf a convolution operation \\\\( (u*h)(t) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without any further transformation and then transformed via Laplace, will the resultant \\\\( U(s) \\\\) match the multiplication of their individual Laplace transforms, i.e., \\\\( U(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Laplace transforms. Hence, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(u*h)(t)\\\\}(s) = U(s)H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This reflects the causality from applying the convolution (cause) to observing the transformed output (effect) as a straightforward multiplicative relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
