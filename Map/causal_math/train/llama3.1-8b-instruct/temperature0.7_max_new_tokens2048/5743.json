  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of functions where the kernel operator K is defined on a function y(x). The relationship between y and its image under K is described through a convolution, i.e., \\\\( K*y = \\\\int h(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\), where h(t) is an impulse response function. We are interested in how the application of Fourier Transform (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) might influence this relationship.\n\nIf an intervention modifies h(t) to a different function g(t) at some time, resulting in a new kernel operation during convolution, does this change the original effect of the Fourier Transform on the relationship between y and K*y?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that changes the impulse response to g(t) alters the convolution operation itself, thus affecting the outcome after the Fourier Transform. The new convolution \\\\( K'*y = \\\\int g(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\) and consequently \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(K'*y) \\\\) will yield results dependent on g(t). The Fourier Transform still linearly interacts, but with a modified kernel.",
