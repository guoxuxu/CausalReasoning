  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a matrix-based system with the equation \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(t) = P\\\\textbf{x}_0 + tQ\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\) are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x}) = e^{Rt}\\\\textbf{x}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) is another constant matrix, at various points in time.\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial vector \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\) by observing \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\) at T, without knowledge of when or if the transformation \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the timing or application of \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\), the transformation could have altered the trajectory in various ways, rendering it impossible to uniquely trace back to \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\), especially since \\\\(e^{Rt}\\\\) may not commute with \\\\(P\\\\) or \\\\(Q\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
