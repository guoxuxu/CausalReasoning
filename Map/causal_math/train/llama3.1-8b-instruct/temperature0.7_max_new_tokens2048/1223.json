  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new damping function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention to the already transformed function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), will the resultant Fourier transform of the combined function at t = T depend exclusively on \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) and not on the values of a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The additional damping factor \\\\( v(t) \\\\) will further modify the spectral components introduced by \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Therefore, the final Fourier transform at t = T is dependent not only on the original function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), but also on the exponential modifications introduced by a and b, affecting the overall transform characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
