  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix and x is a constant complex vector, under the Laplace Transform defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed result \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\\\), can the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) be determined uniquely without prior knowledge of the transformation applied (i.e., knowing that the function is \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\\\) requires explicit knowledge of A and the nature of the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\). Without knowing A, the inverse transform does not yield a unique result, particularly due to potential issues like non-invertibility or deficiencies of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
