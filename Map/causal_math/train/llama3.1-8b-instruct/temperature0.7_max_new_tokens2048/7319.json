  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by the eigenfunction expansion \\\\( u(x, t) = \\\\sum_n a_n(t) \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\), where \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) are the time-dependent coefficients and \\\\( \\\\phi_n(x) \\\\) are the eigenfunctions. An operation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is defined as applying a differential operator, specifically \\\\( F(u) = -\\\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nIf during the evolution at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( G(u) = u + d \\\\) (where d is a constant) is applied, will the resultant function at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the initial application of \\\\( F \\\\) and not on \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) adds a constant to the whole function, altering its subsequent evolution. This change affects how the coefficients \\\\( a_n(t) \\\\) evolve post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) depends on both the initial effect of \\\\( F \\\\) and the mid-way intervention of \\\\( G \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
