  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) on the function u(t).\n\nIf a boundary condition is modified at time t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at s = a reflect this modification compared to the original boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the boundary condition changes the function u(t) from the initial time, thus altering its evolution under the differential operator L. When the Laplace transform is applied, it translates this new evolution into the s-domain, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) that reflects these changes compared to the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
