  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan the exact moment and nature (i.e., value of \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)) of the intervention be deduced solely from knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a single time point \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact timing and value of \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) would require more information than \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a single point. Multiple combinations of timing and adjustment magnitudes possibly yield the same result at \\\\( t \\\\), especially due to the integral's dependence on the entire path of \\\\( \\omega(s) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
