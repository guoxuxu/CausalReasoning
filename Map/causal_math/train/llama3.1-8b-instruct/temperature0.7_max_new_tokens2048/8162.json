  "Problem": "In a controlled heat transfer system, the temperature function, \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to the function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan we accurately recover the original unaltered initial temperature distribution from observing \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t without knowing that function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(x) \\\\), any observed temperature distribution at subsequent times cannot be uniquely traced back to determine the original state before applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\). The impact of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) on the initial conditions obscures the original temperature profile.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
