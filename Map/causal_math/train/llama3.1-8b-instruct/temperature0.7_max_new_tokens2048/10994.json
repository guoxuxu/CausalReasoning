  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where an electrical circuit is represented by a system of linear differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a matrix describing the dynamics of the circuit. The response of this circuit to external stimuli is modeled by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M is a matrix and N is a vector.\n\nCan we determine the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of information about the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), deducing the precise \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is challenging because both the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) and the additive vector \\\\( N \\\\) could significantly alter the initial conditions. Without this knowledge, multiple initial conditions could yield the same \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T under the dynamics \\\\( Dx \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
