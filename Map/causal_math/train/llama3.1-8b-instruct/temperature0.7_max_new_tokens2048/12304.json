  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) until time T, will the result be equivalent to directly using the initial system without applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) introduces an additional rotation by \\\\(e^{iBt}\\\\) at t = 0, which changes the starting point in the complex plane before the evolution under \\\\(e^{iAt}\\\\). This altered starting point generally results in a different endpoint at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
