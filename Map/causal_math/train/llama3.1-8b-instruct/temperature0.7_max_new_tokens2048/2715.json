  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane by \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\). We analyze transformations applied to this function through the linear operator \\\\( L[f(z)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied after the initial transform \\\\( L[f(z)] \\\\), will the resultant transform solely reflect properties of the initial function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) without influence from the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) affects the sequence of transformations applied, meaning the resultant transform will incorporate effects not only from \\\\( e^z \\\\) but also the nonlinear transformation by squaring, which changes the domain and alters the original function’s characteristic behavior within the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
