  "Problem": "Consider the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed over time interval [0, T].\n\nKnowing only the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) over [0, T], can we determine if a phase shift intervention happened, and what the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral provides a single complex number without revealing the specific internal changes such as phase shifts made to the function over the interval. There may be multiple combinations of A and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) producing the same outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
