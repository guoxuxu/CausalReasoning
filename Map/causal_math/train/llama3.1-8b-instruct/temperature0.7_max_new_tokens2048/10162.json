  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) under the action of a differential operator \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y + p(t)x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x + p(t)y \\\\), and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a known function of time t.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be uniquely determined without additional information about intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The unique backward determination of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without any knowledge of the function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) during the interval is not feasible. The system's dependence on \\\\( p(t) \\\\) throughout its evolution introduces inherent uncertainty about past states unless \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is specifically known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
