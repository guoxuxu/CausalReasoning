  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of an external force applied to a mechanical system obeying the second order differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + p\\\\dot{x} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The system is subject to an impulse response represented as a transformation \\\\(g(x) = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are matrices and u denotes the control input.\n\nGiven the observation of state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) before any transformation by \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied, it's impossible to ascertain the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) solely based on the later observation. The transformation may have altered the initial conditions in a way that is untraceable without additional information about B and u.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
