  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations given by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We investigate the influence of a transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\), where M is another matrix and c is a constant vector, on the solution x.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(g(x) = Nx + d\\\\) (where N is a constant matrix and d is a vector) is applied as an intervention, will the final solution vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depend only on A and not on M, N, or their constants c, and d?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(x) = Nx + d\\\\) introduces additional factors that alter the equation to \\\\(A(Nx + d) = b\\\\), which depends critically on the values of N and d, in addition to the initial transformation by M and c. As a result, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depends on these matrices and vectors, altering the solution path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
