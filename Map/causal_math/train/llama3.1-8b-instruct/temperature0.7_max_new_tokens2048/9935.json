  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the integral transform \\( I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant complex function. This scenario explores how varying \\( s \\) and operations on \\( f(t) \\) affects the transformation result.\n\nIf a scaling operation \\( g(t) = k \\cdot e^{At} \\) is applied as an intervention at some point with \\( k \\) being a constant, does \\( I(s) \\) remain solely dependent on \\( s \\) and \\( A \\), disregarding \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling intervention modifies \\( f(t) \\) to \\( g(t) = k \\cdot e^{At} \\) which impacts \\( I(s) \\), making it \\( k \\) times the integral of the original \\( e^{At} \\), showing dependency on \\( k \\), in addition to \\( s \\) and \\( A \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
