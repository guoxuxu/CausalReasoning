  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze changes in solution behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = e^{\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the scaling effect \\\\( e^{\\\\omega t} \\\\) on the evolution of the initial conditions cannot be uniquely reversed, as different values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could yield the same final state after scaling differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
