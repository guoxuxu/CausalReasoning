  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the function state at time T, can we unambiguously determine if the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied and at what time without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, and at which point, just from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging without further data. The resultant state could be due to complex combinations of natural evolution and integral intervention effects, especially if multiple applications or durations of \\\\( T \\\\) could hypothetically yield similar results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
