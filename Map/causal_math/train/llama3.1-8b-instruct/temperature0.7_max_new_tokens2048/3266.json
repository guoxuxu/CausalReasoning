  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function u(x, t) and consider its evolution under the given differential equation.\n\nCan we accurately reconstruct \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(k, T) \\\\) using only the inverse Fourier transform, without knowledge of any evolution specifics or initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( u(k, T) \\\\), the inverse Fourier transform can accurately reconstruct \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). By understanding the properties of the partial differential equation and its linear characteristics, one can trace backwards to deduce \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) accurately, assuming no external influences alter the fundamental evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
