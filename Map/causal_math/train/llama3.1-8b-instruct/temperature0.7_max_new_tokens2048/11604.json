  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz + u \\\\) with \\\\( u \\\\) being a control function and \\\\( D \\\\) a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform outcome \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after interventions with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), can we definitively identify which control function was applied at what times simply by analyzing \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform \\\\( g(z) \\\\) reflects combined influences of the control functions and the matrix \\\\( D \\\\). Due to the nature of superposition in linear systems and the transformation properties of Laplace, multiple different scenarios of control function applications (i.e., times, types, magnitudes) might yield the same \\\\( g(z) \\\\), making it impossible to distinctly backtrack to specific interventions without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
