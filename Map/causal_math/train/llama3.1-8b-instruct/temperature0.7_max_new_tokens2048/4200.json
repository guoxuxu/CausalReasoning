  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nCan we determine if either the Fourier or the inverse Fourier transform (or both) were applied during the evolution to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by examining the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), knowing only that the system was initially governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention and transformation sequences can lead to similar or even identical final states \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the properties of Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms. The non-uniqueness of these transformations in the context of their interaction with the linear operator means that determining the specific interventions from the final state alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
