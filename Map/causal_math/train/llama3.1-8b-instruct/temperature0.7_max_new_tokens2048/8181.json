  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) right after applying the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) differ from directly applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with parameter \\\\( s-a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace Transform to \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( L(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{at} f(t) e^{-st} dt = L(s-a) \\\\) of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Thus, transforming \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or directly adjusting the Laplace Transform parameter of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( s-a \\\\) yields the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
