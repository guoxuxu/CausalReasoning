  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the output's Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and knowing the intervention used (the filter \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied), can we determine whether the original system's response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was used prior to intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the presence of the original impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) without extra information about either \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) \\\\) or additional frequency-specific information is challenging because the transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflects the compounded effect of both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Thus, ambiguity remains regarding whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was used as it is compounded with the effects of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
