  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without confirmation whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the initial position \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The function \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) could have altered the trajectory significantly, thus without this knowledge, accurate inference of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is mathematically infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
