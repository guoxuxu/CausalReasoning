  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The effect of an external input characterized by the matrix function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) is analyzed, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can it be determined exactly which interventions occurred (whether \\\\( u(t) \\\\), \\\\( v(x) \\\\), or neither), just based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing M?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could be reached by various combinations of interventions with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x) \\\\), or direct evolution under M. The overlapping influences and the potential equivalences in trajectories due to the non-uniqueness of exponential matrix effects make it difficult to precisely identify the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
