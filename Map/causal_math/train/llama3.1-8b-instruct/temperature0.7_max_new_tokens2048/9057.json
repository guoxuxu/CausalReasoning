  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) is applied to the equation without any changes to \\\\( u(t) \\\\), will \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be different from \\\\( Dz(T) = DC \\\\int_0^T \\\\exp(A(s-T))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) is equivalent to transforming the output by D, and since the operation on u(t) has not been altered, the resultant \\\\( w(T) \\\\) directly equals \\\\( Dz(T) \\\\), following the linearity of the integral and matrix multiplication.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
