  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). A boundary condition modification is introduced by the function \\\\(f(u) = u + k\\\\sin(u)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant, defined on the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\).\n\nGiven the observed solution \\\\( u(x) \\\\) inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), can we accurately determine the sequence and type of boundary transformations (\\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) that were applied over time?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modify the boundary in potentially overlapping ways, deducing the exact transformations used without additional information is impossible. The nonlinear nature of the transformations introduces complexity that prevents unambiguous reconstruction of which transformations were applied at which times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
