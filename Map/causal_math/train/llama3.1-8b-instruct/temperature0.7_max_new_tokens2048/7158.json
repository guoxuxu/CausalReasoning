  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) which represents the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) applicable over the domain of complex numbers for \\\\( z \\\\). The system's behavior is analyzed by varying the complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) and examining the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2u(z) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to precisely reconstruct the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from knowing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) if we have no information about the initial transformation on \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) requires not only the inversion of the Laplace transform, but also accurate knowledge of how \\\\( z \\\\) was treated. Lack of details on whether or how \\\\( z \\\\) was transformed (e.g., squared) before being applied in \\\\( u(z) \\\\) makes it infeasible to uniquely identify \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
