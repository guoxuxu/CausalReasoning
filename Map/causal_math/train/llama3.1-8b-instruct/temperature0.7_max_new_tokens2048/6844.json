  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) where \\( t \\) is time and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. Using an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, we wish to analyze how modifications to the original function impact its behavior over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z'(t) \\) at any \\( t > t_1 \\) where an intervention has been applied, can we determine specifically whether the intervention was the multiplication by \\( e^{at} \\), solely based on the value of \\( z'(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function \\( z'(t) \\) could have been affected by various possible interventions, not limited to multiplication by \\( e^{at} \\). Without explicit information about the intervention or additional boundary conditions, it is ambiguous to pinpoint \\( a \\) as the sole influence, particularly given the general form \\( e^{ct} \\) where \\( c \\) could match multiple potential complex numbers.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
