  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\) where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + Nu\\\\), with constant matrices M and N and control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\). We explore how this integral transformation affects causal inference in different scenario contexts.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) accurately from the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) obtained at some time T, assuming no input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The information about \\\\(z_0\\\\) is integrated and diffused over time across the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\). Given the exponential decay and integration, multiple initial conditions can lead to similar results in \\\\(h(z)\\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) just from \\\\(h(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
