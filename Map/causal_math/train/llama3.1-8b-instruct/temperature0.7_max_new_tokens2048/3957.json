  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = T under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\). The evolutionary path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is changed due to this modification, leading to a trajectory based on the altered initial condition, with exponential dependence on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in addition to the oscillatory behavior due to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
