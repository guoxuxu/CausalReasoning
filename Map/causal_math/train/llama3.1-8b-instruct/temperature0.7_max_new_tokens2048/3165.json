  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We analyze the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, applied to the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the initial boundary conditions and then the system is allowed to evolve under Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the potential function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) within the domain at a later time still satisfy Laplace’s equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the boundary conditions does not alter the form of Laplace's equation, which remains valid as a description of the potential function within the domain. The Fourier transform only changes the representation of the boundary values without affecting the harmonicity of the potential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
