  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant, and an integral transformation \\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\). We study how the transformation influences the properties of function \\( f \\) over complex domain.\n\nCan the original complex function \\( f(z) \\) be perfectly deduced from knowing \\( T[f](s) \\) for all \\( s \\) in a complex domain?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( T[f](s) \\) provides information primarily related to the behavior of \\( f \\) along the real axis impressed by \\( e^{-st} \\). While significant information about \\( f \\) is captured, unique restoration of \\( f(z) \\) over the entirety of the complex plane from \\( T[f](s) \\) alone may omit certain specificities not reflected in reductions along the real-interval, such as localized behavior in complex domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
