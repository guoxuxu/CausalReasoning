  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) is a function of space and time. An integral transformation particularly the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\) is considered to observe the behavior of the system in the frequency domain over time.\n\nCan we determine the exact nature of the intervention (type of filter \\\\( G(k) \\\\) applied or not) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) solely by observing the final frequency state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed frequency state at \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) can result from different potential sequences of interventions, as the effects of filtering might overlap with other dynamic changes governed by \\\\( L \\\\). The non-uniqueness and potential equivalence of the spectral outcomes under different interventions lead to ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
