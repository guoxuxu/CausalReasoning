  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of complex functions, where each function obeys the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. We explore how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}u(x)dx\\\\), influences the solutions.\n\nIf after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\(u(x)\\\\), we multiply the result by a function \\\\(g(s) = e^{-as}\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) and then transform it back, will the resulting spatial function still satisfy the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\(e^{-as}\\\\) and then taking the inverse transform essentially translates the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\), resulting in \\\\(u(x-a)\\\\). The translated function still satisfies the same homogeneous differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), thereby preserving the nature of solutions to the equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
