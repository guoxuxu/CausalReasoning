  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), on the evolution of the system over time.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\), is it possible to precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(x_0)\\\\), \\\\(Mx(t)\\\\) at t = t1, or both) based solely on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome at \\\\(x(T)\\\\) might result from various combinations of the initial Fourier transform and the mid-time intervention by M. Due to the linear nature of the system, it is not possible to uniquely reconstruct the pathway (transformations) from the endpoint state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
