  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on a linear algebra operation where \\\\( z \\\\) is mapped under \\\\( A \\\\), a square matrix. The transformation is given by the matrix exponential \\\\( h(A) = e^{A} \\\\). We explore how these transformations interact and evolve over time.\n\nFor an initial matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a scalar \\\\( z_0 \\\\), if we apply \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) first and then transform using \\\\( h(A) \\\\), will the result be equivalent to applying \\\\( h(A) \\\\) first and then computing the exponential of the eigenvalues of \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ordering of function application matters due to non-commutativity of matrix operations. Applying \\\\( g(z_0) \\\\) first affects each element of the matrix differently compared to applying \\\\( h(A) \\\\) to \\\\( A \\\\) and then exponentiating the eigenvalues. The transformation paths and outcomes differ due to the matrix exponential properties.",
