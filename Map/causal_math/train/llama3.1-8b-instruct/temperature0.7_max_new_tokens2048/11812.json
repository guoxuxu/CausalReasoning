  "Problem": "Consider a function space defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). We explore the implications of using an inverse Laplace transform \\\\( f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} \\\\) and applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = tf(t) \\\\) in this space.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes transformation to \\\\( g(t) = tf(t) \\\\) and is then transformed via the Laplace transform, will \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\\\) be obtained simply by modifying \\\\( F(s) \\\\) with pre-determined operations analytically derived from properties of the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Using the property of the Laplace transform, specifically the transformation for \\\\( t^n f(t) \\\\), where the nth derivative of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) with respect to \\\\( s \\\\) multiplies by \\\\( (-1)^n \\\\), we see that \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{tf(t)\\}(s) = -F'(s) \\\\). This signifies that applying \\\\( g(t) = tf(t) \\\\) and then transforming leads to a derivative operation, which is a direct, predictable modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
