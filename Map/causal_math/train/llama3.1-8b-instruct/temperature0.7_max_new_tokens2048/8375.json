  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. The impact of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this function is considered.\n\nIf an intervention applies an additional Laplace transform described by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{w(t)\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} + s\\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be affected by this intervention assuming no further transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the term \\\\( s \\\\) (a constant in the s-domain) modifies the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which can change the function after applying the inverse transform. Hence, the intervention alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
