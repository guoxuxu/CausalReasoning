  "Problem": "Assume we have a function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\). Also, suppose an integral transformation of this function using a contour in the complex plane specified as \\\\(T[f(z)] = \\\\int_C f(z) dz\\\\) where C is a semicircular contour from -R to R in the upper half-plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is initially determined by \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) without any modifications and is integrated over the contour C, will its transformation \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\) be affected by altering the radius R of the contour C?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the radius R of the contour C affects the values of z squared, thus changing the function \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) over different points along the path. This directly impacts the result of the integral transformation, showing a clear cause (change in R) to effect (alteration in \\\\(T[f(z)]\\\\)) relation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
