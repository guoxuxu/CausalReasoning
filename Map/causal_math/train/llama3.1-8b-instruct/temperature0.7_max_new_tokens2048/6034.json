  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions related to the real and imaginary parts of a complex function subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) obtained at s = a, can we infer with certainty whether the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) were doubled if we do not know the applied transformation?",
  "Explanation": "If the specifics of the transformation (like scaling of initial conditions or the nature of any other modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)) are unknown, multiple modifications could result in the same transformed output, making exact inference about the initial conditions impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
