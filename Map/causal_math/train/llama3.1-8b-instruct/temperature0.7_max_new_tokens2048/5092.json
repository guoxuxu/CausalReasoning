  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a system matrix and B is a control matrix, coupled with a control input u. We analyze the impact of applying a state-dependent transformation \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original transformation (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied or not) and the magnitude or type of control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original transformation and control inputs solely based on the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the multiple influences (system dynamics, initial transformation, and control strategy) contributing to the final state. Different combinations of initial conditions, transformations, and control inputs may yield the same final state, creating unresolvable ambiguity without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
