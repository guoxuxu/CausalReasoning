  "Problem": "Evaluate the nonlinear system governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = z^n + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function of a real variable \\\\( t \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, and \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider transformations using a function \\\\( h(z) = z^{m} \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is an integer, applied at different time points.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively identify the specific times and types of interventions (such as \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) applied during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Various interventions could potentially result in the same endpoint due to the complex and nonlinear nature of the equation. Multiple combinations of timing and transformation parameters (value of \\\\( m \\\\)) could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), thus making it impossible to uniquely backtrack and identify specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
