  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the result of applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to the squared frequency domain representation of \\\\( X(s) \\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and confirm whether the non-linear operation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and confirming the operation solely from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is impractical because squaring in frequency domain alters the components in ways that cannot be unambiguously separated from the effects of the filter. The overlapping influences of squaring and filtering make it unclear whether and how the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
