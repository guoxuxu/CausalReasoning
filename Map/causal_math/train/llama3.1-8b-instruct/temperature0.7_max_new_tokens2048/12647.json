  "Problem": "Investigate the effect of impulse action in a heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) on a domain \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative of u, and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian. The intervention is represented by applying a function \\\\( g(u) = u + h \\\\delta(x-x_0) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( h \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( x_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitely determine whether an impulse was applied, and if so, can we find out the exact parameters \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, although anomalies in the distribution in \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) might suggest an intervention, the complexities due to diffusion and possibly similar effects from different parameters (different combinations of \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( x_0 \\\\)) can obscure the exact nature or existence of the impulse.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
