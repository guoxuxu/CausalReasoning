  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the frequency domain, is it possible to conclusively determine whether any interventions like \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) were applied, merely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations into the frequency domain, particularly when combined or applied sequentially (and considering non-linear transformations like squaring the frequency), create complex interactions that embed and overlap various transformations' effects. These interactions usually prevent a clear and unambiguous identification of which transformations or interventions were indeed used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
