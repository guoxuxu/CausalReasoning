  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\), where A is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and considering the influence of \\\\( A \\\\) in the transformation, the original conditions set by \\\\( z_0 \\\\) have been integrated and potentially obscured by the complexities of the matrix exponentials. Tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is unfeasible without specific details on \\\\( A \\\\) and its application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
