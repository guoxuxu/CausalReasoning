  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of an electrical system characterized by the function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\), where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is the initial voltage and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Let \\\\( T(V) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty V(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) describe a Laplace transformation of the voltage signal over time.\n\nIf an intervention occurs at a specific time, altering \\\\( V(t) \\\\) to \\\\( V(t) + V_i(t) \\\\), where \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) is an induced voltage, will the Laplace transform \\\\( T(V) \\\\) depend solely on the original system parameters and not on the nature of \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the total voltage function to \\\\( V(t) + V_i(t) \\\\), which significantly alters the profile of the Laplace transform. The transform \\\\( T(V) \\\\) will include contributions from both the original and the induced voltage functions, thus depending on the nature of \\\\( V_i(t) \\\\) as well as the original parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
