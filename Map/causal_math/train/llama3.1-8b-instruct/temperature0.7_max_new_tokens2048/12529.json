  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nAfter observing \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\), can we deduce whether g(x) was applied to a previous value of x without further information?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\) only reveals the current state, not how x attained that value. Since \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\) is not injective due to its quadratic nature, multiple transformations or direct evaluations might lead to the same \\( y \\), obscuring the causal path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
