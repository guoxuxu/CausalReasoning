  "Problem": "We consider the Fourier transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(t, s) \\\\. The system analysis involves altering the input signal using a transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at}u(t, x) \\\\) where a is a constant, and observing the impact on the resulting Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform at t = T, can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( v(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the transformed function at T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the exponential damping functions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) can result in similar or identical spectral outputs for different configurations of a and b. This ambiguity in resulting transformations makes it impossible to uniquely identify the application sequence or specific values of a and b used during the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
