  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) on a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This leads to a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t) \\\\). The operation is analyzed in the context of the Laplace transform domain, where both functions are transformed and then manipulated algebraically.\n\nHaving observed the transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and knowing the effect of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we reliably infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) just by examining \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, it is possible to recover \\\\( X(s) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) by exactly reversing the frequency shift introduced by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). This reverse transformation is a fundamental property of the Laplace transform under linear time-invariant transformations, allowing for exact inference of \\\\( X(s) \\\\) from the product transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
