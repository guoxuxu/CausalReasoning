  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf only the Fourier transformed result \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) is known to peak at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega \\\\), can we deduce that the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The peaking of \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) indicates that the original function had a frequency component of \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Due to the properties of the Fourier transform, it is the exclusive frequency of the original oscillating function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
