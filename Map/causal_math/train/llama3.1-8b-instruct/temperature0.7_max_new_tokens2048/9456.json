  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at T, influenced by potential phase changes from B and C, could result from several different intervention combinations or timings. The effects of \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) on the phase of \\\\( z \\\\) make it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions from the final state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
