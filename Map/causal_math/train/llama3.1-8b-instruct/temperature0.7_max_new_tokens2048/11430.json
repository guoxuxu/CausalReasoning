  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nGiven the spectrum obtained from the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at an arbitrary time T, can we infer the exact form of \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a simple harmonic function, the Fourier transform will consistently reveal the same frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), independent of the time at which it is measured. The spectral content precisely indicates the frequency defining \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
