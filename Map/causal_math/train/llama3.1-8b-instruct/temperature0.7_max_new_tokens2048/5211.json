  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Analyze the changes induced by performing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function, leading to the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf an additional scaling operation \\\\( S(t) = t z(t) \\\\) is applied after the initial function but prior to the Fourier transform, will this intervention mask the information about the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling operation modifies the function to \\\\( S(t) = t e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), altering the Fourier transform outcome. This results in a derivative of a delta function (indicating a frequency shift) alongside the original frequency, thus blurring the direct observation of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and increasing complexity in the effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
