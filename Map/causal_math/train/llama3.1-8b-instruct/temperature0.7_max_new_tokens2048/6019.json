  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\), obeying the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = Au \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = Bv \\), respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\) on this complex function over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention applying a new transformation \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\mu s} z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( \\mu \\) is a constant) is introduced, will the endpoint \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the differential equations and not on \\( \\lambda \\) or \\( \\mu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) \\) as an intervention modifies the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), making the final transformed function dependent on both \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\), as these parameters dictate the nature of their respective transformations and influence the overall result at time \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
