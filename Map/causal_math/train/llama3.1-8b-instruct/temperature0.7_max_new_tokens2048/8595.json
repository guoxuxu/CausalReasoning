  "Problem": "Consider the impact of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) and how it behaves when inverse transformed under different modifications.\n\nIf the Laplace-transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is modified by multiplying with \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) and then inverse transformed, will the resulting function in the time domain represent \\\\( \\\\int_0^t g(u) du \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) in the frequency domain corresponds to integration in the time domain. Thus, transforming \\\\( G(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) back will yield the integral of the original function \\\\( g(t) = te^{2t} \\\\) over time, from 0 to t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
