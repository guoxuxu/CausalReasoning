  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical scenario where a signal x(t) undergoes a Fourier Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt\\\\). Further, this transformed signal is modified via a filter function H(ω), and the composite effect \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is obtained by applying the Inverse Fourier Transform to \\\\(H(\\\\omega) \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nAfter observing y(t) at time T, can we uniquely determine x(t) at time 0 without knowledge of H(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the filter function H(ω), y(t) can represent multiple possible x(t) due to the modification effects of unknown H(ω). This scenario lacks sufficient information to uniquely backtrack to x(t) from y(t).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
