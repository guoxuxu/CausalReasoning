  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the heat conductivity coefficient, and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Let's analyze the introduction of an external heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\), which varies over time and space, via the modification of the equation to \\\\(u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u + h(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T is known, can we determine whether a heat source \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) was applied at any prior time up to T without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Given the temperature distribution at a single time point, it's impossible to uniquely determine whether changes in distribution were due to an initial condition, the inherent properties of the heat equation, or external sources, unless additional information on the system's evolution is provided.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
