  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a fixed frequency. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\) is examined over this function, both with and without additional transformations.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), can we determine the specific value of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) without any additional information about the original function's form?",
  "Explanation": "Although the transformation is specific to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) via \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\\\), determining \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) uniquely from \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\) alone without knowing that \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) is impossible as similar forms could yield comparable transformation results, leading to ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
