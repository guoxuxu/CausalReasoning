  "Problem": "Consider a function representing a complex variable transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency, and z is a complex variable. We are considering the evolution of this transformation over time t and its impact when combined with an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( G(z(T)) \\\\), can it be determined exactly which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the output at T?",
  "Explanation": "The elements introduced by both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will be amalgamated in the integral, affecting both magnitude and phase. Due to the overlapping effects and the complexity of the integrations, it is challenging to reversibly deduce the precise interventions from the final state without prior knowledge of the transformations applied during the period.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
