  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\) on this system, considering both forward and reverse implications in variable transformations.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = 0 and repeatedly solving the transformed equation \\\\(sU(s) - u(0) = LU(s)\\\\) lead to observations identical to solving \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) directly for u(t) over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is a linear operation that preserves the dynamics described by the differential operator when transformed appropriately. Solving the equation in the Laplace domain and transforming back gives results consistent with direct time-domain solutions, assuming correct handling of initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
