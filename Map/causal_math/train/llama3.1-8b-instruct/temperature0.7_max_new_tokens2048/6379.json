  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(z(s)\\) defined over the complex plane and involving a parameter \\(s = x + yi\\) (where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit). We are particularly interested in investigating how the transformation \\(H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\\) (a Laplace transform) behaves with changes in the function \\(f(t)\\) used in the transform.\n\nIf an intervention changes \\(t\\) in the Laplace transform to \\(t^2\\), thus transforming \\(f(t)\\) to \\(f(t^2)\\), will the final value of \\(H(s)\\) be independent of this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\(t\\) to \\(t^2\\) in the function \\(f(t)\\) fundamentally alters the form of the integral in the Laplace transform. Given that Laplace transforms are highly sensitive to the functional form of \\(f(t)\\) in relation to \\(t\\), \\(H(s)\\) for \\(f(t^2)\\) will be distinctly different from the original, reflecting the altered rate of decay and growth patterns in \\(f(t^2)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
