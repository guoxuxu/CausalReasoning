  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nGiven a nonzero integral result, can we determine that the contour must have enclosed the singularity \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the integral over a contour of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\) is nonzero, it indicates the presence of the singularity \\\\( a \\\\) within the enclosed area of the contour, based on the residue theorem. This is because the nonzero result arises from the contribution of residues at singular points enclosed by the contour.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
