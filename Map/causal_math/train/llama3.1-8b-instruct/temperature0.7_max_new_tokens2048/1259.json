  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex constant, in the context of an integral transformation. We are particularly interested in the causality analysis between transformations and original functions.\n\nIf an additional linear operator defined by a matrix M is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, does the resulting transform solely depend on A?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a linear operator M modifies the function to \\\\( Mg(t) = Me^{At} \\\\) before transformation. The Laplace transform will now depend on the interaction of M and A, not just A, due to the altered characteristics of the function through M's influence on the original exponential signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
