  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 = Hx_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly transformed to t = T under \\\\( z = Hx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) initially changes the state of \\\\( z \\\\) from \\\\( Hx_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Dt}Hx_0 \\\\), altering the evolution trajectory of the system. Because D could fundamentally interact with H to create a distinct state at any later time T, the path and resulting state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ from not applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
