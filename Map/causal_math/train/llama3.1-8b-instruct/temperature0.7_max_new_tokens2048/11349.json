  "Problem": "Let's analyze the behavior of a particle moving in a complex potential field described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = p(t) + iq(t)\\\\) where \\\\(p(t)\\\\) and \\\\(q(t)\\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates in a plane and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = -i\\\\omega z + F(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\(F(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent force function.\n\nIf the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) is given and the system evolves according to the differential equation without any other interventions, will the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory purely depend on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory is determined solely by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the absence of any external intervention. The function \\\\(F(t)\\\\) may affect the radius or the center of the orbital path but not the fundamental frequency, which is governed by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
