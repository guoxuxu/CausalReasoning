  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to a value \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) with no further action, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was just evolved under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) without applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time t = 0 modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 e^{\\\\alpha \\\\cdot 0} = z_0 \\\\), and from this point, the solution evolves differently due to the exponentiation by \\\\( \\\\alpha t \\\\), which alters the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, resulting in a different final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
