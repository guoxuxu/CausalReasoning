  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) in the complex plane, where A is a real constant and i represents the imaginary unit. The function describes rotation around the origin with angular velocity A. We explore different transformations involving the operator \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, and examine the trajectories and causality in this rotating system.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = 0 resulting in \\\\( z_0^k \\\\), and then left to evolve under the rotation defined by \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some future time T show a simple rotation pattern as if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially raises the starting value to the k-th power, which changes its angular position and magnitude in the complex plane. The rotation will proceed from this new position, and the trajectory will not simply be that of the unaltered \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting both the angular velocity and the path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
