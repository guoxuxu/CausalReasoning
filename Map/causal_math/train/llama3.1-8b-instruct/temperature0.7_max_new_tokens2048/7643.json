  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( j(z) = z^m \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another positive integer) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( n \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) = z^m \\\\) further modifies the trajectory, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\), as well as \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The exponents accumulate, reflecting the compound transformations applied sequentially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
