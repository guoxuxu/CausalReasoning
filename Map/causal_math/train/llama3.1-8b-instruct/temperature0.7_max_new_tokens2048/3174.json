  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nGiven the output \\( z(t) \\) obtained from applying the Laplace transform to \\( x(t) \\), can we infer the original \\( x(t) \\) without knowing any modifications like \\( m(t) \\) were applied to \\( x(t) \\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of prior modifications such as \\( m(t) \\) application, it is impossible to correctly infer \\( x(t) \\) from \\( z(t) \\). The modification could alter \\( x(t) \\) in various ways, making it indistinguishable and non-recoverable based solely on \\( z(t) \\) and \\( H(s) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
