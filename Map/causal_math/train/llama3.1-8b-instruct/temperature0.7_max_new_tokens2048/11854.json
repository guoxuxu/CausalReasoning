  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governing complex oscillations, defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Analyzing the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the potential recovery of original conditions.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the ultimate form of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) independent of the original \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the effective dynamics governed by the differential equation. Even if the system was initially influenced by \\\\( k \\\\), the change to \\\\( k' \\\\) affects the subsequent evolution, making \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend not only on the new value \\\\( k' \\\\) but also on the initial conditions and original \\\\( k \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
