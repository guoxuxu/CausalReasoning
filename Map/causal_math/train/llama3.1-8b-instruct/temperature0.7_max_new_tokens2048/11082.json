  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be precisely inferred from the transformed function \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\) without any additional information about the transformation or function?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of how the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) and the functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) interact, it is generally not feasible to uniquely and accurately determine \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\) alone due to the transformation's potential to alter or obscure frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
