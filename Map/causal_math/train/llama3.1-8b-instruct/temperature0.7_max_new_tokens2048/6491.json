  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + i v(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), respectively. We aim to explore the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional function \\\\( w(t) = a u(t) + i b v(t) \\\\) (where a and b are constants) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then transformed, will the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be a straightforward linear combination of the transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the Laplace Transform ensures that the transform of a linear combination of functions is the same combination of the transforms. Therefore, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the addition of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and transformation would be the linear combination of the individual transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
