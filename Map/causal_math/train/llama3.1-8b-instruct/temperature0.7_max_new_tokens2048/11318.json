  "Problem": "We are given a complex system where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) modifies a vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a vector space over the complex numbers. The angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is constant, and the system evolves according to the operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x = -i\\omega x \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system with and without interventions involving a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) and the evolution operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x \\\\) are harmoniously aligned and merely rotate the phase of the vector, the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) can be accurately determined from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by reversing the phase shift.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
