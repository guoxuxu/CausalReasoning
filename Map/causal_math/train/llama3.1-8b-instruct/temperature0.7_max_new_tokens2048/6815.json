  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex domain. We assess the effect of applying a Laplace Transform, indicated by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to a transformed function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf a function transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time t = 0, and then the function is subjected to Laplace Transform, does the resulting transformed function in the s-domain depend only on the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( t^2 \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform fundamentally alters the resulting transform, embedding the characteristics of the polynomial multiplication \\\\( t^2 \\\\) into the transformed function. This affects the region of convergence and alters the poles and zeroes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
