  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where input signals are transformed via a complex function \\\\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z-1} \\\\\\) and then processed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}u(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\\\( a > 0 \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( u(t) \\\\\\) being the unit step function. The transformation due to \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) occurs in the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\), can we precisely determine if \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) was applied to the original signal without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The output at time \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) alone, without further knowledge of the input or the intermediate states, does not provide enough information to confirm whether \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) was applied due to the potential similarity in outputs from different inputs when processed by \\\\\\( g(t) \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of h(z) to the original signal is not directly observable from the output at T without additional information because the effect of h(z) is filtered by g(t) and a."
