  "Problem": "Consider a system which can be modeled by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), shifting through complex numbers in a unit circle over time. An external transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nKnowing the path \\\\(z(T) = ce^{iT}\\\\) at any time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine if the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By examining the magnitude of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), which is \\\\(|c|\\\\), we can infer if \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) was applied. If \\\\(|c|\\\\) is not equal to 1, it indicates that the transformation modifying the initial unit magnitude was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
