  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by a linear differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effects of introducing a modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) = V(t) + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we precisely determine what interventions were used (such as the type of voltage source or changes in resistance) by just analyzing \\\\( I(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The current at time T can result from various configurations and interventions. Due to superposition effects in linear systems and potential similarities in responses to different inputs or interventions, it is not possible to retroactively determine each specific intervention or initial condition uniquely based on \\\\( I(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
