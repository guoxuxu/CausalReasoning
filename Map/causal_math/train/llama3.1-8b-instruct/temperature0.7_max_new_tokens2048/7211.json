  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of an electrical circuit where the resistance R(t) can change over time, and the voltage across the resistor V(t) is given by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = I(t) R(t) \\\\), where I(t) represents the current. We explore the cases under the transformation defined by multiplying the current by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(I) = e^{i\\omega t}I(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where the current is further adjusted by another function \\\\( g(I) = e^{-i\\omega t}I(t) \\\\), will the endpoint voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original R(t) and not on the transformations made by f(I) or g(I)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(I) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, potentially counteracting or enhancing the effects of the transformation by \\\\( f(I) \\\\). The final voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the transformations which can modify both the magnitude and phase of the current in ways dependent on the timing and nature of those transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
