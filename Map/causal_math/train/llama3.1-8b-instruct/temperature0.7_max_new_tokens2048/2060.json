  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is a function in time. This model explores the transformation of x(t) into z(x) over a period T, focusing on its impact in a linear system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Bx \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact nature of the intervention (specific form of M) applied to x(t) only by examining the output \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation to derived \\\\( z(x) \\\\) incorporates M into the evolution under \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). Since multiple different matrices M might result in function shapes that lead to the same or similarly transformed outputs in terms of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely identify M only from the endpoint due to potential equivalence under the integration and transformation process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
