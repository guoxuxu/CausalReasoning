  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex vector. The function is subject to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}w(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows its natural evolution according to the complex function without further modifications, will \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\) to \\\\( x \\\\) evolved under \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\) up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\) affects the vector field by integrating with the exponent matrix \\\\( B \\\\), which changes the developmental path compared to the natural evolution of \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\). The non-commutativity of the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) generally results in different outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
