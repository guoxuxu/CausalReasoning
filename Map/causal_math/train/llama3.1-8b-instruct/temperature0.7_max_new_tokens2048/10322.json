  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore the behavior of this function under the Laplace transform and its inverse, especially when analyzing causality both ways between input and output functions.\n\nCan the specific matrix \\\\( A \\\\) be identified uniquely by examining the characteristics of the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(x)\\\\} \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "While the general form and characteristics of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) can be inferred from its Laplace transform, deducing the exact matrix \\\\( A \\\\) solely from \\\\( L\\\\{z(x)\\\\} \\\\) isn't possible without additional constraints or information about \\\\( A \\\\), as multiple matrices might generate transforms with similar features.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
