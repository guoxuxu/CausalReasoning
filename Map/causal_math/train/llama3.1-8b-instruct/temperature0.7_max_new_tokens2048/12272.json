  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing dynamic states of a system, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. A transformation defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a complex constant matrix is introduced.\n\nWithout further intervention, if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the system's original dynamics, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the state at a later time T, be equivalent to the result of evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under the combined original dynamics of x and y?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by multiplying \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), thus introducing a new dynamic dependent on the properties of C alongside A and B. The time evolution of both parameters leads to a state at time T that deviates from the original trajectory without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
