  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( v(x) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\(a\\\\), it is not possible to determine the contribution of the \\\\(ax\\\\) term to the observed \\\\(v(x)\\\\). Hence, one cannot uniquely deduce \\\\(u(x)\\\\) from \\\\(v(x)\\\\) because multiple combinations of \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) could result in the same \\\\(v(x)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
