  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real-valued parameter. We explore different transformations including the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) without knowing the input function explicitly when s=i?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\(\\int_0^\\infty e^{-it} e^{it} \\, dt\\) converges to a specific form that differs from the original exponential functional behavior, obscuring the oscillatory nature of \\( e^{it} \\) and preventing exact reconstruction without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
