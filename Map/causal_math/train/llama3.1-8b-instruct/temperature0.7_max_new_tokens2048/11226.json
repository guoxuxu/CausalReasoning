  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), on this function over the frequency domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) directly and uniquely from observing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) produced by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)(z(t))?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a peak in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) at a specific point directly indicates the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The relationship is 1-to-1, allowing for a direct inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
