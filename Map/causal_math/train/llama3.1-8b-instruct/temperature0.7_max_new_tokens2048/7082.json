  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is an input signal and \\\\(s\\\\) the complex frequency variable. The system can be studied with an input modification where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(y) = y(t-a) \\\\), for some delay constant \\\\(a\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact delay \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( y(t-a) \\\\) after observing \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) without prior information about the use of \\\\( f(y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( a \\\\) directly from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) requires knowledge that a delay was applied. Without understanding that \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was involved, interpreting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) might lead to multiple candidates corresponding to various transformations of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), especially if additional factors like scaling are considered. This ambiguity makes the sole determination of \\\\( a \\\\) impossible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
