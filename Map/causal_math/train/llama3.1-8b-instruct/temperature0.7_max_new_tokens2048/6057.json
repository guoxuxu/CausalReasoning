  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time evolving according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + kz \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) as real constants. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-st}z(\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting at t = 0 and left to evolve under the described differential equation, will \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T be influenced directly by changes in \\\\( k \\\\) while holding \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) constant?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\\\( k \\\\) influences the growth rate and behavior of the real part of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting both the amplitude and the integral's value over time. Changing \\\\( k \\\\) while maintaining \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) will modify the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and consequently the calculated value of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
