  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\) is calculated for the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any interventions, will the transformed function still maintain the characteristic frequency component \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) results in a function \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\\\), which explicitly contains the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the transformed domain, thereby preserving the characteristic frequency component of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
