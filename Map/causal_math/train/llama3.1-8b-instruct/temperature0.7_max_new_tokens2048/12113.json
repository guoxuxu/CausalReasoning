  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the impact of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z + T \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) is a real constant, over different scenarios.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), knowing the function but not the time T at which it was evaluated?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( L \\\\) adds an unknown constant T to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and the exponential \\\\( e^{i\\omega z} \\\\) masks this addition due to its periodic nature. Therefore, infinitely many values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could result in the same observed value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making it impossible to pinpoint \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
