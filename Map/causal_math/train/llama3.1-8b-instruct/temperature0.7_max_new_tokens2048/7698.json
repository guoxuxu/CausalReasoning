  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis based system where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = az^2 + bz \\\\), with constants a and b. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where c is a constant.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely deduce the initial function state \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) or its form at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the exponential growth factor and the function itself, complicating the extraction of the original function form at any specific time, especially at t = 0. The transformation masks the precise form and behavior of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) through cumulative integration, thus losing some original state information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
