  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by a complex function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed by another function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is some finite time.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to \\\\( z'(x) = z(x)e^{ux} \\\\) (where \\\\( u \\\\) is another real constant) during the interval [0, T], will the outcome of \\\\( h(z') \\\\) depend only on \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( u \\\\) or \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( e^{ux} \\\\) alters the function significantly. The new outcome \\\\( h(z') \\\\) will depend on the interplay between \\\\( w \\\\), \\\\( u \\\\), and \\\\( s \\\\) as each of these parameters interacts within both the modified function and the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
