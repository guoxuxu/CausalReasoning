  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, I is the current, and E(t) is a time-varying electromotive force. An analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of adding a linear filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) where C is a constant, initially at time t = 0.\n\nIf the filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) is applied to the current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( I_0 \\\\) was subjected directly to \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the filter modifies the initial current to \\\\( CI_0 \\\\), changing the trajectory of the system. The new initial condition impacts how the differential equation shapes the current's evolution over time, leading to a different \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
