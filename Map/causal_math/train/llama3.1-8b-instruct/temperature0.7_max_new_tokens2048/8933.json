  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nWill transforming \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) and then applying the system's Laplace transform result in the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\) as \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) has a Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t) e^{at}) \\\\) which by the properties of the Laplace transform, specifically the time shift theorem, equals \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\). Thus, the effect of this transformation and direct application of Laplace transform to the altered function results in \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\), maintaining the relationship of the transform across shifted domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
