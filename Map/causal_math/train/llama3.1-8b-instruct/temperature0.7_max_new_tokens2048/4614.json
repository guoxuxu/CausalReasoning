  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). We investigate how modifying the original function impacts its Laplace transform, and vice versa, particularly focusing on an exponential function applied as \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\), without knowing the specific transformation applied, can we accurately deduce and reconstruct \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the value of \\\\( a \\\\) or the nature of the transformation applied (whether \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at}f(t) \\\\) or similar), merely possessing \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is insufficient for uniquely determining \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Multiple values and forms of \\\\( a \\\\) and transformations could lead to the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
