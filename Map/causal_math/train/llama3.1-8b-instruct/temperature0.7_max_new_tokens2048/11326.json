  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves in the complex plane under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We study how the Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), affects our understanding of the system.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just by observing the transform's output?",
  "Explanation": "Since the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) is deterministic and linear, and the Fourier Transform is a linear operator, the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely determines the transform's output. Hence, one can deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
