  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents a control input. When a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx\\\\), with \\\\(Q\\\\) as a constant matrix, is applied, the dynamic response characteristics of the system are altered.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t = T, can the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) be determined without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx\\\\) was applied without record, predicting the exact original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) from \\\\(x(t)\\\\) becomes infeasible. The transformation could alter initial conditions in ways that are not distinguishable merely through observation at a later time, especially without specifics on the matrix \\\\(Q\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
