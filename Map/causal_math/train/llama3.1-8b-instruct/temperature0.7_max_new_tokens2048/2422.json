  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) \\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent control function.\n\nCan the original control function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely reconstructed from the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing the specific matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from a complex convolution operation involving matrices A and B, and without knowing these matrices, it is impossible to deconvolve the operation uniquely to retrieve \\\\( u(t) \\\\). Information about the system dynamics governed by A and B is essential for this inversion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
