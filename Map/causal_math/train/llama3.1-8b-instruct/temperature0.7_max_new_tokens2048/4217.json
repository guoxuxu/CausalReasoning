  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an input function \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) initially, and then \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the integral transformation, will the outcome at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) under the integral transformation without applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( x_0(s) \\\\) alters the initial input to \\\\( x_0(s) + c \\\\), hence modifying the integral to \\\\( \\\\int_{0}^{T} K(T, s) (x_0(s) + c) ds \\\\) which results in an additional constant term \\( c \\\\int_0^T K(T, s) ds \\) compared to the original outcome. This constant adds a shift to all values, affecting the output value at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
