  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nGiven the observed transformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to accurately identify whether only U was applied at t=0 and/or V was applied at T_1, just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used (U alone, V alone, both, or in sequence) from the function at T is not feasible as different combinations of U and V can yield similar transformations, particularly without knowledge of their specific matrix values and the precise times of application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
