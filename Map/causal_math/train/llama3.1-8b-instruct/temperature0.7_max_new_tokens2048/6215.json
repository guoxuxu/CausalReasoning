  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we examine the flow of an incompressible fluid using the Navier-Stokes equations in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The equations are given by \\\\(\\\\rho (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla \\\\mathbf{u}) = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\mu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\mathbf{f}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the fluid density, \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of manipulating the viscosity \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) as an external intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) the external force \\\\(\\\\mathbf{f}\\\\) is altered, will the velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the new force setting and be independent of the previous viscosity and force settings?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the external force at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new dynamic, but the resulting velocity field \\\\(\\\\mathbf{u}(T)\\\\) will still depend on the previous states influenced by both the original viscosity setting and the initial external force, besides the fluid's inherent properties and boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
