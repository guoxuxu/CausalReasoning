  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{(iBt)}z\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another real constant, on the behavior of the function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the function is evolved according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by a factor of \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\). Due to the different coefficients, the paths of evolution will differ, and hence \\\\( z(T) \\\\), when modified initially by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), will differ from direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) over the same period without transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
