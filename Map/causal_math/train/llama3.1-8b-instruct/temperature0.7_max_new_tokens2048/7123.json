  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega z}}{z^2 + a^2} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, in the context of complex function analysis. The scenario will analyze the impact when \\( z \\) is transformed by different contour integrations in the complex plane.\n\nIf at some point during the integral calculation, an intervention changes the path of integration to a deformable contour that avoids the poles, will the value of the integral depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the original path or \\( a \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the path of integration to one that does not enclose any poles renders the integral of \\( f(z) \\) to contribute zero due to Cauchy's integral theorem, independent of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( a \\). Hence, this intervention completely disregards the original path's characteristics and approaches zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
