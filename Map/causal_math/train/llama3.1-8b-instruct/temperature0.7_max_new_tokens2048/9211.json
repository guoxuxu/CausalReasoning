  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), generating a new function in the s-domain.\n\nAssuming an intervention using a Hilbert transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) in the s-domain, will the final state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be entirely independent of the original matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "While the Hilbert transform might manipulate the phase of the signal in the s-domain, the underlying dynamics dictated by A and B still influence the evolution of the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). Thus, the characteristics of matrices A and B continue to contribute to the final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
