  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nGiven the state \\( x(T) \\), can we precisely determine the interventions applied (whether \\( T(x) \\), application of \\( V \\), or both) just by examining \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( x(T) \\) could result from a variety of combinations of the matrices \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) due to the simplicity of the diagonal transformations and the absence of information about how \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) specifically scale the components of \\( x \\). Different combinations of \\( U \\) and \\( V \\) could yield similar or the same effects on \\( x(T) \\), making it impossible to uniquely ascertain the specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
