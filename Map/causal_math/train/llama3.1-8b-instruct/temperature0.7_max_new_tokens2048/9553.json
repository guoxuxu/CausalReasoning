  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). A boundary condition modification is introduced by the function \\\\(f(u) = u + k\\\\sin(u)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant, defined on the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the boundary condition at the start, will the solution \\\\( u(x) \\\\) inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) at time T strictly obey the original Laplace's equation without the modified boundary effect?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) alters the boundary conditions which in turn affects the solution inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). Since the boundary condition is part of the problem definition for Laplace's equation, changing it modifies the internal solution, thus the solution will not just depend on the original equation but also on the changed boundary condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
