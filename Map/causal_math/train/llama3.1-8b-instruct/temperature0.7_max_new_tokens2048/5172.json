  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyse the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were utilized (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), purely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and their integral transformations mean multiple possible combinations of interventions could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Identifying specifically which transformations were applied from the endpoint alone is not feasible due to non-unique potential paths.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
