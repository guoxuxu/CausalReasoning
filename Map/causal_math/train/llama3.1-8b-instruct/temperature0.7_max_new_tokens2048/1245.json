  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, and let \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) represent the potential at a point (x, y). The Fourier transformation is applied to \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\(U(k, y)\\\\) dependent on wavenumber k and y.\n\nIf an initial potential distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) is defined along the line \\\\(y = 0\\\\) and the system evolves according to the Laplace equation, will the Fourier transform of the evolved potential \\\\(U(k, y)\\\\) at y = Y be the same as directly computing the Fourier transform of \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the potential distribution under the Laplace equation maintains harmonic properties, and any changes retain linearity. Thus, transforming after evolution retains the same characteristics as transforming initially, thanks to the linearity of both the Laplace equation and the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
