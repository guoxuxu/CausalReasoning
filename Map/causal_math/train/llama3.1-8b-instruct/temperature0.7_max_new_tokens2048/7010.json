  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across a capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{C}I\\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and I is current. Evaluate the impact of a sudden change in current input described by a Heaviside step function \\\\( I(t) = I_0u(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( I_0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the voltage V(t) at t = T, can we infer the value of \\\\( I_0 \\\\) without knowing the resistance R and capacitance C?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the resistance R and capacitance C is crucial to accurately deduce \\\\( I_0 \\\\) from the voltage. The voltage response depends on both parameters, and without them, it's impossible to isolate the effect of \\\\( I_0 \\\\) on the voltage.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
