  "Problem": "Investigate a complex dynamical system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the input \\( x(t) \\) according to a Laplace transform relationship \\( Z(s) = X(s)/s \\). Here, \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) respectively, with \\( s \\) being a complex variable.\n\nKnowing \\( z(t) = 1 - e^{-t} \\) at t = T, can we infer that the input was \\( x(t) = e^{-t} \\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "While the specific output \\( z(t) = 1 - e^{-t} \\) fits the model for \\( x(t) = e^{-t} \\), multiple causal inputs could potentially yield the same \\( z(t) \\) due to properties of the Laplace transform and its linearity; additional data or constraints on \\( X(s) \\) are necessary to definitively point to \\\\( x(t) = e^{-t} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
