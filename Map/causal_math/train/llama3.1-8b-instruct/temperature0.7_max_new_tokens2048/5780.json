  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t, z) dt \\\\), where \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is a function of both the real variable t and the complex variable z. This transformation maps complex functions into other complex functions using an integral transform influenced by the parameter s.\n\nCan the original form of \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) or the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) be accurately deduced from observing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) post-intervention, without knowing the specific details of the intervention \\\\( h(t, z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the intervention \\\\( h(t, z) \\\\), it is inherently difficult to reverse-engineer the original \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) or to accurately determine \\\\( s \\\\). The modifications brought about by \\\\( h \\\\) may mask or mimic original features of \\\\( g \\\\) and the effects of \\\\( s \\\\) in the integrated result, resulting in multiple feasible candidates for both \\\\( g \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) that could have produced the observed \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
