  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is transformed through a Laplace Transform to produce \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The system is defined by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the circuit's response is calculated using the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot V(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output voltage \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) from a transformed input, could you definitively identify the form of the original input \\\\( V(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific transformation applied in \\\\( V(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transformation \\\\( V(s) \\\\) applied to the input, it's not possible to accurately determine the original \\\\( V(t) \\\\) just from observing \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\), as various transformations could yield similar outputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
