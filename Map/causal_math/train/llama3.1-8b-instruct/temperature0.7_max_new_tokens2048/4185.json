  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nIf the matrix S is transformed to multiply all eigenvalues by a scalar \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) without other interventions, does this scalar multiplication change the overall transformation properties of the initial input x to the output z?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying all eigenvalues by a scalar \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) effectively scales the transformation matrix S. This changes the linear transformation carried out by S, thus changing the output z for any given input x.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
