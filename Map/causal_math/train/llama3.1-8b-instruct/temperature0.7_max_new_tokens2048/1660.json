  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct}z dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials, the varied integral transformations can result in the same endpoint through multiple potential paths and interventions. This complexity prevents a clear identification of specific interventions solely based on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
