  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. The function describes the combined influence of two transformations on initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention with new vectors \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) is applied, replacing \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), will the state at \\\\( T \\\\) be solely dependent on the values of \\\\( u \\\\), \\\\( v \\\\), and initial matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the intervention replaces the initial vectors with \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\), the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any time after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is uniquely determined by how these new vectors evolve under the influence of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), specifically through \\\\( e^{AT}u \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}v \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
