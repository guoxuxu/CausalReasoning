  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector space given by the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) which projects vectors onto a subspace. We explore the effects of applying another linear transformation \\\\( Q \\\\), which is a rotation matrix, on this vector space.\n\nKnowing the final vector \\\\( v(T) \\\\) after interventions (projection, rotation, and scaling), can we unambiguously determine the sequence and types of these transformations, assuming no knowledge of the vector's initial state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the different potential transformation paths and non-commutative effects between \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( S \\\\), multiple transformation sequences might yield the same final vector state. Without initial state or explicit transformation sequence, it's impossible to deduce the exact procedures or their order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
