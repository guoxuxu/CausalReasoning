  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\). The system is initially defined by the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). An external operation applies the transformation function \\\\( g(t) = t^3 \\\\) at some time t = 0.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( L(m)(s) \\\\) at a certain s after interventions were applied, can we specify which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( L(m)(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace transform of \\\\( m(t) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate the sequence or specific transformations applied. Multiple combinations of transformations could potentially lead to the same or indistinguishable results in the Laplace domain, leading to ambiguity in determining the exact interventions and their order.\"    ",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
