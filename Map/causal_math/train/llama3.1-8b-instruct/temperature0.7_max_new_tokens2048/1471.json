  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a series of transformations including a Fourier Transform followed by a linear filter represented by a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then an inverse Fourier Transform.\n\nIf an additional non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) is applied to the signal after the inverse Fourier Transform, will the final output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be fully characterized by the linear filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the non-linear distortion \\\\( D(t) \\\\) significantly alters the final output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), meaning it cannot be characterized solely by the linear properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The non-linearity introduced by \\\\( D(t) \\\\) adds additional effects that are not represented by the linear transformation alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
