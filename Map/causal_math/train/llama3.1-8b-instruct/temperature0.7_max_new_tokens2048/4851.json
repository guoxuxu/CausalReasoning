  "Problem": "Analyze a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied on an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) within a linear system governed by \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\). The concern here is how transformations and external interventions affect the evolution of the system over time.\n\nConsider an intervention with another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\\\) at time t = t_1. Will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the original dynamics \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\) and not on the initial application of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the evolution path by changing the system's phase and frequency starting from t_1, thereby making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend on both the initial application of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{i\\theta t} \\\\), as well as the intrinsic system dynamics \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
