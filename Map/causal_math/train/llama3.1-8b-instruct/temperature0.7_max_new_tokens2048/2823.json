  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nIf another function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z + c} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention after transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and before evaluating \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the final result of \\\\( g(f(h(z_0))) \\\\) rely only on the original transformation h?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the intervention \\\\( f(z) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, resulting in the composition of operations that significantly alter the input to \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Each transformation (scaling, rotation, translation) contributed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\) influences the final output, making the result dependent not only on h but also on f.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
