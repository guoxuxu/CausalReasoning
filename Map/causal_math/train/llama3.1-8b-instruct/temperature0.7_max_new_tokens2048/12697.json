  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with a function transformation defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x t^kf(t) dt \\\\) where k is a constant and f is a differentiable function. The impact of the linear operation transformation \\\\( L[z(x)] = \\int_0^x z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, x].\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) over the interval [0, x], can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without prior information about its form?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( L[z(x)] \\\\) is not feasible due to loss of information during integration. Integral transformations accumulate values resulting in a potential overlap in outcomes from different functions, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional conditions or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
