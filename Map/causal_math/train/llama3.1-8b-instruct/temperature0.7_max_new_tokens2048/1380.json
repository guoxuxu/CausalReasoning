  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation matrix T, where \\\\( Tx = y \\\\) changes the basis of the solution and subsequently applying the inverse transformation \\\\( T^{-1}y = x \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x \\\\) at the endpoint of the process, can we determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or neither), strictly from knowing \\\\( x \\\\) satisfies \\\\( Ax = b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final condition \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) might be satisfied through different pathways (applying \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), both, or neither). Multiple combinations of transformations could lead to the same final mathematical validity, making it impossible to uniquely identify the paths from the outcome alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
