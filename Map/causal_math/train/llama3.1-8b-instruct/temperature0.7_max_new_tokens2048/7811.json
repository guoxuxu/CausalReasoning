  "Problem": "In the context of control theory, consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the state-space equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is the input matrix. We examine how the integral transformation defined by \\\\( x_{new}(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) impacts the system's behavior with respect to input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a control intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\), such as resetting or altering it, will the resulting state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 strictly rely on the altered \\\\( u(t) \\\\) post-intervention and not on any previous state or input history?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the initial condition dependency of the integral transformation, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) relies on the entire history of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the state at intervention time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Altering \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) does not erase the influence of prior inputs due to the system memory defined by the matrix A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
