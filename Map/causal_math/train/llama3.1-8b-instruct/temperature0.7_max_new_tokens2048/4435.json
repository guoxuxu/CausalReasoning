  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Evaluate the change in the function through an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different complex number.\n\nIf an intervention is implemented at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying \\\\( a \\\\) to a new value \\\\( c \\\\), will the transformed endpoint \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) entirely represent the effects of the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), particularly how it interacts with the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The resulting \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) is affected by the interplay of \\\\( a, b, \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), hence the original parameters cannot solely describe the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
