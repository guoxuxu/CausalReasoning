  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit represented by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the frequency complex variable, and circuit behavior is regulated by this impedance function. The circuit undergoes a Fourier transformation which impacts the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan the original impedance function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be uniquely determined after observing the response \\\\( R(t) \\\\) for some duration T without any further information about the original signal or interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and bijective nature of the Fourier transformation in LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) systems, and the use of an impulse signal, the original impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) can be precisely determined by the Fourier transform of the observed response \\\\( R(t) \\\\), under the assumption that no external intervention has altered the signal or the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
