  "Problem": "Assume there is a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex numbers. This function is applied iteratively in the context of complex dynamics, commonly used in generating Julia sets.\n\nIf, during the iteration process at some step \\\\( n \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z_n \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants), will the final pattern of the sequence be independent of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory of the sequence. Depending on the values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), this can significantly alter the final outcomes, potentially escaping to infinity or converging differently compared to the non-intervened sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
