  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) over time is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be determined from the output \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\) after an unknown intervention changed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to some \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} \\\\), knowing only \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the transform output \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z')(s) \\\\) alone, it is impossible to deduce the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) because the intervention fundamentally alters the function to \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), and the transformation output reflects only the properties of the modified system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
