  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), with a constant complex number \\\\( s \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation modifies the initial conditions and the evolution path by accumulating complex exponential weighted integrals of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which fundamentally alters \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, making the final state at t = T differ from untransformed evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
