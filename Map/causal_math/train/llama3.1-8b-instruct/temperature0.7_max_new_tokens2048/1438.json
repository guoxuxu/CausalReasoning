  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and z is a complex-valued function of time t. Investigate the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is another real constant, on the evolution of z.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) scales the initial condition, without knowing whether or not the transformation was applied, it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The absence or presence of the transformation fundamentally changes the initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
