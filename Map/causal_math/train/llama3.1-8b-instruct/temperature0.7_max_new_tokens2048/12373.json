  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\\\) over a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u = f \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). We examine the result of initial transformations using the eigenfunction expansions of \\\\( u \\\\) and how tool-based interventions like Laplacian solvers act.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at some point within \\\\( D \\\\), can we accurately identify if the Fourier transform was applied to \\\\( f \\\\) before it was used as a boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the initial form of \\\\( f \\\\) or the direct observation of boundary conditions, the resultant field \\\\( u \\\\) inside \\\\( D \\\\) does not uniquely specify whether \\\\( f \\\\) was Fourier transformed due to the potential similarity in solutions stemming from variably transformed boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
