  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nKnowing the integral result of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\) and that an unspecified intervention (path alteration) occurred, can we determine the nature and effect of this intervention precisely?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact nature of the path alteration or any specific interventions requires more information than the integral result of an analytic function. Since the path integral for such functions is independent of path in a simply connected region, it is not possible to deduce the intervention specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
