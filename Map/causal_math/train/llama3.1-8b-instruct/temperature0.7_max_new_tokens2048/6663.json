  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) that is subjected to an integral transformation defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable. This transformation transforms the function from the time domain to the frequency domain. We explore how manipulating the function directly or its transform can affect causal inference.\n\nIf, at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a manipulation in the form of multiplying by another exponential term \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) (b being another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant transformed function \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) for s correspond only to the initial transformation up to an overall shift?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the time-domain function which already includes the modification due to \\\\( e^{at} \\\\). The final form of the transform \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) would embody a compounding of shifts, still representable as a shifted version of the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), but now shifted by \\\\( s-(a+b) \\\\), showing compounded effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
