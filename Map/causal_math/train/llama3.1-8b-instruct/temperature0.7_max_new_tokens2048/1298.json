  "Problem": "We investigate a system governed by a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) represents a matrix with complex entries and \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) is a vector in the complex plane. The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) with a constant matrix \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) is then applied to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial vector \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = 0 \\\\\\) after observing \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\), without knowing whether \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "With no information about the application of \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\), it is complicated to trace back to \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) accurately. The function \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) might alter \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) in a way that the changes induced by \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) could mask or modify the effects of \\\\\\( A \\\\\\), making the original state non-deductible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
