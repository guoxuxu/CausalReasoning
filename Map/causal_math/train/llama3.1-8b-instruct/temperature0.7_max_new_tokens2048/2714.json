  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane by \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\). We analyze transformations applied to this function through the linear operator \\\\( L[f(z)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( L[f(z)] \\\\) for some value of s, can we deterministically revert or compute back to obtain the original form \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) without information about the original function form used?",
  "Explanation": "If the Laplace transform result given is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\), one can uniquely infer using the inverse Laplace transform that the original function was \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\), since this is a well-known transform pair and no other basic function shares this transform for Re(s) > 1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
