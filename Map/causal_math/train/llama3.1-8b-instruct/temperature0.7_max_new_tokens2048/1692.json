  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nConsidering the final observed output \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\), can we precisely determine both the original exponential decay rate \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and the parameters of \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\) solely based on the output data at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to superposition and interaction effects in the Fourier transform and additional modifications by \\\\( h(f) \\\\), it is not feasible to uniquely identify and separate both \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) values just by observing the output spectrum at T. This ambiguity harps on the overlapping influences each parameter has on the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
