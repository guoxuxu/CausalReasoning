  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( dz/dt = Hz \\\\), where H is a Hermitian matrix. An intervention is applied to the system using a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), with K being a skew-Hermitian matrix.\n\nIf an intervention using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iLt}z \\\\) (where L is another skew-Hermitian matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the operator H?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iLt}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on all three matrices H, K, and L, due to their potential non-commutativity, affecting how transformations propagate through time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
