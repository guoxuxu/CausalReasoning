  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over complex numbers \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its transformation with a complex integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\tau z(\\\\tau)} d\\\\tau\\\\). We are interested in the behavior of this transformation over time and how interventions might alter this behavior.\n\nGiven the state of the transformed function at t = T, can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based on the knowledge of the resultant function alone?",
  "Explanation": "Deciphering which transformations were applied to reach a particular state at t = T is highly complex due to the nature of both integral and functional transformations influencing the trajectory in overlapping ways. The complexity of back-calculating the precise interventions from the resultant function is impractical without additional context or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
