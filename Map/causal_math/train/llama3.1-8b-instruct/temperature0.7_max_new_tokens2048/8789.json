  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's output. Suppose an external operator transforms the function using a unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( g(t) = f(t) u(t-a) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( f(t) u(t-a) \\\\) and then transformed by Laplace without further modifications, will \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\) equal \\\\( L[f(t)] \\\\) shifted by a factor related to \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by the unit step function \\\\( u(t-a) \\\\) introduces a shift in the function, represented by a factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) in the Laplace domain. Thus, \\\\( L[g(t)] = e^{-as} L[f(t)] \\\\), showing that the effect on \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\) is a shift related to \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
