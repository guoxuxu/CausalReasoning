  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) represented as a matrix on a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) under the flow given by \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a square matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = L\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\), and we are interested in evaluating how this affects the system dynamics.\n\nGiven the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we accurately determine which interventions (whether \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) were applied and at which instances, based solely on the value of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "There might be several different pathways involving different orders, combinations, or timings of interventions with \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) that result in the same observational endpoint at \\\\( t = T \\\\). The non-commutativity of matrix operations and overlap in potential solutions prevent pinpointing the exact sequence of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
