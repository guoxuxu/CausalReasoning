  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function over time domain t.\n\nAfter applying the Laplace transform and observing the s-domain function, can we deduce the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any prior knowledge about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transformed function in the s-domain clearly indicates the original frequency as the imaginary part of the pole. Since the pole is at \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\), we can directly infer \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
