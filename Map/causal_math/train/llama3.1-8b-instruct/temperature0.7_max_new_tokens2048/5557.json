  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the state of a system z(t) is transformed by a complex function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-iB)s} z(s) ds \\\\), where A and B are matrices, and i is the imaginary unit. This system's behavior under temporal evolution is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) until time T, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be identical to the scenario where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was just evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) for the same time period?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition through integration involving both A and B. This initial modification, which introduces complex exponential dynamics, changes the trajectory of the system, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different compared with straightforward evolution under C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
