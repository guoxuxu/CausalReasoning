  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation using a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). This transformed signal is then filtered through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), impacting the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the end signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we accurately determine what transformations were applied (e.g., Fourier or Laplace) and whether there were interventions, solely by observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple arrangements of transformations and interventions might lead to the same output signal due to the overlapping effects and potential equivalences between different transformational impacts on the spectrum. Therefore, it's unclear purely from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) what specific procedures or sequences were applied during processing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
