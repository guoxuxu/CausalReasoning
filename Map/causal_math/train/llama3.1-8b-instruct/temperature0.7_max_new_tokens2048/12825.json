  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) obtained at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether any transformations acted on it through matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) potentially alters \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a complex exponential manner that is dependent on A. Without knowing A, the reverse transformation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely or accurately determined, as the effects induced by A are unknown or untraceable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
