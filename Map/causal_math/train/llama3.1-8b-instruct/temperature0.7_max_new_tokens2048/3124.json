  "Problem": "Let's consider the probability density function \\( p(z) \\) that describes the distribution of a random variable \\( Z \\) undergoing the Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{p}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(z)e^{-i\\omega z} dz \\). We investigate how transformations in the time domain and frequency domain affect this PDF.\n\nKnowing \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\), can we determine exactly whether the original function \\( p(z) \\) was used, or modified by an exponential, solely based on the value of \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Fourier Transform \\( \\hat{r}(\\omega) \\) represents the combined effects of \\( p(z) \\) and the exponential \\( e^z \\). Without additional contextual or base-line information about \\( p(z) \\) and \\( e^z \\), it can be challenging to separately identify or confirm with certainty whether \\( p(z) \\) alone or its modification was utilized, due to the linear and additive nature of the Fourier Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
