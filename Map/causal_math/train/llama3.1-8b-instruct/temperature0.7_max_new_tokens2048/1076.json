  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( U(k) \\\\) at later time T, can we determine whether the constant \\\\( k \\\\) was changed at some point during the evolution, only based on \\\\( U(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though the Fourier transform carries significant information about \\\\( u(x) \\\\), the exact history of parameter changes such as modifications of \\\\( k \\\\) is not decodable from \\\\( U(k) \\\\) alone without additional contextual data about times and nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
