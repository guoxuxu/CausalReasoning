  "Problem": "We postulate a scenario involving the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t) \\) and its effect when used in conjunction with an integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform, applied to a function \\( h(t) \\) that represents a physical system's response.\n\nIf an intervention via convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) happens after \\( h(t) \\) is convoluted with \\( \\delta(t) \\) but before the application of the Laplace Transform, does the resulting transform solely represent the effect of \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\( g(t) \\) as an intervention changes the combined function to \\( g(t) * h(t) \\) where * denotes convolution. Consequently, the Laplace Transform will represent this new convoluted function and not merely the effect of \\( h(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
