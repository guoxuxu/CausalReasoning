  "Problem": "Consider a two-variable system described by the equations \\\\(x' = x + 2y\\\\) and \\\\(y' = -2x + y\\\\). We explore the system's behavior under linear transformations and their combinations, denoted by matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(t) & -\\\\sin(t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(t) & \\\\cos(t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\), which rotates the state vector \\\\((x, y)\\\\).\n\nIf a state vector \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) is initialized at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and transformed by \\\\(M(t)\\\\) before evolving, will the state \\\\((x(t), y(t))\\\\) be the same at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) as a vector that is simply evolved without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The rotation transformation \\\\(M(t)\\\\) alters the initial condition by changing the direction and position of the vector. The effect of the transformation modifies how the system evolves, even though the underlying dynamics (described by the derivatives) remain the same. The transformed initial conditions result in a different trajectory than if the vector was just evolved under the differential equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
