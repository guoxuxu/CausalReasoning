  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Suppose the inverse transform \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time and it's subjected to various operations like multiplication by an exponential function or convolution.\n\nObserving an inverse Laplace transform \\\\( f(t-2) \\\\), can we conclude that the function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was multiplied by \\\\( e^{-2s} \\\\) to cause the observed time shift in \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of a time-shifted inverse transform \\\\( f(t-2) \\\\) implies a multiplication by \\\\( e^{-2s} \\\\) in the Laplace transform domain. This directly follows from the time-shifting property in the Laplace transform, making it possible to infer the specific modification in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
