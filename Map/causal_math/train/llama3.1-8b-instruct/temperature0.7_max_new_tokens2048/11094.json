  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a linear time-invariant system where the complex impedance (Z) of the circuit is formulated as \\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\), and s is the Laplace transform variable. We explore the effects of adding a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\\\frac{1}{sC} \\) to this system.\n\nAfter observing the system's response with the capacitor, is it possible to mathematically recover the original system's impedance \\( Z(s) \\) accurately without knowing the value of C?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the capacitor value C, the new poles introduced by the parallel capacitor remain unknown, which prevents accurate determination of the original system's characteristics solely from the altered response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
