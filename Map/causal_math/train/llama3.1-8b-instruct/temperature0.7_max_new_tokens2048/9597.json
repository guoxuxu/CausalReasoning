  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied on a complex plane and then \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is implemented, will the output necessarily be the same regardless of the variations within the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) can change based on how the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) behaves across different parts of the complex plane. The integral transformation \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is sensitive to changes in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to variations in \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\) across the domain of integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
