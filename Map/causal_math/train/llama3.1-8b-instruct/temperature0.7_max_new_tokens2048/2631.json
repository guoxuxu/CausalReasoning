  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit in which the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) over time t is driven by a complex function of voltage \\\\( V(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the radian frequency. We explore how applying a Laplace transform to the voltage affects the current's behavior and the system's response.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) a filter is applied that modifies \\\\( V(t) \\\\) to \\\\( V'(t)=V(t)e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a damping coefficient, will the resultant transformed current \\\\( \\hat{I}'(s) \\\\) reflect only the properties of the filter applied and not the original \\\\( V(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter changes the voltage input but the resultant current in the Laplace domain, \\\\( \\hat{I}'(s) \\\\), not only reflects the properties of the filter but also integrates the effects of the original voltage. Both \\\\( V(t) \\\\) and the filter's influence are represented in \\\\( \\hat{I}'(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
