  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(u) = e^{Mt}u\\\\), where M is another linear differential operator, on the evolution of function u over time t.\n\nIf at any time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(s(u) = e^{Nt}u\\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, does the end state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(s(u)\\\\), changes the system's trajectory again, making the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) dependent on M, N, and L. Each operator potentially alters the function's evolution, leading to a final state influenced by multiple factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
