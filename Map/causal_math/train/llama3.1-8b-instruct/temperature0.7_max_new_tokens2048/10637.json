  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex system where the temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The system undergoes an intervention where for \\( t \\geq t_0 \\), an external source \\( S(x,t) = A e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) (where \\( A \\) and \\( \\\\omega \\) are constants) heats the system.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x,0) = T_0(x) \\) is given and allowed to evolve under the heat equation without external source, will the temperature at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) strictly follow the natural diffusion process?",
  "Explanation": "Without the external heating source \\( S(x,t) \\), the temperature evolution only depends on the initial conditions \\( T_0(x) \\) and the natural diffusion process described by the heat equation. The system evolves only due to its original state and thermal properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
