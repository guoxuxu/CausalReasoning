  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we exactly determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identical endpoints \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from differing sequences of interventions due to the complex, non-commutative interactions between matrix exponentials. The transformations \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) create overlapping potential states, obscuring the original interventions employed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
