  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( T \\\\) applied to the initial conditions over time.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed by matrix \\\\( T \\\\) to become \\\\( T x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by T alters the initial conditions. The new initial state \\\\( T x_0 \\\\) evolves differently unless T commutes with \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), the matrix exponential of M times t. Generally, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will differ unless T and M have specific relations such as commutativity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
