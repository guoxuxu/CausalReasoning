  "Problem": "Let us consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) represents a control input vector. The Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) applied to this system results in \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\) where \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\nCan the specific interventions applied (such as changes in \\( A \\) or \\( B \\), and changes in control inputs from \\( u_0 \\) to \\( \\tilde{u} \\)) be precisely identified from knowledge of \\( X(s) \\) alone at various \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\) represents a convolution of system responses making it challenging to disaggregate and identify specific interventions directly. Multiple combinations of changes in matrices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and control vectors could lead to the same \\( X(s) \\), especially without exact knowledge of when changes occur or their specific nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
