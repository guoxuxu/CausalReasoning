  "Problem": "Assume a system of linear equations modeled by the matrix equation \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a constant vector. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have significantly altered the trajectory and final conditions, which an unaltered system \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) would not predict.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
