  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), which transforms a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into its Laplace Transform domain representative \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Suppose an original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A is a scalar, and its behavior under perturbation represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Bt}f(t) \\\\), where B is also a scalar.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at the start without knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( B \\\\), the exact form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be deduced from \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The transformation involves a decay factor \\\\( e^{-Bt} \\\\), fundamentally altering the temporal characteristics and decoupling them from the original \\\\( A \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
