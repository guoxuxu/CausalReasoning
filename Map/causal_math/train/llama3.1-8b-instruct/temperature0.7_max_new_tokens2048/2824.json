  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nCan we determine only from the output of \\\\( g(f(h(z_0))) \\\\) what specific transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the exponential nature of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( f(z) \\\\) compounded by the linear transformation in \\\\( h(z) \\\\), multiple sets of parameters and transformations can lead to the same final output. The overlaps in complex function behavior under exponential and linear transformations result in indistinguishability regarding the specific path of transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
