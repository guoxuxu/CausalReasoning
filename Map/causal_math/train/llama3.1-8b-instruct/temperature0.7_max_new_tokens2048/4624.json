  "Problem": "Consider an integral transform scenario where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} x(s) ds \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and y is a constant vector, is applied to the system, and we are interested in understanding its effects at time T.\n\nIs it possible to determine both the initial setup (B, y) and the changes made at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) (C, w) by observing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and overlapping effects of multiple exponential transformations integrated over time contribute to a scenario where multiple combinations of B, y, C, w might yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, it’s not possible to uniquely differentiate all initial and intervening factors from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
