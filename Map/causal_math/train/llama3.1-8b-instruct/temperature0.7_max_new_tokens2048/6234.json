  "Problem": "Consider a control system in which an input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the change induced by a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) where C and D are also constant matrices.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T without information on whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the transformation introduced by \\\\( Ce^{Dt} \\\\) can mask the original state, making it impossible to reconstruct \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely due to modifications that cannot be reversed simply based on observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
