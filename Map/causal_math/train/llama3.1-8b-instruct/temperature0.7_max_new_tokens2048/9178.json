  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. The function defines a rotation in the complex plane. We study the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Bz \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) and knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied is non-trivial because knowing only \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}Bx \\\\) without information about B or x, does not allow us to uniquely backtrack to verify the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to potential scalar equivalences in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
