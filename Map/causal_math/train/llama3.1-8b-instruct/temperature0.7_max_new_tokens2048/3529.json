  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the role of the integral transform \\\\( H(u) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sL}u(s) ds \\\\) applied to the function u over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( H(u) \\\\) is computed from the initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time T be different from direct evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Computing \\\\( H(u) \\\\) involves integrating the influence of the operator e^{-sL} applied at different time points, which fundamentally alters the influence paths and thus the final state \\\\( u(t) \\\\). This distinction means the behavior and endpoint of \\\\( u \\\\) will diverge from the trajectory it would have without computing \\\\( H(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
