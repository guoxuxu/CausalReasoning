  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) satisfying \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions were employed (whether \\\\(f(x)\\\\), \\\\(g(x)\\\\), or both), based only on the knowledge of \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are invertible transformations and any of their applications or combinations will lead to a solution of \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely ascertain the sequence or types of interventions from the endpoint alone, due to the solutions' invariance under these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
