  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of the integral transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\\\) on the function \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\\\( f(t) \\\\\\) from \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) after transformation by \\\\\\( T \\\\\\), knowing the type of \\\\\\( f(t) \\\\\\) (sine function), without additional information on \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though we know \\\\\\( f(t) \\\\\\) is a sine function, the exact frequency parameter \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) cannot be determined solely from \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) unless we have specific values or additional constraints on \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\). Multiple \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) values can satisfy given \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) values depending on the configuration of \\\\\\( s^2 + \\\\omega^2 \\\\\\) in the denominator.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
