  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\) with A and B being constant complex matrices. This scenario explores the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) under the linear transformations \\\\( T_x(x, y) = (x+1, y) \\\\) and \\\\( T_y(x, y) = (x, y+1) \\\\).\n\nIf the transformations \\\\( T_x \\\\) and \\\\( T_y \\\\) are applied to the variables \\(x, y\\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( z \\) evolves according to \\( f(x, y) \\) without further interventions, will the value of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( (x, y) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( f(x, y) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T_x \\) and \\( T_y \\) changes the arguments of \\( f \\) linearly, altering the exponential map. Since \\( e^{A(x+1) + B(y+1)} \\) differs from \\( e^{Ax + By} \\) by factors of \\( e^A \\) and \\( e^B \\), the trajectory and hence the value of \\( z(t) \\) will be different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
