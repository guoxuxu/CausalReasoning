  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing dynamic states of a system, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. A transformation defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a complex constant matrix is introduced.\n\nAt time T, observing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined precisely what transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, knowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to overlapping effects and the non-commutative nature of the transformations involving complex matrix exponentials, different combinations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could lead to the same end state. This ambiguity makes it impossible to conclusively identify which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → x; A → y; B → y; C → z; f(z) → z; g(z) is not a transformation in this scenario, so it's excluded; x → z; y → z; z → z(T)"
