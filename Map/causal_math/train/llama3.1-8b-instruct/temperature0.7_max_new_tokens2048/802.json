  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) that describes heat diffusion in a rod. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{w x} \\\\), where w is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature profile \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied, the added term \\\\( e^{w x} \\\\) complicates retroactively determining the original profile \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The influence of the exponential term on the heat diffusion needs to be known to accurately reconstruct \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
