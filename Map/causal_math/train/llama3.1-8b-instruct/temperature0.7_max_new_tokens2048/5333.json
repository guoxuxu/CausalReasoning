  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nWhen a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and then evolved according to the transformed partial differential equation, will the transformed solution at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) reveal the same dynamics as if \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was directly solved without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform linearly transforms the differential equation into the frequency domain preserving the dynamics of the system. By solving the transformed equation and applying the inverse Fourier transform, the dynamics at each frequency are accurately captured, reflecting the underlying behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
