  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving an electrical network with a linear resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit. The circuit's voltage response \\( v(t) \\) across the capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{1}{RC}v = \\frac{1}{RC}v_{\\text{in}} \\), where \\( v_{\\text{in}} \\) is the input voltage source and R and C are the resistance and capacitance, respectively. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\} \\) to convert the system into the s-domain making analysis potentially different.\n\nIf an external resistive force described by a new resistance \\( R_2 \\) is inserted at time \\( t_1 \\) affecting \\( v_{\\text{in}} \\), will the endpoint \\( v(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original \\( R \\) and not on \\( R_2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( R_2 \\) alters the system dynamics. While \\( R \\) sets the initial response characteristics of the circuit, \\( R_2 \\) changes the input voltage \\( v_{\\text{in}} \\) relationships, thereby affecting the circuit’s entire voltage response post-\\( t_1 \\). The new equilibrium and dynamics depend on both \\( R \\) and \\( R_2 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
