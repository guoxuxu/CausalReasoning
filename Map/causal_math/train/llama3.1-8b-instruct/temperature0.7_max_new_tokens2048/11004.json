  "Problem": "Consider a frequency analysis where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The signal is then processed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), leading to an output signal represented by the product \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nFrom observing the final output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), is it possible to determine definitively whether the intervention (the filter \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)) was applied, and what the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) is a convolution of multiple transformations (initial conditions by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and the intervention by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\)). This convolution masks the clarity required to distinctly identify whether the intervention occurred and what the characteristics of the original input were. Without explicit knowledge of the transformations and the initial signal characteristics, the reconstruction and verification of both the intervention and original signal are ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
