  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The function undergoes a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively identify which interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, solely from the state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied cannot be conclusively determined from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone. The impact of non-commutative matrix exponentials over C and D, and overlapping effects of these transformations, provide several pathways that could result in the same final state, ambiguating precise intervention identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
