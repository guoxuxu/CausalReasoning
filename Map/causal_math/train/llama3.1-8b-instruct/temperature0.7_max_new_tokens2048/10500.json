  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) governed by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{iBt} \\\\), where B is another real number, applied at time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the output at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compound effect of the transformations and the original evolution path can lead to identical or indistinguishable outputs under different sequences or types of interventions. Confounding effects due to different parameter values (A, B, C) and their nonlinear interaction in complex plane rotations complicate the back-calculation of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
