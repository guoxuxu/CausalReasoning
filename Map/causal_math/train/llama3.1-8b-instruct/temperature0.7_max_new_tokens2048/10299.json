  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) is introduced as an intentional change at some point during the integration over \\\\( w(C) \\\\), will the resultant integral value depend solely on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( w(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The sequence and nature of such transformations will affect the path and potentially introduce new elements or exclude others affecting the overall integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
