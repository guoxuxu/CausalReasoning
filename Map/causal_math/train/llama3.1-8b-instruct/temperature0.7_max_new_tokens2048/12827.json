  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to conclusively identify which transformations (original or during intervention) were applied just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nontrivial interaction between exponential transformations affected by different matrices (A, B, C) and their potential non-commutativity, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely specify which transformations were applied or their parameters. Multiple transformation sequences could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), obscuring the effects of individual transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
