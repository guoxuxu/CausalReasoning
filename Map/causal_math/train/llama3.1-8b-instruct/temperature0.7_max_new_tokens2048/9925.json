  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any additional modifications, will the outcome \\\\(T[z(t)]\\\\) solely be dependent on the initial function form initiated by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) results in \\\\(\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-(s-i\\\\omega)t} dt\\\\), which simplifies directly to \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega}\\\\). The outcome is dependent only on the parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(s\\\\) starting from the original form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any external modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
