  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution along a rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial heat distribution function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and a later heat source intervention represented by \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which heat source interventions were used, if any, by knowing just the temperature at time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diffusive nature of heat and potential overlapping effects of various heat source interventions, it is challenging to conclusively identify which specific interventions were applied solely based on the end temperature distribution. Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions could lead to similar distributions at a later time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
