  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the waveform at time \\\\( T \\\\) still reflect only the original harmonic motion influenced by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, modifying the waveform further to triple the original frequency starting from \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which makes the resulting state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on the initial angular frequency and effects of both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\). This results in an evolution completely different from the natural harmonic motion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
