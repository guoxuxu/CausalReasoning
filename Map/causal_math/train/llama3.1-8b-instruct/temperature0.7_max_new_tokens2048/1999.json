  "Problem": "Analyze a hypothetical economic model where output \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) is described by \\\\( Q(t) = Ce^{kt} \\\\), where C is output at t=0, and k is a growth rate constant. The intervention is defined by a policy function \\\\( P(Q) = Qe^{rt} \\\\), with r being a policy-induced growth adjustment factor.\n\nIf a policy intervention \\\\( P(Q) \\\\) is applied part way through the time period, say at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on the original growth rate k, and not on r?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the growth rate from k to a compounded rate involving both k and r. Hence, the final output is a result of both the inherent growth rate and the intervention-induced adjustment, affecting the output trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
