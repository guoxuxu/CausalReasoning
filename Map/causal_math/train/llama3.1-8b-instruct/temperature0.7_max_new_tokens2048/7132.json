  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on a vector space, where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, analyze how the Fourier transform affects the signal when represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-2\\\\pi ist}x(t) dt \\\\). We examine the transformation sequences and their reversibility in different intervention scenarios.\n\nGiven the outcome frequency spectrum \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can the sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both were applied) be fully retraced given only the final \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final frequency spectrum \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can potentially result from various combinations of matrix applications and ordering on \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Without additional information on the sequence or type of transformations, the inverse process cannot be uniquely determined, as multiple transformation sequences could yield the same \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
