  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally without intervention, and then a Laplace transform is applied, will the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) accurately represent the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform inherently captures the frequency components of the signal through its transformation mechanism. Therefore, by analyzing \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), the constant frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original function is clearly represented and can be accurately determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
