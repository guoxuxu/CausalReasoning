  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a(x) \\\\) is a spatially varying coefficient. The impact of the initial transformation by Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}[u(x,0)](s) \\\\) is studied over time t.\n\nIf an intervention by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t_1)](\\\\xi) \\\\) (where t_1 < T) is applied, will the endpoint u(x,T) for T > t_1 be independent of the intervention's effects?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform applied as an intervention alters the representation and potentially the boundary conditions or system state at time t_1. Therefore, the solution u(x,T) will likely reflect the influence of both the initial conditions transformed by the Laplace transform and the intervention by the Fourier transform, dependent on how these transformations interact with the system dynamics defined by the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
