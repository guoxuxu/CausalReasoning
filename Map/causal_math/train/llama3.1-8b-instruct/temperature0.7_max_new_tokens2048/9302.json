  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nCan the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\) be directly deduced from the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) contains information about the frequency \\( \\omega \\), it is intertwined with the exponential decay imposed by \\( s \\). Without knowing the value of \\( s \\), we cannot accurately reconstruct \\( \\omega \\) from \\( g(z) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
