  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system evolves over time t and undergoes an integral transform using the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform outcome \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can it be used to determine if the original function was subjected to a damping effect or was it purely the exponential function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Differentiating whether a damping factor or other modifications (like addition of other frequency terms) were applied based solely on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is not feasible, as overlapping effects in the transform could result from various modified forms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) giving similar \\\\( F(s) \\\\) expressions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
