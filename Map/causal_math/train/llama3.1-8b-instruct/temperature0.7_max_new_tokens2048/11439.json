  "Problem": "Let us consider a system of linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-iwt}dt \\\\), on this system over time.\n\nIf a control input represented by a matrix \\\\( N \\\\) is added into the system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\) and a Fourier transform is applied, will the spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) only reflect the properties of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) at frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the control input \\\\( N \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system. The resulting spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) will then be a function not only of the matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) but also of the nature and timing of the control inputs \\\\( u(t) \\\\) applied, affecting how these matrix properties are represented in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
