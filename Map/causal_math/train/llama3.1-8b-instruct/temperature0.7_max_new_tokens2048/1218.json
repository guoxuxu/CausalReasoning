  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact of a complex function transformation defined by \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and its corresponding transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the transformation was \\\\( t^2 f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific transformation (i.e., multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\)), reconstructing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) back to its original form is ambiguous because the transformation could represent other modifications equivalent under the Laplace transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
