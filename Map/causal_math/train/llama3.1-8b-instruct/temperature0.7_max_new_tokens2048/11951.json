  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency, representing the circuit's impedance. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, is used to analyze the circuit's behavior in response to various input signals represented as functions of \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output at some time T after applying a filtering operation \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we precisely trace back and determine whether the original circuit characteristic \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) or the filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\), or both were altered?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of product operations in transformations, multiple combinations of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) configurations could result in the same output. The transformed output could result from various alterations in either \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) or \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or both, making it impossible to distinctly pin down changes to one or both without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
