  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real number representing time. We are analyzing how the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t}dt \\\\) affects our understanding of the function's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), is it possible to completely reconstruct the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over all time without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "For a simple harmonic function like \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which has a non-zero Fourier Transform only at \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\), it is entirely feasible to reconstruct the function from its Fourier Transform. However, for more complex or noise-added signals, this might not always be true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
