  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze how different scenarios involving the Laplace transformation affect the interpretation of the function and its inverse.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and then its inverse transform on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) yield back the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any alteration?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to be inverses of each other for functions within their respective classes. Assuming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) falls under conditions permissible for Laplace transformations, applying the transform followed by its inverse should ideally return the original function without alteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
