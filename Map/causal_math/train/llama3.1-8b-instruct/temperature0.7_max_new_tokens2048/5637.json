  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\) characterizing a process dependent on the variable x. We further explore how the transformations through application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined by \\\\( L(z) = z'(x) \\\\), impact the outcomes when \\\\( z(x) \\\\) evolves under a complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 + i \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf we allow \\\\( z(x) \\\\) to evolve under the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) without applying \\\\( L \\\\), will \\\\( w(z(x)) \\\\) be the same as evolving \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) under \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct application of \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) does not involve the differential operation of \\\\( L \\\\). Therefore, the output from evolving under \\\\( w \\\\) would typically differ from the transformation after applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\), as this operator alters the function's derivative structure before applying \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
