  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), which is applied to an input function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) in a linear system defined by the integral transform \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty h(t-u) x(u) du \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response. An additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is considered as an intervention.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or no intervention), solely from the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcomes measured in \\\\( y(T) \\\\) can be achieved through various combinations of interventions and initial conditions because the convolution process can mask the effects of different transformations applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The potential overlap in results from different inputs and transformations adds ambiguity in pinpointing the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
