  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in a complex domain that undergoes a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to it, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Consider also actions of modifications using multiplier functions \\\\( m(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) and \\\\( n(s) = s^b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we retrieve the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) precisely from the modified transform \\\\( F(s + a) \\\\) without prior knowledge about the multiplier \\\\( m(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific form and parameter of \\\\( m(x) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately determine how the transform was shifted in the s-domain. Thus, the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) cannot be accurately deduced only from \\\\( F(s + a) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
