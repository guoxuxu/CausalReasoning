  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit with an impedance represented by the function \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s + c} \\) in the Laplace transform domain, where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. The input to the circuit is a voltage \\( V(s) \\), and the output is current \\( I(s) \\). The response of the circuit is also influenced by an operational amplifier with a Laplace transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\), which can be switched into the circuit as an intervention.\n\nIf the input voltage \\( V(s) \\) increases, will the output current \\( I(s) = \\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)} \\) always increase proportionally without any further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The proportionality of output current to input voltage depends on the complex function \\( Z(s) \\). Since \\( Z(s) \\) contains polynomial terms in the numerator and denominator, the relationship isn't straightforward and depends on the specific values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) as well as the input frequency domain represented by \\( s \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
