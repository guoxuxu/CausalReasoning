  "Problem": "Consider the application of complex function mapping \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{z} \\\\) in the complex plane and its implications on the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\) defined for \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\\\). The Laplace transform is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the transformed output \\\\( F(w) \\\\) where \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\), can we correctly infer the original Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without any reconstructive transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\) effectively changes the domain of definition for the Laplace transform, making it non-trivial and generally impossible to reconstruct \\\\( F(s) \\\\) directly from \\\\( F(w) \\\\) without additional information or reverse transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
