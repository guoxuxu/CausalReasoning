  "Problem": "Examine the effect of performing a Laplace transform on a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\). Suppose an inverse Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to yield \\\\( g(t) \\\\). We then analyze whether the transformations preserve certain properties of the original function over time.\n\nIf given \\\\( g(t) \\\\) after an unknown transformation and subsequent Laplace inversion, can we definitively determine if the original function was non-linearly transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inversion typically do not retain information about non-linear transformations unless additional context or constraints about the transformation are provided. The linearity of the Laplace operation makes discerning modifications like non-linear scaling from the resultant \\\\( g(t) \\\\) impossible without extra data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
