  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system is initially affected by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same equation without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) alters the state at time t = 0, which subsequently affects the entire trajectory of the solution. The presence of the complex exponential matrix \\\\( A \\\\) can change both magnitude and direction of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), leading to a different outcome at any subsequent time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
