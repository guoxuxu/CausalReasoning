  "Problem": "Analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform in solving differential equations, consider a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) defined as \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) of a function y(t) is applied to convert this ODE into the algebraic equation in s-domain.\n\nGiven the final form of y(t) at some t > t_1, can we uniquely identify the exact form of the intervention (the value of r) used, assuming the original, unmodified parameters p and q are known?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple values of r could potentially result in the same final form of y(t) due to the properties of differential equations and their sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters. The overlap in potential solutions stemming from different values of r complicates unique identification of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
