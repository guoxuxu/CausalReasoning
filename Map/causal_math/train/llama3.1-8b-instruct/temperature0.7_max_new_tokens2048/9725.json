  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then evolves until \\\\( t = T \\\\) under its original formulation without intervention, will the transform \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) capture the complete behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) results in a new function \\\\( T[z](t) = -\\\\frac{e^{i \\\\omega t} - 1}{i \\\\omega} \\\\), which is a different manifestation of the original function and contains its integral, not the pointwise values. It doesn't capture the oscillatory nature fully, only the cumulative effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
