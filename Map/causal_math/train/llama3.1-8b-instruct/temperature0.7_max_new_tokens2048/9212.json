  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), generating a new function in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the transformed state in the s-domain at time T, can the type of intervention (either Laplace transform, Hilbert transform, or both) be precisely identified based on the state?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation effects of the Laplace and Hilbert transforms in the s-domain can overlap, and without explicit tracking or additional information, the type of intervention applied cannot be uniquely determined from the final state alone due to the potential equivalence in transformed outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
