  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. To analyze causal effect and intervention, we study the system's behavior under a transformation defined by \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where M is a linear operator.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the direct evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) under L for the time period T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) modifies the initial state by the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), which affects the trajectory over time. The evolution of the state at any time t = T will be different due to the initial change caused by M, as \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) and L might not commute, affecting the system's response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
