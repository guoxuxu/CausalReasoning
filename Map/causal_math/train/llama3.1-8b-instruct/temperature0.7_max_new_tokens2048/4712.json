  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined precisely which transformations were applied (whether it was \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\) or both), based solely on the information of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact series or type of transformations applied leading to the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible solely based on the end state, due to the potential overlap in changes each transformation can produce in the system. Without distinct information on how \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) interact with \\\\( P \\\\), the interventions cannot be uniquely identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
