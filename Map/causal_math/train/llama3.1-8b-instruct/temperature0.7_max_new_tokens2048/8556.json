  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nKnowing the system's state at some time T after various potential applications of external forces, can we pinpoint the exact moments and magnitudes of the forces applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interaction between the system's inherent dynamics and external forces, and their dependency on timing and magnitude, multiple different sequences and sizes of forces might yield the same final state. This ambiguity and potential for multiple valid force scenarios prevent precise back-calculation of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "p → damping; q → stiffness; f(t) → displacement; displacement → acceleration; acceleration → force; force → system state; system state → time T; time T → exact moments and magnitudes of forces"
