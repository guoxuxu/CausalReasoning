  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real number representing frequency. Evaluate the transformation by applying the Laplace transform to z(t).\n\nIf a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is introduced into the function after applying the Laplace transform, influencing the dynamics, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\alpha z(t) \\\\) differ from simply scaling the output Laplace transform by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform's linearity dictates that transforming \\\\( \\\\alpha z(t) \\\\) and scaling \\\\( L{z(t)} \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) will yield identical results. Such an intervention, despite altering system dynamics, aligns with the properties of linearity of Laplace transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
