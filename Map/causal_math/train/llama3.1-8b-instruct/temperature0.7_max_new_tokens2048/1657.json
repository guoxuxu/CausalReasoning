  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct}z dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T using the original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by adding an integral effect that modifies the paths of x and y, influenced by matrix C. This generally produces a different evolution at time T, as the integral accumulation distinctly alters the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
