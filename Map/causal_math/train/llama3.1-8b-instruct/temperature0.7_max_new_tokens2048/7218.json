  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\), is it possible to infer the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) used over the interval without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The knowledge of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) alone, without additional details about the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or the absence of other transformations or interference during the period, is insufficient to definitively determine the form or parameters of the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
