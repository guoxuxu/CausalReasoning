  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The solution at any time can be transformed using a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we reconstruct the exact initial state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation is invertible, and its application is independent of the linear time evolution due to operator \\\\(L\\\\). So, regardless of when the Fourier transformation was applied, one can accurately reconstruct \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
