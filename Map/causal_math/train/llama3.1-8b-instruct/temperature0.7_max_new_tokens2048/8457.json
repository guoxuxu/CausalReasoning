  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nIf \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(x) \\) over the path \\( \\gamma \\), then integrated, will the result of \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(z(x)) \\, dx \\) be the same as first integrating \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\) and then applying \\( T \\) to the result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) changes the nature of the integrand, potentially altering the singularities and residues inside \\( \\gamma \\). This operation is not commutative with integration, as integration first would sum the properties of \\( z \\) along \\( \\gamma \\), while applying \\( T \\) first changes these properties locally before accumulating them.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
