  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex-valued functions defined in the complex plane and the application of the Laplace transform, which is represented by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Analyze the behavior and relationships when these functions are subjected to transformations like multiplication by a constant or modification by an exponential decay factor.\n\nIf a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where a is a complex number, is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to its transform properties without further intervention, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) at any point s recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), provided Re(s) > Re(a). The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) recoveries the original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), showing that the Laplace transformation is reversible for this function under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
