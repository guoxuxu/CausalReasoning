  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T depend solely on the behavior defined by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation introduces a new dependency on the matrix C. This change affects the development of the function over time, overlapping with the effects of A and B, thus altering x and y from their paths had no transformation been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
