  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Lx \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the system's behavior under the Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state after interventions of different transformations (Fourier and Laplace transforms) and evolved under \\\\( L \\\\), can we determine the precise sequence and type of transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping and potentially non-linear interactions between Fourier and Laplace transforms when compounded with the linear operation \\\\( L \\\\), it becomes computationally ambiguous to reverse engineer the exact sequence and types of transformations. The final state could be achieved through different paths of applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
