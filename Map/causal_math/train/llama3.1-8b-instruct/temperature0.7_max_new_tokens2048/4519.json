  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( \\omega \\\\neq 0 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adds non-linear dynamics to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), affecting all frequency components. The resultant \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\) depends on both the original function and the intervention, influencing various frequency components, not just \\\\( \\omega \\\\neq 0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
