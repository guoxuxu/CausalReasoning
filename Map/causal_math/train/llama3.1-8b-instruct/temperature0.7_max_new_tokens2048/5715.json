  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifications to the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the matrices A, B (original systems), C (initial transformation), and D (intervention), affecting the complex number's trajectory and final position.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
