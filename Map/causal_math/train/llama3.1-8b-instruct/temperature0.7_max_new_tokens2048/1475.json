  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at time t, transforming the system's state.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\) will be influenced by both the initial transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the later intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\). The dynamics of the system now incorporate effects from \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), and their respective influences on the trajectory complicates the evolution to a point where \\\\( A \\\\) alone does not determine \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
