  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). The function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) undergoes a transformation involving the Fourier integral representation by applying the transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^{n+1}} e^{as} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nGiven a transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we deduce the exact form and parameters of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing whether a scaling transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about potential initial scaling (the constant \\\\( k \\\\)), we cannot uniquely reverse-engineer \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to its original form at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The scaling alters the amplitude of the time function, which is directly reflected in the transform, making it impossible to infer the exact original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
