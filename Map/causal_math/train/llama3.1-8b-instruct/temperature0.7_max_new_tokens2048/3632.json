  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic form described by \\\\( Q(x) = x^T A x \\\\), where A is a symmetric matrix. We analyze the behavior of this form under a linear transformation defined by the matrix T over the vector space.\n\nGiven the transformed quadratic form value \\\\( Q(Tx) \\\\) calculated with a transformed matrix A', can one determine whether the A was originally structured identically to A' before intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple matrix configurations (A) can transform into the same A' under different operations and yield the same quadratic form value, it is not possible to uniquely determine the original structure of A from the transformed data alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
