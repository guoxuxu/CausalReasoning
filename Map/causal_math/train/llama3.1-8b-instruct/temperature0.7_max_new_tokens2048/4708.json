  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nKnowing only the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and if so, the values of \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform component extracted by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) integrates contributions over the period and does not retain specific time-local information about when or how interventions occurred. Therefore, it is impossible to deduce the exact nature of the intervention or its parameters solely from the value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
