  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\), with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transform \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), the system's inherent properties (A and B), and the intervention \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). This combinative effect means that all matrices contribute to the trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
