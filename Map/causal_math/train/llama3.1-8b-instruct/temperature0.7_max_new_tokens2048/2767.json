  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new transformation \\\\(S(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\mu xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) is applied at a certain point \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the system's state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the original equation parameters without depending on the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and subsequently \\\\(S\\\\) significantly alter the trajectory and final state of the system. The state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) will be influenced by the initial application of \\\\(T\\\\) and later by \\\\(S\\\\), in addition to the inherent dynamics dictated by the partial differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
