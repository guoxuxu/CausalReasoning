  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), which is then altered by a transfer function \\( H(f) \\) and subsequently inverse Fourier transformed to generate \\( y(t) \\).\n\nKnowing \\( y(t) \\) and the specific type of \\( H(f) \\) applied, can we explicitly determine if an additional filter \\( G(f) \\) was used during the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of \\( H(f) \\) and observing \\( y(t) \\), identifying the application of \\( G(f) \\) requires further information or assumptions. Multiple combinations of \\( H(f) \\) and \\( G(f) \\) can yield the same \\( y(t) \\), thus not guaranteeing a unique solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
