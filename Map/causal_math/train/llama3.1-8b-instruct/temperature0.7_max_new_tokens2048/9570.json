  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\), where we transform the coordinates according to the functions \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = e^{Bt}y_0 \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We analyze the dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) over time under these transformations.\n\nCan we determine the specific values of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) given information about \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the values of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not suffice to uniquely identify \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) because different combinations of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) might yield the same result for \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without precise knowledge of the rates of increase A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
