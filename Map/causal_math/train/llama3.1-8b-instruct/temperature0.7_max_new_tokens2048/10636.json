  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the original function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) its transformation into the complex s-plane. We study the effects of a convolution operation with a kernel \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented by its transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nBased on the resultant transform \\\\( R(s) \\\\) at some future time, is it possible to determine the precise sequence of original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the intervening scaling function \\\\( p(t) \\\\) used, knowing only the resulting \\\\( R(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transform \\\\( R(s) \\\\) is a product of the transforms of all involved functions and does not retain unique information about the sequence in which functions were applied or their specific forms unless additional information is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
