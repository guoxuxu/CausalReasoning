  "Problem": "A system is defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves over time according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the system's behavior under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z(s)\\\\, ds \\\\) where B is another real constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is difficult to reconstruct \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) since the transformation involves integration which may have compounded effects due to the function \\\\( e^{iB(t-s)} \\\\), obscuring the original function's information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
