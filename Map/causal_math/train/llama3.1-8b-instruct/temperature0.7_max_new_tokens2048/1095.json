  "Problem": "Analyze the impact/casual inference of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to a continuous-time signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then investigating how the convolution of the resulting function with another function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain affects the original signal domain via the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new convolution with a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain is applied as an intervention, will the final output depend solely on the initial function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(s) \\\\) or \\\\( g(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output, after applying the convolution with \\\\( g(s) \\\\), becomes dependent on not just the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), but also on both \\\\( h(s) \\\\) and \\\\( g(s) \\\\). Each operates through convolution altering the functional response, and thus each impacts the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
