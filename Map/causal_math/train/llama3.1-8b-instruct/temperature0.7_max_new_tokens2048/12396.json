  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t governed by a set of linear differential equations in a matrix form \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) with M being a constant matrix. We evaluate how an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform and is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further transformation, will the time-domain behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T correspond to merely applying \\\\( Mz \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform has fundamentally altered the initial state in the transform domain, compressing all the time-varying behavior into the frequency-domain representation. This modification changes the perspective on the system's temporal progress and is not directly equivalent due to the properties of the Laplace transform and back transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
