  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) which is the solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} \\\\), describing heat conduction. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) to analyze its behavior under different conditions.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a boundary condition is modified or an additional heat source is introduced, affecting \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the initial conditions and not the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new boundary condition or heat source modifies the equation's dynamics and hence the resulting function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\). The Laplace transform at time T will thereby reflect both the initial conditions and effects of interventions made at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
