  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u}\\\\) to the function u and then analyzing its behavior under different scenarios.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is an invertible linear operation that does not affect the dynamics dictated by the differential operator L. The evolution under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), whether in the Fourier transformed space or the original space, should therefore yield consistent results when transformed back.",
