  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is a constant diffusion coefficient. Consider a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-iwx} u(x) dx\\\\) being applied as a transformation.\n\nIf a Fourier transform of the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) is computed, and the resulting function is evolved under the heat equation without any further transformations, will the spatial distribution of temperature \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if the initial conditions were evolved directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Fourier transform to the initial conditions changes the representation of the system from spatial to frequency domain. Although the heat equation's dynamics can still govern, the inverse transformation required to return to the original spatial domain can lead to discrepancies, depending on how the frequency components evolve over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
