  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is the temperature at a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\). We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, defined by the function \\\\(g(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{h(x, y)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(h(x, y)\\\\) describes initial temperature distribution along the boundary.\n\nIf the Fourier transformed boundary condition \\\\(g(s)\\\\) is set at t = 0 and the system evolves under the Laplace equation without further intervention, does the steady-state solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) depend on the form of \\\\(g(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial boundary condition, transformed via Fourier, directly shapes the solution of the Laplace equation. The Fourier components in \\\\(g(s)\\\\) determine how heat diffuses through the domain, influencing the steady-state distribution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
