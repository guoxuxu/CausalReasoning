  "Problem": "Consider a function represented as a complex map \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where c is a constant complex number. This map is used iteratively from an initial point z_0 in the complex plane to study its dynamic evolution.\n\nGiven a sequence converging to a fixed point in the complex map, is it possible to definitively determine the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the constant \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can generate sequences that converge to the same fixed point due to the non-injective nature of the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Thus, knowing the convergence point alone does not uniquely identify \\\\( c \\\\) or \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z; c → g(z); z → g(z); g(z) → z; z → convergence; c → convergence; convergence → fixed point; fixed point → z_0",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of c determines the convergence of the sequence, which in turn determines the fixed point, which is a result of the iterative application of g(z), and the initial point z0 is related to the fixed point."
