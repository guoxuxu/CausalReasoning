  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, and let \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) represent the potential at a point (x, y). The Fourier transformation is applied to \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\(U(k, y)\\\\) dependent on wavenumber k and y.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(U(k, Y)\\\\) at y = Y, can we identify whether any intervention was made at y = Y1 < Y, and if so, can we ascertain the nature of this intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\(U(k, Y)\\\\) could be influenced by changes at Y1 or merely by the natural evolution under the Laplace equation from \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\). Without explicit constraints or details on the nature of potential interventions at Y1, it is indeterminate from the data at Y alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transformation → transformed function U(k, Y); Laplace equation → potential u(x, y); wavenumber k → transformed function U(k, Y); y → potential u(x, y); y = Y1 < Y → intervention; intervention → nature of intervention; Fourier transformation → potential u(x, y)"
