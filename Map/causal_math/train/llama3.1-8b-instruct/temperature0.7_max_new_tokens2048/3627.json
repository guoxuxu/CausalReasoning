  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) tracing a path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, at different time intervals.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the natural dynamics and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another rotational factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), in addition to the natural dynamics of the function. The rotations will affect the trajectory and the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through the cumulative effect of the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
