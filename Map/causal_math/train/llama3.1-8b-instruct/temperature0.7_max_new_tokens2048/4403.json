  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + \\\\alpha v \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant. We also consider the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an impulse \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_1) \\\\) is added to \\\\( u(t) \\\\), will the endpoint Laplace transform \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original differential equations and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the impulse modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the subsequent evolution of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) under their differential equations. This change will be reflected in the Laplace transform of the function at any later time T, making the resultant transform dependent on the nature and timing of the intervention as well as the original dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
