  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) known as the Laplace Transform, on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) without any further analytical manipulation, will the resulting function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) be a valid representation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) for \\\\( Re(s) > Re(A) \\\\), correctly represents the function in the s-domain by transforming it according to its definition. This agrees with the integral transformation properties and does not require additional intervention for validity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
