  "Problem": "Consider a set of eigenfunctions \\\\( v_n \\\\) associated with an operator \\\\( L \\\\) and a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) that can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions. The impact of applying Fourier series transformation and its inverse is analyzed over function \\\\( f(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier series transformation is applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\), then the function evolves naturally (i.e., under its inherent properties without external modifications) during the application, will \\\\( f(x) \\\\) still represent the same initial physical phenomena?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier series transformation decomposes the function into a sum of sinusoids or exponential functions which are eigenfunctions if the domain and boundary conditions align with the operator (L). Since this transformation is reversible and preserves the information of the original function, the integrity and representation of the initial physical phenomena are maintained.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier series transformation → linear combination of eigenfunctions; eigenfunctions → f(x); f(x) → initial physical phenomena; linear combination of eigenfunctions → f(x); f(x) → eigenfunctions; linear combination of eigenfunctions → f(x) → initial physical phenomena; eigenfunctions → f(x) → initial physical phenomena"
