  "Problem": "Consider a model for the propagation of a signal \\\\(s(t)\\\\) through a medium, where the signal is initially transformed by a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\), and the medium's response is modeled by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. The propagation is analyzed at various times t under different transformations.\n\nIf the signal \\\\( s(x) \\\\) undergoes the transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\) at x = 0 and is then propagated through the medium modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\) without any further transformations, will the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to direct propagation of \\\\( s(0) \\\\) without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the form of the signal entering the medium, which changes the evolution dynamics under the medium's response governed by L. This different initial state results in a different state at time T compared to if the signal had not been transformed initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
