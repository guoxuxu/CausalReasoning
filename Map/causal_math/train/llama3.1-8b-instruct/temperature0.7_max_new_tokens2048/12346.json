  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf during the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), an impulse function \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\) is added at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will this intervention affect the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the impulse function \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\) introduces a new element into \\\\(z(t)\\\\), specifically adding a spike at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\). This alteration translates to a change in the Fourier Transform, specifically, adding a term \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega t_0} \\\\) that shifts the phases in the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
