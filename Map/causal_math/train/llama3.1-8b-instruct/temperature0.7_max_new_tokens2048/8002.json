  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation under various conditions. We analyze the impact of a non-linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(v) = \\\\sinh(kv) \\\\) where k is a constant, on the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) of the fluid.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) after observing the fluid's velocity \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\), any observed changes in the velocity profile at time T could be due to the effects of the transformation or inherent non-linearities of the system. The initial state cannot be unequivocally determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
