  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) and its impact on a domain in the complex plane. We analyze how a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), acts on this function.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform process is generally irreversible without additional constraints or information about the original function domain or conditions. Particularly, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) only provides frequency-domain information and losses specific details about the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
