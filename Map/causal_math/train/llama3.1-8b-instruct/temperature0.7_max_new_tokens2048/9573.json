  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ku \\\\), with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{\\\\alpha t}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, is analyzed.\n\nIf the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is given as \\\\( u(t) = ce^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants) from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), and no transformation is applied except the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + ku \\\\), will the form of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) solely depend on the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no transformation alters the dynamics except the inherent differential equation, \\\\( F(z) \\\\)'s outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\) depends only on how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves due to the given dynamics and input function. Parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are sufficient to determine \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",
