  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system is subject to an input function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) affecting the system's state. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, is used to analyze the behavior over time.\n\nIf the system is initially at rest and an input \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further input, will the transformed system state \\\\( U(s) \\\\) (Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\)) be a function of the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system was initially at rest and only a single input was introduced, the system's behavior is fully characterized by the input under the linear time-invariant properties. Thus, \\\\( U(s) \\\\) depends directly on the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), implying a direct causal relationship from the input to the resulting state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
