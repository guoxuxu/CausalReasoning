  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) obey the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with A, B, C, D being constants. We examine the impact of a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initially given by \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and is evolved under its differential equations to a time T, will \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) computed at s=0 be directly equal to the integration of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from 0 to T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the entire functional form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), integrating it exponentially scaled, thus the transformation changes the resultant functional behavior and its integration, making it different from a simple integration from 0 to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
