  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the post-intervention state, can we determine what value \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) was used, knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and assuming no additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\alpha Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) yields a result where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) influences the magnitude but is indistinguishable without initial or final condition knowledge. Without information about the scale of changes or original values, multiple values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) could result in the same transformed characteristics under varying scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
