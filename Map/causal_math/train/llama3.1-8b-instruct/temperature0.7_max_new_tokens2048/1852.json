  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We study the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) being another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations were applied (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( R(z) \\\\), or both) throughout the evolution, by solely knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential transformations coupled with integrals make it extremely difficult to uniquely backtrack the exact interventions (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) or \\\\( R(z) \\\\ or both) used during the system's evolution, as multiple combinations could yield equivalent final states due to the properties of exponential sums and integrals in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
