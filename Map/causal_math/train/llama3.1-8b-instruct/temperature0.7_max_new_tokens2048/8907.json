  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its impact when integrated over a contour in the complex plane. The contour described by the path \\\\( C \\\\) is parameterized by \\\\( z(t) = a + te^{it} \\\\) for \\\\( t \\\\) ranging from 0 to 2\\\\pi, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain parameter point \\\\( t_1 \\\\) on the contour \\\\( C \\\\), the function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) is intentionally modified to \\\\( g(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, will the final integral value over \\\\( C \\\\) now be determined uniquely by the nature of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and not by \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) introduces a new factor depending on the constant \\\\( k \\\\). While it distinctly influences the integral, the resulting integral value would still depend on the interplay between parts of the contour under \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and parts under \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and not solely on \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
