  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model for population growth under limited resources, described by the logistic differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dp}{dt} = rp(1 - \\\\frac{p}{K})\\\\), where \\\\(p\\\\) is the population, \\\\(r\\\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\\\(K\\\\) is the carrying capacity. We explore the impact of a harvesting rate represented by a function \\\\(h(p) = Hp\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant, that could be applied to the population over time.\n\nCan we identify the initial population \\\\(p_0\\\\) after observing the population \\\\(p(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing the harvesting rate H?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the harvesting rate \\\\(H\\\\), it's impossible to accurately deduce the original population \\\\(p_0\\\\) since the harvesting intervenes directly and changes the initial condition that dictates the future population under the logistic growth formula.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
