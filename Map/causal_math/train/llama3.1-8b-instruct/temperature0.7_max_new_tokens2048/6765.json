  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\). We explore the effects of a multiplied exponential function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and its corresponding Laplace transformation \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} (s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and then transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( F(s-a) \\\\), the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and subsequent transformation correctly results in a domain shift. This follows from the property of the Laplace transform where multiplying by an exponential results in a shift in the s-domain, i.e., \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ e^{at} f(t) \\\\} (s) = F(s-a) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
