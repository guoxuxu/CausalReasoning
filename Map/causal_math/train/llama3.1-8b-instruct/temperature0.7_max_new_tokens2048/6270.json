  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and let's analyze its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\).\n\nGiven that the output from \\\\( I[z](t) \\\\) results periodically in zero across times, can we infer that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was never transformed by any factor other than unity?",
  "Explanation": "The alternating nature of the complex exponential function and the specific format of \\\\( I[z](t) \\\\) causing periodic zeros indicates that no additional transformation was applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Any other factor of transformation would alter this periodic nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
