  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where L is a linear operator. We are also interested in the effect of a transformation represented by the operator \\\\( P(t) = e^{Mt} \\\\), with M being another constant operator. This transformation is applied to the initial condition prior to evolution under the system's dynamics.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the system dynamics to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P(0) = e^{M0} = I \\\\) still yields \\\\( x_0 \\\\); however, the subsequent evolution differs because \\\\( P(t) \\\\) alters the state at subsequent times, influencing the trajectory distinctly depending on M's relationship with L, resulting in a potential deviation at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
