  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + u \\\\), with D being a constant matrix and u representing external control influences. We study the system behavior under the intervention of a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce whether and which interventions (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, by only knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions due to the non-commutative nature and dynamic interactions of matrix exponentials. Without distinct evidence of how each transformation impacts the system, which can overlap in effects, it remains uncertain which, if any, interventions were definitely used. The ambiguous nature of how these transformations impact the system trajectory prevents a clear determination.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
