  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Let the causality of this transformation be examined considering both linear differential equations and external interventions in the form of multiplicative exponential functions.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant matrix is applied at any time during the evaluation of \\\\( h(z(s)) \\\\), will the outcome at \\\\( s \\\\) still solely depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\) changes the function being transformed to \\\\( e^{Bt}e^{At} \\\\), which results in a modified Laplace transform incorporating both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The final transform at any \\\\( s \\\\) will reflect contributions from both matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
