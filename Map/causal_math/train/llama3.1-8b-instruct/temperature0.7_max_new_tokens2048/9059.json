  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf after a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is altered to a new control \\\\( v(t) \\\\), will the system's output \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) rely exclusively on the new control input \\\\( v(t) \\\\) irrespective of the initial conditions set by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and D?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects both the integral's future values and the system's response due to the integral's dependency on past values of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Additionally, the transformation matrix D impacts the resulting system output, tying the output to all previous system states and inputs, not just \\\\( v(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
