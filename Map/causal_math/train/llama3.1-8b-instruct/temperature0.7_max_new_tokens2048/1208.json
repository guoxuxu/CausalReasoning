  "Problem": "Assume a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform on this function over the variable t.\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform at s after a frequency-changing intervention, can we determine which frequency was present before the intervention, between the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or the altered \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform at s will be \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega'} \\\\) due to the intervention, showing the pole at \\\\( i\\omega' \\\\). Without knowledge of the intervention applied, it is impossible to deduce the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) solely from the transform, as it only reveals the post-intervention frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
