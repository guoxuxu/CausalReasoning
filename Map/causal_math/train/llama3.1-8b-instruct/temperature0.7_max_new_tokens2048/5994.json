  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. This function is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\). We analyze the impact of altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through an applied transformation \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real number.\n\nCan we deduce the initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot confirm if the observed frequency changes in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) were exclusively due to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or a combination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Therefore, deducing the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) with certainty from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is not possible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
