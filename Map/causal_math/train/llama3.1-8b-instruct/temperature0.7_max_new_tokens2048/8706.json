  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nCan the original control input U(s) to a linear time-invariant system be uniquely determined after observing the output Y(s) at time t = T without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific transfer function H(s) or without deconvolution capabilities, determining U(s) just from Y(s) is generally not possible because multiple distinct inputs can produce similar outputs in such systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → b; b → s^2; s^2 + b → H(s); H(s) → Y(s); U(s) → H(s); U(s) → Y(s); U(s) → a; U(s) → b; U(s) → s^2; U(s) → Y(s) at t = T"
