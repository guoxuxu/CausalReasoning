  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on a complex domain \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) are the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Assume that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, indicating that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is holomorphic. We study the impact of an integral transformation represented by \\\\( \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(z) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a real or complex constant.\n\nIf during the transformation process, an additional function \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which is non-holomorphic, is applied to the system as an intervention, will the final output of the transformation depend exclusively on the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a non-holomorphic function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) affects the property of the initial function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) within the transformation. This interaction changes the system's behavior, indicating the output now depends both on the characteristics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the applied function \\\\( g(z) \\\\). These influences are not separable due to the composite nature of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
