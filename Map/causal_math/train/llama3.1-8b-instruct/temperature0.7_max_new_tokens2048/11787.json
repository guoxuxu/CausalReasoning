  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where u and v are real-valued functions of time governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\lambda\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants. The scenario explores the consequences of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the complex function's behavior over time, with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) as a complex constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine which intervention (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) was applied, given only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The similar effects of scaling and rotating by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), overlapping and potentially interacting complex exponentials, render it impossible to uniquely back-calculate the interventions used from the endpoint alone. The trajectories could converge to similar points from different combinations of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
