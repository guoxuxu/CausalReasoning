  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = v\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) describes the voltage distribution over a line at position x and time t, and v is a positive constant reflecting the properties of the material. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\) at time t = 0.\n\nCan we determine the original voltage distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) after observing the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature and reversibility of the Fourier transformation, it's possible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), regardless of the knowledge about the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
