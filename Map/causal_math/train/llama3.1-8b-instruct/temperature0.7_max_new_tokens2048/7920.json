  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were executed (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on the observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The contributions from \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\) can superimpose in multiple ways to produce the same endpoint state due to periodicity and overlapping effects in frequency and phase modulation. This multiplicity in potential trajectory histories prevents unique determination of intervention history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
