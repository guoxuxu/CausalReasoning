  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of this transformation is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the initial value of \\\\( z \\\\) by scaling it exponentially with a factor dependent on time and the constant \\\\( A \\\\). This will affect the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time, leading to a different value at t = T compared to just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without the initial transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
