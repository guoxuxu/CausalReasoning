  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant complex number. Consider the Beta transformation defined as \\\\( h(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying a transformation \\\\( k(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where R is another constant complex number, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the cumulative effects of P, Q, and the intervention R. The application of \\\\( k(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further complicates the trajectory by introducing another exponential scale factor, making the final outcome a result of interactions between all contributing transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
