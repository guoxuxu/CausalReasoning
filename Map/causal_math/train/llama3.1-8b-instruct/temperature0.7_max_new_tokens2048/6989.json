  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\) governing the temperature field \\( u \\) over a domain, affected by an external heat source modulated by the function \\( h(t, x) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega x) \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are constants.\n\nIf the external source \\( h(t, x) \\) starts affecting the system at \\( t = 0 \\) and no further manipulations are made, will the temperature profile \\( u(x, t) \\) at any later time \\( t = T \\) depend only on the initial temperature distribution \\( u(x, 0) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( h(t, x) \\) alters the heat distribution by adding or subtracting to the original heat profile over time, creating a dependency on both \\( h(t, x) \\) and \\( u(x, 0) \\). The heat equation dynamics are fundamentally affected by this external source, making the state at time \\( T \\) dependent on it as well as the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
