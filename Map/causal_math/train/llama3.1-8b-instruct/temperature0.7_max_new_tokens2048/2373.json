  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) in the complex plane where \\( A \\) is a non-scalar constant matrix. Examine the evolution of the function under different mappings and their compositional effects.\n\nIf a linear transformation \\( T(z) = Bz \\), where \\( B \\) is a constant matrix, is applied to \\( z \\) before \\( f \\), will \\( f(T(z)) \\) at any arbitrary \\( z \\) be the same as if \\( f \\) was directly applied to \\( z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( f(T(z)) = e^{ABz} \\) may not be equivalent to \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) due to the potential non-commutativity of matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) leading to \\( AB \\neq BA \\), thus altering the output substantially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
