  "Problem": "Analyze a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) is considered as an intervention on the system, with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), the system undergoes an intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) applied, will the output at \\\\( z = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > z_1 \\\\) solely depend on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces external influence via matrix \\\\( B \\\\). Thus, the system's state at \\\\( T \\\\) becomes a function of both matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), influenced by the compounding effects of two exponential transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
