  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Here, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is described by the time-domain differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal or control function. The Fourier transform is taken with respect to the function after applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nAfter computing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) at t = T, can we trace back and determine if the transformation \\\\( f(x) = Dx \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{ x(t) \\\\} \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) contains detailed frequency information, but it does not necessarily isolate the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( Dx \\\\) applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). Multiple transformations can result in the same frequency-domain representation when combined with the effects of \\\\( Ax + Bu \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
