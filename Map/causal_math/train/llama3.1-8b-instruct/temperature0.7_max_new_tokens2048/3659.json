  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\), where D represents a diffusion constant. We also consider the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a wave number.\n\nIf, at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S(u) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on D and not on the properties of the transformations \\\\( T(u) \\\\) or \\\\( S(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The second transformation \\\\( S(u) \\\\) acts as an intervention which can modify how the solution propagates forward according to the diffusion equation. Both transformations \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\) can change key features of the solution, including phase and amplitude of components by their respective Fourier transforms, influencing the final state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
