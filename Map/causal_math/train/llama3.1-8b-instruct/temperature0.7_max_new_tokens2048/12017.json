  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nGiven the knowledge of the transformed function \\\\( T[w](z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we deduce the form of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) accurately without knowing A?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function only provides information about the cumulative effect of \\\\( w(s) \\\\) from 0 to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) and not the specific configuration or constant A without additional information; hence, reversing the transformation to pinpoint \\\\( w(0) = e^{A \\cdot 0} \\\\) specifically isn't feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
