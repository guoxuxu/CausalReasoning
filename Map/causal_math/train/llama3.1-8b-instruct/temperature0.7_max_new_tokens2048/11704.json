  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) \\\\) on the function, shaping how it evolves over time.\n\nGiven a transformed and modified function in the Laplace domain, can one definitively trace back to both the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the exact nature of the intervention (like multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\)) applied in the transform space?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple original functions and/or interventions can yield the same modified transform depending on the properties of the operations applied in the Laplace domain. Without explicit details of the intervention, the process is not reversible uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
