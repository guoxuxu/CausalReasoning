  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its effect through an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter. We examine the behaviors of different functions and the impact of alterations to the integral transform.\n\nGiven the output of the integral transformation \\\\(T[h](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s}\\\\) for some function \\\\(h\\\\), can we deduce that the original function was \\\\(h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) without additional information about modifications to the function or integral?",
  "Explanation": "Although the particular integral transformation of \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) leads to \\\\(T[f](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s}\\\\), without knowing if the function or the integral method was modified, other functions or transformations could potentially yield the same result due to the properties of Laplace and Mellin transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
