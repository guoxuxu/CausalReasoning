  "Problem": "Consider a system given by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents an input function to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) at different time points on system behavior.\n\nCan we precisely determine the sequence and types of interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(y) \\\\) at t = 0, \\\\( k(y) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), or both) by analyzing the system output at \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions from the system output at T is challenging due to the potential overlap in the effects of transformations \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). These transformations can conceal each other's presence or effects, leading to indeterminate conclusions about what specific interventions were employed during the system's evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
