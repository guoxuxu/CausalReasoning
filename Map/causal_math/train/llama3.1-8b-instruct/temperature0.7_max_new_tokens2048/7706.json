  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) was applied, it is challenging to reverse-engineer the initial condition due to possible modifications in the frequency components of \\\\( u \\\\), which are affected differently by \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
