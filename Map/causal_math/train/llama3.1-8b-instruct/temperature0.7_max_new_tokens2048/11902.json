  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(x) = Ux \\\\) at time t = 0, where U is a unitary matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(x) = Vx \\\\) (where V is another unitary matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on U or V?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent not only on D but also significantly on both U and V. The system's trajectory is altered at two points: initially by U and later by V, changing the pathway of evolution under D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
