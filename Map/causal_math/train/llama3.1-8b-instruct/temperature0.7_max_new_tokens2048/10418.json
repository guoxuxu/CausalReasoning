  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(s) ds \\\\), with the kernel transformation \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-st} \\\\). We explore the impact of a modifying function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the system over the variable t.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T > 0 \\\\), can we exactly deduce the initial condition \\\\( z'(0) \\\\) under the transformation without knowing whether the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation masks the direct impact of the initial condition due to integration over all time and space variables. Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the initial condition \\\\( z'(0) \\\\) could be any value modified by possible square functions or other transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
