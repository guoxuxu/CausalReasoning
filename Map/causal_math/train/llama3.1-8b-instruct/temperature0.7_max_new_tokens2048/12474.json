  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) representing a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\), and how it maps the function into a complex frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\omega + \\delta)t} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform still reflect the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the intervention \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the frequency of the signal, and this alteration will be reflected in the new Laplace transform, which becomes \\\\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i(\\omega + \\delta)} \\\\). The transform is therefore directly influenced by both the original frequency and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
