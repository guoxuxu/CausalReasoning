  "Problem": "Analyze the vector field transformation under a nonlinear map \\\\(G(z) = z^2 + c\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) are complex numbers, and the implementation of the Laplace transform on the time trajectories of a function \\\\( h(t) = Re(G(e^{i\\\\omega t})) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) as defined undergoes a natural evolution without any further transformation, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( T \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Under natural evolution, the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) remains determined by the interplay between \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), and the inherent dynamics of the quadratic map, with no other external influences altering the trajectory before applying the Laplace transform. Thus, the Laplace transform at time \\\\( T \\\\) encapsulates these initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
