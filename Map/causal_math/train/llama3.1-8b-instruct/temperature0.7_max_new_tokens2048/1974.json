  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) which converts the function u(x, t) into its frequency components \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Fourier transform is invertible and unique, the reconstruction of the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) is feasible through the inverse Fourier transform and the inverse operation related to the differential operator L, assuming that L permits such operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
