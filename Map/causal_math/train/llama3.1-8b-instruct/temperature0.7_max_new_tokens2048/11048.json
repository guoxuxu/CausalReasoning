  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) in terms of time \\( t \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0 \\), where \\( \\zeta \\) is the damping ratio and \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the natural frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform and its inverse under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the output \\( x(t) \\) after applying both the original system dynamics and an unknown external intervention, can we accurately recover the exact nature and timing of the external intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( x(t) \\) is a result of both the intrinsic system properties and the external force. Without additional information regarding the nature of the intervention (such as the exact form of \\( f(t) \\)), it is generally impossible to uniquely determine the specifics of the intervention solely from \\( x(t) \\) due to the superposition of effects in linear systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
