  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a differential operator. We are interested in the behavior under the transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), which integrates along the spatial variable x with a decay term dependent on time t.\n\nIf \\\\( G(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the PDE \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) evolves without further intervention, will the resulting function \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) were directly evolved under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(u) \\\\) changes the spatial dynamics of the system by integrating with a decay factor which inherently alters the initial condition. This alteration likely results in different trajectories when the system evolves under the operator L, leading to different states at any future time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
