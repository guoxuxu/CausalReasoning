  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier Transform, resulting in \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). To further analyze or manipulate the signal, an operator \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( x''(t) \\\\), the inverse Fourier Transform of \\\\( Q(\\\\omega)P(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine what specific operations represented by \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal \\\\( x''(t) \\\\) is an amalgamation of transformations by both \\\\( P(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(\\\\omega) \\\\). These operations could overlap or mask each other’s effects, making it impossible to precisely discern what transformations were applied to \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) from the resultant \\\\( x''(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
