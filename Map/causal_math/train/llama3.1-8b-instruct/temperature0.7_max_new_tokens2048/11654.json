  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), described by the equation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-P} \\\\) where P is a complex constant. The integrative effect of a modification function \\\\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\\\) applied at time t=0 is analyzed, where k is a positive integer.\n\nCan we accurately infer \\\\( u(t) \\\\) directly from the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) \\\\) at any s without original knowledge of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) being applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(v)(s) \\\\) without the information about the application of \\\\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\\\) complicates retrieving \\\\( u(t) \\\\) because the transformation induced by multiplication with \\\\( t^k \\\\) changes the poles and zeroes in the s-domain, obscuring the original function's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
