  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), such that \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} \\\\) represents the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into the complex frequency domain. Let us analyze how the convolution operation with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) affects the transformed system.\n\nGiven the output transform \\\\( J(s) \\\\) after an unknown intervention changed \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to some \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we determine what the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was and whether an intervention occurred, solely based on knowing \\\\( J(s) = F(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transform \\\\( J(s) \\\\) does not reveal sufficient information to backtrack and uniquely determine both the original function and the type or effect of intervention. Multiple plausible scenarios could lead to the same resultant transform, thus indicating a lack of unique causal inference from effect to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → F(s); g(t) → G(s); H(s) → J(s); F(s) → J(s); g(t) → J(s); H(s) → J(s) is an intervention; G(s) → F(s)H(s); J(s) → H(s) is an effect of the intervention; G(s) → J(s) is an indirect effect of the intervention; g(t) → J(s) is an indirect effect of the intervention"
