  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(t, y(t)) = \\\\int_0^T k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a function of time evolved from initial conditions under some autonomous differential equation. We test causal reasoning about the impact of modifying the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the kernel function \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) to another kernel function \\\\( k''(t, s) \\\\) at a time t_1 (0 < t_1 < T), will the transformed output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend on the original kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) or just on \\\\( k''(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) will depend on both the original kernel function and the intervened kernel, as the overall transformation up to time T is affected by contributions from both kernel functions within their respective time intervals. The nature of the integral transformation accumulates effects over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
