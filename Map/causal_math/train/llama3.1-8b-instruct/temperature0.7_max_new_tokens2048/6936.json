  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both), solely by knowing the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) could result from numerous combinations of \\( N \\), \\( Q \\), and \\( M \\) actions due to the integral influence and overlapping effects of the transformations. The lack of a one-to-one correspondence between initial transformations and final states means multiple scenarios could yield the same endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
