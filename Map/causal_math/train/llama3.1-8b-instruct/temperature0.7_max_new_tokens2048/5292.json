  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). An integral transformation using a kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) = e^{-(u^2+v^2)} \\\\) is applied, transforming the function to \\\\( F(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int e^{-(u^2+v^2)}(x^2 + y^2) dx dy \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final outcome \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) after multiple integral transformations, can we determine exactly whether the original function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) or the later transformation \\\\( G(u,v) \\\\) had a more significant influence?",
  "Explanation": "It is challenging to quantify the influence of the original function versus subsequent transformations purely based on the outcome \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\). Each transformation can significantly change and mask the effects of the others, resulting in an outcome reflective of an integrated influence rather than distinct contributory effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
