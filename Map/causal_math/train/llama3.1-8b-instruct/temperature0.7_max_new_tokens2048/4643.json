  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) described by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We examine the scenario where the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), is applied to explore the integral transformations over the complex function f.\n\nAssuming an intervention where we apply an additional transformation, say integral shift by a constant \\\\( c \\\\) to f before applying the Laplace transform to get \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{c t}f)(s) \\\\), will the outcome depend exclusively on the initial form of f without considering the shift?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced shift transformation \\\\( e^{ct} \\\\) adds an additional layer to the function, modifying the Laplace transform result. Thus, the outcome depends not only on the original function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) but also significantly on the parameter c of the intervention. This shift impacts the effective decay rate in the Laplace domain, altering results.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
