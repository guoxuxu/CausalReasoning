  "Problem": "Suppose a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz + I(t)\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\(I(t)\\\\) represents a time-dependent input. The transformation defined by \\\\(g(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is another constant complex matrix, is considered.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz\\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will modify the initial condition to \\\\( e^{Kt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which will lead to a different trajectory when evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Hz \\\\) owing to the change in initial conditions and the influence of the matrix \\\\(K\\\\) over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
