  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant. The function describes a point moving in a complex plane. We explore the relationship between linear transformations given by matrices and their effects on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nIf the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az \\\\\\) with a complex matrix A is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\\\) and the system evolves according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at any time T be identical to that of a system where no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az \\\\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the trajectory. The evolution of \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) under this transformation will generally not be the same as without it, due to matrix A altering the magnitude and perhaps the direction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
