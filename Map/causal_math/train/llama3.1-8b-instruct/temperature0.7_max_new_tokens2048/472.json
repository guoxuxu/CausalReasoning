  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are matrices denoting the system dynamics and input matrix, respectively. We analyze the effect of the linear state feedback controller defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing that controllers were applied, can we determine exactly which controllers (K, L, or both) were applied just by analyzing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of controllers and system parameters can result in the same end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), especially if the actions of K and L overlap in their influence on system dynamics. Without more detailed information on the system's evolution over time, the specific interventions cannot be resolved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state x(T) is directly influenced by the controller u, which is determined by the system dynamics M and input matrix N, as well as the controller K."
