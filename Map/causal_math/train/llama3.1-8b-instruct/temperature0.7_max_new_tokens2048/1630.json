  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Sx} \\\\) where S is a constant matrix, used to solve the complex function equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}z = Pz \\\\), with P as another constant matrix. The effect of transformations using additional operator \\\\( T(x) = e^{Qx} \\\\) over variable x, where Q is also a constant matrix, is studied.\n\nUsing only the information of \\\\( z(X) \\\\) at x = X, can one deduce the original function at x = 0 without knowing if \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), it's uncertain if the function has been altered by \\\\( e^{Qx} \\\\). This transformation could have changed the trajectory in a way that isn't directly reversible, especially if Q does not commute with P.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
