  "Problem": "Consider the problem of heat distribution over a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion constant and u(x, t) represents the temperature. An integral transformation using the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the solution's behavior.\n\nCan the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be determined accurately from the temperature distribution at a later time T, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), without using the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusion process generally smooths out temperature differences, making it inherently lossy in terms of the information about the initial state. Without the Fourier transformation's frequency domain representation, it's challenging to reconstruct the precise initial condition just from knowledge of the state at a later time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
