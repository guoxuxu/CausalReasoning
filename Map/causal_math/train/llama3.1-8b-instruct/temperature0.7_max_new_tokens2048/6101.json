  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = u(x) + iv(x) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform to this function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\). This transform takes a complex-valued function of a real variable and transforms it into a function of the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without any additional functional transformation, will the poles of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) solely depend on the characteristics of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform's effect on the complex function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and resulting poles depends directly on the behaviors and singularities of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x) \\\\). Any poles in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) arise due to characteristics inherent in these underlying functions, reflecting their rates of increase or points of discontinuity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
