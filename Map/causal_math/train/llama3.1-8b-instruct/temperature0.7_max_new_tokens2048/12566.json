  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices and x is the initial state vector. We explore how the Laplace Transform and its inverse affect the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a matrix D is multiplied to the state vector and then the system evolves until time T, will the effect of the matrices A and C still determine the state at T, independent of D?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of the matrix D modifies the state vector at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), altering the subsequent evolution dictated by \\\\( Ce^{At}x \\\\). The final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is then a result of the influence of A, C, and the intervention D applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
