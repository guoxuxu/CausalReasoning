  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t)\\\\,dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). This transformation modifies how we analyze the behavior of signals and systems in engineering and physics.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) always be exactly determined from its Laplace transform \\\\( z(w) \\\\) without knowing whether any modifications (like Plus \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, despite being a useful analytical tool, does not always uniquely identify the original function unless conditions about the function, like minimum phase or zero conditions, are known. Modifications like addition of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) can change the original function in ways that are not reversible solely from the transform \\\\( z(w) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "w(t) → z(w); z(w) → w(t); h(t) → z(w); z(w) → h(t) is not always the case"
