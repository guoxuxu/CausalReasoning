  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) in the complex plane, and its transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\). We explore how manipulating the function and its transform affects causal relationships within these systems.\n\nHaving observed the final output after consecutive Fourier and Laplace transformations, can we trace back and uniquely determine if the initial function was \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) or some other function?",
  "Explanation": "The superposition of different integral transformations (Fourier followed by Laplace) complicates the discernibility of the original function form. Multiple original functions can yield similar or the same transformed results, making unique identification of the initial functional relationship impossible without more specific information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
