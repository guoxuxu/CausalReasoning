  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a function of time. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on the Laplace transform.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a differential operation (for example, taking \\\\( df/dt \\\\)) before the multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform be equivalent to \\\\( sF(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differential operation prior to the multiplication results in \\\\( d/dt(e^{\\\\alpha t}f(t)) = \\\\alpha e^{\\\\alpha t}f(t) + e^{\\\\alpha t}df/dt \\\\), but the dominant effect on the Laplace transform yields \\\\( sF(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\) after integrating by parts and assuming boundary terms vanish. This indicates the transformations cumulatively lead to \\\\( sF(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
