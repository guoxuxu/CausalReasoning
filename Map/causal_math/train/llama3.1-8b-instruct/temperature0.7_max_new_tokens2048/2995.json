  "Problem": "Consider a vector space V over complex numbers, governed by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\). The causal structure of the system is manipulated using a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(t) e^{-iwt} dt \\\\), where w represents angular frequency and v(t) is a vector in V at time t.\n\nAssuming an intervention applying another functional operation \\\\( G(v) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(t) e^{kt} dt \\\\) (where k is a constant) is applied at t_1, would the system state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on the Fourier transform used initially?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( G(v) \\\\) as an intervention contributes an additional layer of complexity by altering the initial effects of the Fourier transform. Consequently, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will depend on the interplay between the original Fourier transform, the applied transform \\\\( G \\\\), and the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\). The transformations integrate through convolution, intertwining their effects on \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
