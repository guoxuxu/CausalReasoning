  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} ds \\), which represents a transformation applied to a real domain variable t. Here, s is a complex parameter and we are analyzing the behavior under linear transformations represented by matrix multiplication.\n\nBy observing the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we deduce the input parameter t at T=0 and specifically whether a matrix transformation was applied, without prior knowledge of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex exponential nature of the function and its sensitivity to initial conditions modified by a matrix, it's not possible to uniquely determine the initial parameter t or whether matrix A was used from the end result, due to potential multiple generating conditions that could yield the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
