  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Question the impact of applying a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^k \\\\) at different times, where k is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of certainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) means that from \\\\( z(T) \\\\), which could be either \\\\( e^{AT}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{AT}(z_0^k) \\\\), we cannot unambiguously revert to the exact \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since multiple initial states through transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) could lead to the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
