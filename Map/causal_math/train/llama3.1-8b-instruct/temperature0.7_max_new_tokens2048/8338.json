  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform applied on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We explore the causal implications of manipulating the function after its transform, by applying a frequency filter function \\\\( F(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed and filtered function \\\\( H(s)F(s) \\\\), can one uniquely determine \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\( a \\\\) in the filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) is critical to correctly back-transform the function to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) since the filtering process can equivalently be a result of different initial functions or different values of \\\\( a \\\\). Without this, the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be precisely recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
