  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. We evaluate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) applied at different points in time and its implications under the dynamics governed by matrix \\\\( A \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (with \\\\( C \\\\) being another complex matrix) occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) and depend only on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the transformations, \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( k(z) \\\\), impose changes to the system's evolution. The overall state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), will now reflect the influences of matrices \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( A \\\\), demonstrating the combined effect of these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
