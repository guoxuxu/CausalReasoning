  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed only by the evolution dictated by the equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the path had \\\\( z_0 \\\\) been evolved directly under the given stochastic differential equation without the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( S^{-1}z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which affects the trajectory of the system. The stochastic components further contribute to a unique path due to initial state variations and random perturbations from the Wiener process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
