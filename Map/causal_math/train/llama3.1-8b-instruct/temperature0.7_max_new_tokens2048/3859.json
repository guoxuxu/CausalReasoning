  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) over time t, where S is a complex constant. We are analyzing how this transformation interacts with the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is another complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) (where Q is another complex constant) is done at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for t = T > t_1 depend only on M, not on S or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on S, Q, and M. The sequence of transformations implemented through \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) affects the trajectory leading to a final state that is influenced by each of these parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
