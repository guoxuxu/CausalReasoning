  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, representing circular motion with unit radius and angular velocity of 1 radian per unit time. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), particularly focusing on the Laplace transform for different values of the complex variable s.\n\nUsing the computed Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its effect in the Laplace domain given no additional interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the unique properties of the Laplace transform and its ability to encode complete information about the original function under conditions where it converges, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) does allow for the recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
