  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nWould applying a differentiation operation on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before performing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) yield the same result as performing \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) first and then multiplying by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the properties of the Fourier Transform, differentiating a signal in the time domain corresponds to multiplying its transform by \\\\(-i\\\\omega\\\\) in the frequency domain. Therefore, the order of these operations does not alter the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "differentiation operation → change in x(t); differentiation operation → change in y(t); change in x(t) → change in Z(ω); change in y(t) → change in Z(ω); change in Z(ω) → multiplication by -iω; performing F → change in Z(ω)"
