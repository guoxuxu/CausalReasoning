  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, and it evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. Analyze the scenario where a Laplace transform, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(s)) \\\\), is applied, modifying the system's behaviour.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally identify whether the initial state was transformed by a Laplace transform, an inverse transform, or both, based solely on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interactions between the Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms and their nontrivial effects on the system's dynamics, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached by different combinations of these transforms. It is thereby not feasible to uniquely determine the original transformations used from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
