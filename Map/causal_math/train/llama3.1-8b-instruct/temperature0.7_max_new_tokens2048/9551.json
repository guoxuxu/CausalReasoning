  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of this transformation is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of different transformations, first \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\), means that the state at time T > t_1 will depend on both transformations. Each contributes exponentially with a different scaling factor to the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\), thus affecting the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in a compound manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
