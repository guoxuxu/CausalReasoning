  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T: f(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The causal relationship of this transformation in signal processing contexts (Laplace Transform) is studied.\n\nIf a convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention after performing the Laplace Transform on \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), does this affect the frequency domain result independently of the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution operation in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. Thus, the nature of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) distinctly influences the resulting transformed function as the multiplication depends on the transformed versions of both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), demonstrating dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s → T; f(t) → T; g(t) → Convolution; T → Frequency Domain; f(t) → e^at; Convolution → Independent of f(t)"
