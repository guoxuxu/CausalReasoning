  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t according to the integral transform \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with K(s) being a complex kernel function. The initial condition at t = 0 is \\\\(z_0\\\\). An intervention function \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine the exact time \\\\(t_1\\\\) when the intervention was applied, and the specific characteristics of the kernel function K(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of intervention timings and kernel function characteristics due to the complex interactions and transformations over the interval. Hence, these parameters cannot be uniquely identified only from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
