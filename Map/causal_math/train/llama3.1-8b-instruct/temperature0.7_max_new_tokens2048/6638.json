  "Problem": "Consider the impact of applying a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t)\\\\), resulting in \\\\( G(w) \\\\), and then investigating how this transform influences solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix. The situation explores the connection between the manipulation of function domains using integral transformations and their effect on dynamical system evolution.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) be reconstructed accurately by observing the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of the system at time T, assuming no other information about the Fourier transform is available?",
  "Explanation": "Because the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) influenced by \\\\( G(w) \\\\) encapsulates a complex transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), multiple potential functions could lead to the same or similar system states at time T. Without explicit details of \\\\( G(w) \\\\) or additional constraints, exact reconstruction of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
