  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature distribution over a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal conductivity. Study the effect of a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution, especially when analyzing the system's response to external heat sources.\n\nGiven the Fourier-transformed temperature distribution \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) at T, can we conclusively determine if the thermal conductivity was altered during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The information provided by the transformed endpoint \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) alone is insufficient to ascertain whether an intervention (like changing k) occurred, as multiple scenarios (including a constant k throughout) could lead to similar transformed endpoint distributions under different initial or intermediate conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
