  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dv}{dt} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + iBz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + iBz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial state. Even though both segments are linear, the interaction of \\\\( C \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) (due to non-commutativity of matrix multiplication) will produce a fundamentally different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
