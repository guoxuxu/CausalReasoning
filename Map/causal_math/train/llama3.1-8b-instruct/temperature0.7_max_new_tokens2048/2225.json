  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to the system, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = U(s) \\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} \\) is applied to the initial condition \\( u(0) \\) and then allowed to evolve according to its differential equation without further intervention, will \\( U(s) \\) at some point \\( s \\) represent an unchanged relationship from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( U(s) \\) under the linear operator \\( L \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform linearly transforms the function \\( u(t) \\) into \\( U(s) \\) without altering the nature of the relationship imposed by the linear operator \\( L \\). The transform's linearity ensures that the dynamics governed by \\( L \\) are preserved in the transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
