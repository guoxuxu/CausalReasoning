  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega \\tau}z(\\tau)d\\tau\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be exactly reconstructed at any time \\\\(t\\\\) from the transformed function \\\\(T(z)\\\\) without additional information or reversions?",
  "Explanation": "The process of transformation by \\\\(T\\\\) involves integration that typically loses some phase information from the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), making precise reconstruction of the original function impossible without further information about initial phases or additional transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
