  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) with D being a constant matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(x) = Ux \\\\) at time t = 0, where U is a unitary matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or combinations of interventions due to the properties of unitary matrices. The operations might preserve certain geometric features but change others, creating ambiguities about the intervening transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
