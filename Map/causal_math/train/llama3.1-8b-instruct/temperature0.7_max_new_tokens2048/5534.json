  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) to this function and its inverse scenarios.\n\nBased solely on the Laplace transformed output \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), can we determine the precise form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information about the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) arises specifically from \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), but without knowing \\\\( a \\\\), multiple original functions corresponding to different values of \\\\( a \\\\) (even nonzero imaginary parts) could theoretically yield the same form of transformed function. Thus, exact inference of \\\\( a \\\\) is necessary to reverse-engineer \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
