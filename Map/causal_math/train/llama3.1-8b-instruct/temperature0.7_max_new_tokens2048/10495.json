  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) being transformed via a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), yielding a frequency domain representation. Analyze the impact of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined as \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) on the original time-domain signal.\n\nIf an intervention occurs where an additional function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier Transform be a simple addition of the Fourier Transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of the sum of two functions is the sum of their Fourier Transforms (linearity of the Fourier Transform). Hence, adding \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then transforming the result will simply add the Fourier Transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to that of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
