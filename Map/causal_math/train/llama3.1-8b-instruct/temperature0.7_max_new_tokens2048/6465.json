  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We investigate the causal effects of operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and their expression through the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z(t) + ce^{-dt} \\\\) (where c and d are constants) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, will \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a later time T reflect the addition of \\\\( ce^{-dt} \\\\) exactly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by adding a decaying exponential, altering the original function. The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), being a Laplace transform, will reflect this addition, but the result won't be just an addition of constants but will involve integration of the exponential modified by \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
