  "Problem": "Consider a linear system subject to the equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where D is a constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of applying the transformation \\( T(x) = Lx \\) where \\( L \\) is a linear map represented by a constant matrix, and examining the behavior over a duration \\( t \\).\n\nIf a new transformation \\( U(x) = Mx \\) (where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\( t_1 \\), will the state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( L \\) or \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by the initial transformation \\( L \\), the system dynamics \\( D \\), and the intervention \\( M \\). Both \\( L \\) and \\( M \\) affect how the state evolves from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), introducing composite effects that vary depending on their interplay with \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
