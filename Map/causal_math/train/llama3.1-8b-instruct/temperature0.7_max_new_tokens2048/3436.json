  "Problem": "We consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) that maps complex numbers to complex functions, given by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function. We investigate the impact of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and examine the causal effects in the Laplace transform domain.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\\\( z(s) \\\\), can we ascertain the sequence or specifics of interventions (\\\\( h(t) \\\\) and/or \\\\( j(t) \\\\)) used by observing only the transform values?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature or sequence of the interventions merely from the end-state Laplace transform \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is fraught with ambiguity. Interactions between different interventions, such as polynomial multiplication and exponential decay, create a complex transform landscape that cannot unambiguously reveal specific past interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
