  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where \\( M \\) is a constant complex matrix. An operator \\( T \\) that transforms \\( z(t) \\) is defined as \\( Tz = e^{Nt}z \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\( Tz \\) is applied to a complex vector \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The action of \\( Tz \\) modifies the initial state through the transformation \\( e^{Nt} \\). Depending on the relationship between \\( N \\) and \\( M \\), especially if \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) do not commute, the trajectory of the system will deviate from the one that would be observed if \\( z_0 \\) had been evolved directly under \\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\). Thus, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) will generally be different.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
