  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where c is a speed constant. Study the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t,x)) \\\\) on the spatial variable.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state at time T, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the initial state \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) having known no interventions were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform in the context of the wave equation is reversible due to its properties under linear time-invariant systems. Given \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\), we can apply the inverse Fourier transform and use the evolution laws of the wave components to reconstruct \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
