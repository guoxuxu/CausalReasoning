  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(t, y(t)) = \\\\int_0^T k(t, s) y(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a function of time evolved from initial conditions under some autonomous differential equation. We test causal reasoning about the impact of modifying the kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\), can the exact sequence of interventions (changes in the kernel function) applied between t = 0 and T be definitively determined?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( g(T, y(T)) \\\\) could potentially be achieved through various sequences of kernel function modifications, combined with the effects of the original and modified kernels. Because the transformation involves integration, multiple configurations may result in the same end value, obscuring the precise sequence of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
