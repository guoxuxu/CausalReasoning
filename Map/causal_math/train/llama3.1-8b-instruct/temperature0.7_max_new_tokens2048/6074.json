  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the result from the integral transformation, \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\), is it possible to trace back to the original function form \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) as calculated is an integral manipulation which obscures the original function's form, requiring prior knowledge of the type of transformation applied to reliably deduce \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\). Without this information, the result could feasibly originate from diverse function forms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
