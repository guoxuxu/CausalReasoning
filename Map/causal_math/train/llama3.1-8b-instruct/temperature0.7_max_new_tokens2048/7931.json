  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance Z represented by the complex function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \\\\). We analyze the circuit's response under the Laplace transformation of an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\).\n\nIf a filtering process represented by \\\\( F(s) = s + 2 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a specific time, will the final output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) depend only on the original input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), disregarding the filter's influence?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a filter \\\\( F(s) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the system substantially. The output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) will now be the product of \\\\( X(s) \\\\), \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( F(s) \\\\), thus making the resulting system response dependent on the characteristics of the filter as well as the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
