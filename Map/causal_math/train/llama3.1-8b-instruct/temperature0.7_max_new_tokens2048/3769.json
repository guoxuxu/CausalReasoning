  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\leq 0 \\\\) and then the system evolves without further intervention, will the transformed function at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was transformed at t = T directly?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied initially changes the trajectory of the function. Because \\\\( T \\\\) depends on the integral up to that time, the resulting function at any time t will reflect the accumulated history of the transformation, which is different from directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
