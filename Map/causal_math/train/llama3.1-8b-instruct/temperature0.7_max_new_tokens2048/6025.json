  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, in relation to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T, and \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is computed over this interval, does the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of \\\\( A \\\\), the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces dependency on both matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Thus, the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt} e^{At}z_0 \\\\, dt \\\\) depends on the interaction between \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), not just \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
