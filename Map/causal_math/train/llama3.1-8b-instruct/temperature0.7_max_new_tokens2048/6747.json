  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \\\\), used as a transformation within the context of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). The system investigates how transformations affect the Laplace transform of the function over the variable s.\n\nIf another function transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 g(z) \\\\) is applied post initial transformation at s = 1, effectively altering \\\\( g \\\\) before reapplying \\\\( T \\\\), will the final transform \\\\( T[h](s) \\\\) at s = 2 only depend on the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\) properties under the first transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the new function, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 g(z) \\\\), adds a quadratic factor that changes the behavior and properties of the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\), leading to a different outcome under the Laplace transform. Hence, the resultant \\\\( T[h](s) \\\\) at s = 2 is influenced by both the original and the modified function properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
