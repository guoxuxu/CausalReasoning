  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact of the Laplace Transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) that represents a time-domain signal, specifically focusing on how applying the inverse Laplace Transform affects inference regarding the original function.\n\nObserving the time-domain function resulting from the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we identify with certainty whether the observed changes in the function are solely due to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the unaltered \\\\( f(t) \\\\), distinguishing the specific impacts of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) on the modified function is challenging. The observed time-domain changes could be a result of interactions between \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the filter effects of \\\\( G(s) \\\\), and can't be solely attributed to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without understanding \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
