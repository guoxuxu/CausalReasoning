  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We will explore scenarios using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as an integral transformation \\\\( L(g)(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} g(s) ds \\\\) with constant \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( L(f \\cdot g)(t) = L(e^{(a+b)z})(t) \\\\), can we determine what specific functions were applied (whether \\\\( f \\\\), \\\\( g \\\\), or both), from the result alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given the resultant transformation, the observed effect is an integration that blends the influences of both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) into a single expression, losing information about each specific function's contribution. This ambiguity renders it unfeasible to distinguish between applications of \\\\( f \\\\), \\\\( g \\\\), or both merely from the resultant transformation output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
