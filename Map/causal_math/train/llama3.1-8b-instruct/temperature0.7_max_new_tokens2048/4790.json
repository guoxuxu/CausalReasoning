  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop control system where the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is passed through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is regulated to meet certain performance specifications. We investigate the implications of introducing a disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) modeled by \\\\( D(s) = \\\\frac{5}{s+2} \\\\) on the output.\n\nCan the original input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) be accurately deduced from the observed output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the presence or characteristics of the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) and its influence, attributing changes in \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solely to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) becomes erroneous. The disturbance modifies the output in such a way that cannot be uniquely deconvolved to recover the original input without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
