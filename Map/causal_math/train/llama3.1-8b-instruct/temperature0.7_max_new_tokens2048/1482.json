  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we determine if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) or not?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( h(z) \\\\) uniformly across frequencies, without specific information about the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or baseline measurements of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine whether the modification occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
