  "Problem": "Examine the effects of a complex function transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\(t\\\\) is time. This scenario includes the subsequent application of Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on a complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nCan the presence of periodic properties in Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(z(t))\\\\}\\\\) be used to conclusively determine that the transformed function used was \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While periodic properties in the Laplace transform may suggest the influence of a periodic function like \\\\(e^{it}\\\\), they are not conclusive as other functions displaying periodic behavior could have been used. Without additional information, one cannot uniquely determine that \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) was the transformation applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
