  "Problem": "Imagine examining the relationship between the continuous applications of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the domain of complex functions and its inverse operations with operators involving complex conjugation. Suppose the complex function is defined as \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and the operation under scrutiny is \\\\( g(f(t)) = \\\\overline{f(t)} \\\\), which takes the complex conjugate of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely identify whether any specific interventions (\\\\( h \\\\), \\\\( g \\\\), or both) were applied by only observing the output of the Laplace transform of the function at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of complex function transformations and the Laplace transform, especially involving operations like complex conjugation and squaring, makes it infeasible to backtrack definitively and distinguish what specific transformations were applied. Multiple operational paths can lead to similar or even identical transforms, rendering the identification of specific interventions ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
