  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, with an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and an output \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Let's assume an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is applied where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{bt} \\\\), with another constant \\\\( b \\\\), is applied to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) during its evolution, will the effect exclusively depend on the constant \\\\( a \\\\) from the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and then \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adds complexities from both transformations. The resultant output will depend on both constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), showing how different transformations interact and influence the final system's behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → b; a → y; b → y; g(t) → y; x(t) → y; h(t) → y"
