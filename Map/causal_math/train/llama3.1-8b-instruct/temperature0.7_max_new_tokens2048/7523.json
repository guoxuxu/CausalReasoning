  "Problem": "Consider a controlled heat equation on a metal rod along the x-axis modeled by \\\\(\\\\partial_t u(t, x) = k \\\\partial_{xx} u(t, x) + f(t, x)\\\\), where u represents the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(f(t, x)\\\\) is a heating function that varies with time and position.\n\nIf a new controlled heat input \\\\( g(t, x) = h(x)e^{-t} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a later time t = t_1, will the final temperature profile \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T be independent of the initial function \\\\( f(t, x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature profile \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) results from the superposition of the effects of both the initial and the intervened functions \\\\( f(t, x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\). Since both contribute to the heat distribution over time, the endpoint state depends on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
