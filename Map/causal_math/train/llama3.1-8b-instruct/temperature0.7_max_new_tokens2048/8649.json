  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). This system deals with an input signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over time t, where the output signal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) represents the system's response in the frequency domain.\n\nIf a step function \\\\( f(t) = u(t) \\\\) (unit step function) is input into the system without any modifications to \\\\( L \\\\), will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) yield the standard result \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) for Re(s) > 0?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will indeed yield \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) for Re(s) > 0, since the Laplace Transform of the unit step function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) directly produces this result under the standard operational conditions of the transform without any external alteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "input signal f(t) → Laplace Transform L; Laplace Transform L → system response F(s); f(t) = u(t) → input signal f(t); f(t) = u(t) → system response F(s)"
