  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a matrix representing the linear operator in a complex plane. An operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), with N being another constant matrix, is applied to this system.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and is thereafter left to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T conform to the original trajectory as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the original conditions of the system. The action of \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) changes the initial state depending on the interaction between N and M, which generally results in a trajectory divergent from the original if \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
