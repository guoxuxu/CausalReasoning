  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u + f\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(f\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the force term \\\\(f\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine precisely the sequence and type of transformations (\\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(f)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(u)\\\\), or others) used during the evolution only by analysis of \\\\(u(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear interactions and sensitivity to initial conditions and transformations in the Navier-Stokes equations, similar velocity fields \\\\(u(T)\\\\) can result from various sequences of transformations and perturbations. Identifying specific interventions purely based on the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) is fundamentally challenging, if not impossible, without additional contextual information on the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
