  "Problem": "Consider a control system in which an input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the change induced by a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) where C and D are also constant matrices.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( j(x) = Fe^{Gt}x \\\\) (where F and G are constant matrices) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and B, not on C, D, F, or G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(x) \\\\) adds additional dynamics to the system. Therefore, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on A, B as well as the effects introduced by C, D, F, and G. The overlap in transformations makes the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) a function of all these matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
