  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit described by a linear differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effects of introducing a modified voltage source \\\\( V'(t) = V(t) + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we deduce whether the original voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\) or the modified \\\\( V'(t) \\\\) was used by observing the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) alone at time T does not provide conclusive evidence about whether the additional sinusoidal term was present, especially if any frequency components from \\\\( V(t) \\\\) overlap with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Phase and amplitude information may also be lost over time due to the influence of L and R.",
