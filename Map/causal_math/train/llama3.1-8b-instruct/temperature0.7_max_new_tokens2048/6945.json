  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in a transformed signal \\\\( y(t) = z(t) x(t) \\\\). The signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear operator.\n\nIf the complex function transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied initially to signal \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if the transformation was applied continuously over time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially modifies the signal at the outset and due to the nature of the differential equation, the evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) might not commute with the impact of the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, continuous application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) compared to a single initial application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
