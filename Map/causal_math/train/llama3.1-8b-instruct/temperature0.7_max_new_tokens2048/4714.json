  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nBy examining the function at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine if any transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied during its evolution up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information regarding the application of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not indicate whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied or not, as \\\\( T \\\\) is independent in its application from the standard evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
