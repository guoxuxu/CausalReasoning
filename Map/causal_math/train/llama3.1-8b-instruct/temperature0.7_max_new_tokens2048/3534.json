  "Problem": "Investigate a heat distribution system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\(k\\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial temperature distribution function, \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nBy observing the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at time t > 0, is it possible to uniquely determine whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))\\\\) was applied as the initial condition without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation changes the spatial frequencies in the initial condition, and the subsequent diffusion could yield temperature distributions that potentially mirror those evolved from untransformed initial conditions, especially without precise knowledge of all modal contributions and their phases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
