  "Problem": "In a control system analysis, the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) acts on a state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices. We explore the changes in state space when applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{t+1}z \\\\) at different points in time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t=0 and the system is left to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) until t=T, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{tC}z \\\\) modifies the initial state, changing the system’s trajectory from the outset. Unless C and D are proportional such that their exponentials commute effectively, the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will diverge due to the multiplicative impact of matrix exponential dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
