  "Problem": "Consider the time evolution of a quantum state in the presence of a magnetic field. Let the system be described by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system affected by the magnetic field B, given as \\\\( H = -\\\\gamma \\\\vec{B} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{S} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) being the gyromagnetic ratio and \\\\( \\\\vec{S} \\\\) the spin operator. The transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{-i\\\\theta S_z} \\\\psi \\\\) represents a rotation around the z-axis by an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the rotation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied, the tracing back to the original state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) is ambiguous. The rotation could have altered the initial state in a critical way, making it non-trivial to recover \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) without additional information about the rotation angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).",
