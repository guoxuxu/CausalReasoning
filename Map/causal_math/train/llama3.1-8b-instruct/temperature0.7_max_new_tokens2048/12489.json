  "Problem": "Analyze a control system where the output x is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\), with L and N constant matrices and u a control function. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, on the system dynamics.\n\nGiven \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t=T after evolving under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\), can we identify if the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) on \\\\( x_0 \\\\) might produce a state that is feasible through other initial conditions or system parameters under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\) alone. Therefore, knowing only \\\\( x(T) \\\\) doesn't uniquely confirm the application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
