  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) through different linear transformations \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane, and we consider the effect of transformations on this motion.\n\nAssuming an intervention with another transformation \\\\( U(z) = Cz + d \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are different complex numbers, will the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) only depend upon the initial angular velocity \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( A, b, C, \\\\) or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions modify the trajectory and final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through additional scalings and translations introduced by \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). Hence, the final state is influenced not only by the original motion described by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also by the parameters of \\\\( A, b, C, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
