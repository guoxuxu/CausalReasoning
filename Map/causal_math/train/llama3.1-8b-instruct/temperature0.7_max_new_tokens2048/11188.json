  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state of the system. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is not feasible, as different combinations of matrix exponentials applied at various times can lead to the same final state due to their complex interactions and exponential properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
