  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system when subjected to different kernel transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) leading to a convolution integral \\\\( (u*h)(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(\\\\tau)h(t-\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) and its impact on the output used in signal processing.\n\nKnowing the final Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = U(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\) resulting from the interventions of convolution and a transformation by \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence of operations applied?",
  "Explanation": "While the final Laplace transform form indicates the product of transforms from each operation, it does not reveal the sequence of these transformations or distinguish between direct and intervening actions on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) due to the symmetric property of convolution and multiplication in the Laplace domain. Thus, the exact causal sequence of operations remains indeterminate only from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
