  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) \\\\) defined in a complex plane, and an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to it. Analyze how identifying causal relations in such a context might be impacted by the properties of the function and transformation.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) to \\\\( j(x, y) = k \\\\cdot h(x, y) \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant factor, applied during the transformation, will the outcome of \\\\( T[j](s) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( k \\\\) and the properties of \\\\( T \\\\) or also on details of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though the transformation scales with \\\\( k \\\\), the outcome of \\\\( T[j](s) \\\\) also deeply depends on how \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) (now scaled by \\\\( k \\\\)) interacts with the transformation properties. The specifics of \\\\( h \\\\) like its growth, bounds, or decay rates critically influence the final outcome after applying \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
