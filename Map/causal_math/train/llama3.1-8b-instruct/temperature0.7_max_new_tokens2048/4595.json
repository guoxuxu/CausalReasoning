  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\( g(x) \\) defined on \\([0, \\infty)\\) given by \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\), often referred to as the Laplace Transform. We are investigating the effects of pre-multiplying \\( g(x) \\) by another function \\( h(x) \\), resulting in \\( H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx \\).\n\nIf at a certain point \\( x_1 \\), a new function \\( k(x) = e^{bx} \\) (where \\( b \\) is constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\( H(s) \\) for any \\( s \\) depend only on the original transform \\( G(s) \\) and not on \\( h(x) \\) or \\( k(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( k(x) = e^{bx} \\) introduces additional modifications, making \\( H(s) \\) dependent not only on \\( G(s) \\) but also on both transformation functions \\( h \\) and \\( k \\). The outcome will therefore be adjusted by the shifts introduced by both \\( h \\) and \\( k \\), affecting the Laplace Transform result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
