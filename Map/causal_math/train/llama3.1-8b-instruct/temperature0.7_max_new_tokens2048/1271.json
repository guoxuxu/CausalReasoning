  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined as the solution to the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz + k\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We are investigating scenarios where an integral transformation \\\\(w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied, with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new matrix \\\\(B\\\\) intervenes at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) in the system, modifying the integral to \\\\(w(t) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{sA} z(s) ds + \\\\int_{t_1}^t e^{sB} z(s) ds\\\\), will the outcome \\\\(w(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be exclusively dependent on the original equation of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without influence from matrices \\\\(A\\\\) or \\\\(B\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\(B\\\\) introduces a significant new dynamic in the integral from \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\), which combines with the effects of matrix \\\\(A\\\\) from \\\\(0\\\\) to \\\\(t_1\\\\). Consequently, \\\\(w(T)\\\\) depends on the behaviors of both the differential equation and the matrices \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
