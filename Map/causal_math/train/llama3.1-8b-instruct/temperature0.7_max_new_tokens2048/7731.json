  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a current source I(t) and an impedance Z(s) in the Laplace domain, described by the Laplace transform equation V(s) = I(s)Z(s). We investigate the behavior of voltage V(t) as an exact causal response to the current I(t) through various manipulations involving complex function transformations.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(I) = e^{Ct}I(t) \\\\), with C as a constant, is applied to I(t) before entering the system, will the resultant V(t) be solely functionally dependent on the original I(t) characteristics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(I) \\\\) modifies the input properties by scaling or shifting its frequency components depending on the value of C. Consequently, the resultant V(t) reflects changes influenced by both the original I(t) and the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), compounding effects beyond just the native characteristics of I(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
