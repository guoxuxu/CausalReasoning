  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and then analyzing the resultant complex function.\n\nIf after taking the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), a transformation defined by a functional operator \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will the resultant function only provide information about the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the operator \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifies \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the complex frequency domain, introducing additional dynamics or filtering effects. This modification means that the resultant function encodes information about both the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the applied transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\), not solely \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
