  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\\\) with matrices A and B. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to analyze its properties in the frequency domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is Fourier transformed without any modifications, will the resulting function \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflect solely the characteristics of the matrix A in the exponential term?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) will incorporate transformations influenced by both A and B, not just A. The term \\\\( B \\\\) will shift the phase and magnitude in the frequency domain, hence affecting the spectral characteristics of the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
