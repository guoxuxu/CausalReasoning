  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a set of complex functions \\\\(z(t) = U(t)z_0\\\\), where \\\\(U(t)\\\\) is a unitary operator that evolves the state \\\\(z_0\\\\) over time t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t V(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is another operator.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(W(t)\\\\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the state at \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation pathways could lead to the same observed endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the properties of unitary and integral operators, which could effectively mask the exact effects of \\\\(V(s)\\\\) and \\\\(W(t)\\\\). This overlap in the potential state trajectories makes it impossible to uniquely identify the paths of transformations just from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
