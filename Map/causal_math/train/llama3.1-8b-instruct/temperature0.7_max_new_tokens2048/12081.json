  "Problem": "Let's consider a continuous system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) specifies the system's response behavior. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform on this system, with the Laplace transform defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) = U(s)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the solution \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\) in the Laplace space, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) of the original differential equation without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform method encodes all initial conditions into the transformed equation, and the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\) can be directly inferred from \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\) as \\\\(u(0, x) = \\\\lim_{s \\\\to \\\\infty} sU(s, x)\\\\), leveraging the property of the transform in capturing initial conditions as s approaches infinity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
