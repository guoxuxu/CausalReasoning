  "Problem": "Consider an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) + \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\lambda (t-s)} y(s) ds \\\\), where k and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. This models a system where the rate of change of \\\\( y \\\\) depends on both its current state and a weighted integral of its history.\n\nIf \\\\( y(0) \\\\) is given a particular value and evolves according to the integro-differential equation, will the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time t still satisfy the homogeneous equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} y(t) = -ky(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the integral term involving the history of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) implies that the response of the system is not merely proportional to its current state but also influenced significantly by its past states. This dependency alters the dynamics defined solely by \\\\( -ky(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
