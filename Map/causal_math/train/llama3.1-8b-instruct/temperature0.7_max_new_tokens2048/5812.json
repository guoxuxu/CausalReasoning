  "Problem": "Consider the system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) to this system and studying its evolution.\n\nCan we precisely determine the nature of the intervention (i.e., the matrix \\\\( S \\\\)) applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by analyzing the end effect on the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for a given \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities of interactions within matrix transformations and scaling effects, various interventions can lead to similar alterations in the Laplace Transform outcome, making it difficult to uniquely identify the exact nature of \\\\( S \\\\) used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
