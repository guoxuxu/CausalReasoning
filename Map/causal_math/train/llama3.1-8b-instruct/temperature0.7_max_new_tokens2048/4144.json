  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nHaving knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely ascertain the presence and specific times of intervention by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both, based only on the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it is challenging to decode specifically whether interventions by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both, were applied at particular times without additional information. The transformations associated with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) along with the effect of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) contribute multiplicatively, resulting in an endpoint that could feasibly arise from myriad combinations of these influences and their application timings.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
