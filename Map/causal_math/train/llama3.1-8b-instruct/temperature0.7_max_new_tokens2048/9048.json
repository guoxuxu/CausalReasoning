  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\\\) where C is a contour in the complex plane and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function. Analyze the impact of changing the contour C to another contour C' in the complex plane.\n\nCan we conclusively determine what transformations or contour changes (from C to C' or vice versa) occurred given the knowledge of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( F(z) \\\\), multiple transformation sequences involving different contours or function modifications can potentially lead to the same result due to complex integration properties and dependencies on path-specific singularities and growth conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
