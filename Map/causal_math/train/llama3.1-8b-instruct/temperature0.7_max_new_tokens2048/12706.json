  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u + \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t} e^{-\\\\alpha(t-s)}u(s)ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) are constants. The behavior of the system is analyzed when subject to transformations using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nIf an inverse Laplace transform is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the original differential equation without influence from the initial Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an inverse Laplace transform as an intervention would attempt to revert the modifications imposed by the initial Laplace transform but the intervening dynamic equation still integrates the modified state up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) would be affected by both the initial Laplace transform and the subsequent inverse transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
