  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nIf an intervention using the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied at some time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the resulting function value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( T \\\\) is applied as an intervention, the resulting transformed function up to time T significantly depends on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\), involving the integration with \\\\( e^{iB\\\\tau} \\\\), introduces dependency on \\\\( B \\\\) and modifies how \\\\( z \\\\) evolves post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
