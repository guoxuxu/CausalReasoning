  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We are exploring the impact of performing a Fourier transform on this function over time and analyzing the behavior with subsequent Laplace transforms.\n\nGiven just the final Laplace transform result of a function evolved by applying both a Fourier and a Laplace transform, can we determine the specific sequence of transformations (i.e., Fourier first, then Laplace) used on \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and Fourier transform, while related, offer cumulative integral transformations that mask the sequence of their applications when only the final result is known. Sorting out the specific sequence applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the Laplace domain alone, without other data, is not feasible due to their integral nature and conversion into the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
