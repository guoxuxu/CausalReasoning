  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the state is evolved using a linear time-invariant differential equation described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The study will explore the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and it then evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transformed state \\\\( F(x)(T) \\\\) at t = T simulate the original evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation changes the domain from time to frequency, capturing different information than the time dynamics governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\). Hence, the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) post-transformation will not mirror the original as the transformation involves integral properties that fundamentally alter the representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
