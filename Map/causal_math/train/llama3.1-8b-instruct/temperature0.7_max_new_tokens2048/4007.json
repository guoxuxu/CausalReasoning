  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az + B} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants. The model investigates the impact of the linear transformation and the complex function on a vector space over a field of complex numbers.\n\nIf the vector \\\\( v \\\\) is manipulated via another linear transformation \\\\( N \\\\) at a certain point and then the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied, is the resulting vector solely dependent on the last transformation \\\\( N \\\\) irrespective of the initial application of \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) influence the final outcome. Even with the intervention of \\\\( N \\\\), the initial application of \\\\( M \\\\) influences the state prior to the intervention, and thus the overall transformation encompasses the effects of both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), compounded by the nonlinear action of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
