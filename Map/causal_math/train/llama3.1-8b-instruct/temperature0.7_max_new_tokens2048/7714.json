  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing the output of a system where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(t-\\\\tau)A}Bu(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input signal with B a constant matrix and A a linear operator. Analyze the impact of applying a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) to the signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from 0 to T without the knowledge of Laplace transform application?",
  "Explanation": "The reconstruction of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) directly, without additional information such as the application of a Laplace transform, typically requires inverse operations that are not uniquely solvable just with the final output, owing to the integral transformation nature of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
