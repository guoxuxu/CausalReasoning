  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent time-dependent real functions. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform on this function and then interpreting the inverse transform without and with interventions.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the transformed function is evolved using the linear operator \\\\( D(s) = s^2 + s + 1 \\\\), will the inverse Laplace transform yield the same function as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) upon applying the same operator in the time domain?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into its Laplace form and modifying it through \\\\( D(s) \\\\) leads to changes in frequency components (root characteristics in the s-domain). Direct application of a differential operator in the time domain generally does not equate with the sequence: transform, modify in s-domain, and inverse transform, because these transformations alter the essential characteristics of the function differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
