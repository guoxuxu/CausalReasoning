  "Problem": "Consider a series of kinematic equations \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t) = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\vec{a}t^2\\\\) in a physics simulation space, where \\\\(\\\\vec{a}\\\\) is the acceleration vector. Analyze how applying a transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that scales and rotates the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) affects the position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) over time.\n\nIf the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves under the kinematic equations without further intervention, will the position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under the original equations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) changes the initial velocity, which directly influences the linear term of the position equation. This modified initial velocity results in a different trajectory, leading to a position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) at time T that differs from the trajectory without applying \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
