  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The differential equation governing the dynamics is \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\lambda z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). When this new initial condition evolves, the solution to the differential equation is \\\\( z(t) = e^{-i\\\\lambda t}e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) rather than \\\\( e^{-i\\\\lambda t}z_0 \\\\), representing a phase shift introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
