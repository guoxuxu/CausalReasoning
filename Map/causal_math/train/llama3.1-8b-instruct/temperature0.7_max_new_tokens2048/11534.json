  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in complex domain as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a mapping function given by \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\). We explore the impact of their composition \\\\( h(z) = g(f(z)) \\\\) and transformations related to the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) over a contour C, can we deduce the exact shape and nature of the contour C without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The value of an integral in the complex plane may not uniquely identify the contour, especially when multiple contours could encompass poles or avoid them similarly. Specific additional information about the residues enclosed by the contour is required.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
