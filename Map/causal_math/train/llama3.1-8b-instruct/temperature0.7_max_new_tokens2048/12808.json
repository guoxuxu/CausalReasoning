  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), typically representing a harmonic oscillator. We study the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial velocity condition \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf the initial velocity \\\\( v_0 \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform \\\\( F(v_0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\) without further intervention, will the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t be the same as if the original \\\\( v_0 \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial velocity \\\\( v_0 \\\\) alters the frequency components of the system's initial state, potentially impacting how the displacement evolves over time according to the system equation. Variations in these components due to the transform will result in a different displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
