  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) in which \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing a trajectory in the complex plane. We are given that the trajectory evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We also consider the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is another complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, any transformations due to \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions in such a way that the extracted \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined without knowing B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
