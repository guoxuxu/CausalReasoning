  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is a function in time. This model explores the transformation of x(t) into z(x) over a period T, focusing on its impact in a linear system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Bx \\\\).\n\nIf x(t) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Bx \\\\) over a period T starting from an initial condition x(0), will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) be affected by the specific choice of the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(x) \\\\) involves the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which depends on the matrix A. The nature of A influences how the function x(t) is transformed during the integration, impacting the resulting value of \\\\( z(x) \\\\). Different choices of A yield different transformations, thus affecting \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
