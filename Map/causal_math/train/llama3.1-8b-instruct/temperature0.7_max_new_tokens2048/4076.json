  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. An integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\) is applied to study its properties over time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the final observation \\( z(T) \\), can we determine specifically whether the transformation \\( T(z) \\) or the intervention \\( P(z) \\) was applied, based solely on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "From \\( z(T) \\) alone, it is not possible to disentangle the effects or even the presence of \\( T(z) \\) versus \\( P(z) \\). The trajectories leading to \\( z(T) \\) could be achieved by a variety of combinations of \\( c \\) and \\( T(z) \\), without a unique traceable path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
