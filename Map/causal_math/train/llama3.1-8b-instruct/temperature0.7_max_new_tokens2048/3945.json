  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nIf \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) is applied to \\( z_0 = e^{i0} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and thereafter \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve naturally without intervention, will \\( z(T) = (e^{iT})^2 \\) be the same as \\( z(T) = e^{i2T} \\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) sets \\( z_0 \\) to 1, thus \\( z(T) = (e^{iT})^2 = e^{i2T} \\), which is the same result as if \\( z(t) \\) had been naturally evolving from a squared initial condition due to \\( z_0^2 = 1^2 = 1 \\). The transformation does not alter the behavior of the evolution under natural circumstances.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
