  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), with a control input \\\\( u \\\\). Here, A is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics and B is the control matrix. An operator applies a transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where C is another constant matrix determining a specific kind of state transformation.\n\nKnowing the final system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately reverse-engineer and determine whether transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) and specific control interventions were applied throughout the timeline given only the matrices A, B, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap of exponential transformations and control influences involving matrices A, B, C, and D makes it challenging to uniquely identify both the transformations and the specific control actions used throughout the evolution of the system, especially if not all parameters (like \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
