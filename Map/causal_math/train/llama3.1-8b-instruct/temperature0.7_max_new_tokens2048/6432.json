  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex vector. The function is subject to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}w(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after applying the transformations \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\) and \\\\( U[v(t)] \\\\), can we specifically attribute the resultant condition to either \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\), \\\\( U[v(t)] \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities introduced by the interplay and potential non-commutativity between the matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) in their respective transformations, it is impractical to determine distinctly whether one or both transformations influenced the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional data on the transformation application sequence and parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
