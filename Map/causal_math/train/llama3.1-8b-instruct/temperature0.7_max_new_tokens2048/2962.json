  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the temperature distribution over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the influence of a spatial transformation given by \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants, on this temperature distribution.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution at \\\\(t = T\\\\), is it possible to exactly trace back the original spatial coordinates without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information on the application of the spatial transformation \\\\(g(x)\\\\), it's impossible to accurately deduce the original spatial configuration of the rod as the transformation could have fundamentally altered the initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
