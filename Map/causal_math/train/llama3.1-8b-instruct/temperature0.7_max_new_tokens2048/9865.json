  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without intervention, will the function behave the same way as if only \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) was applied from the start?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the representation of the function from time domain to frequency domain, changing its interpretation and potentially affecting subsequent analyses or transformations. Thus, the behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) post-transformation will be different in the frequency domain than just evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
