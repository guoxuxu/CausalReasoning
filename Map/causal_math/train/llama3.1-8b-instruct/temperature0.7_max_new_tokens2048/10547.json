  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) being a function evolving under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. Consider the role of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and how it interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nAssume an intervention where a matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is introduced modifying the system to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = (P+Q)x \\\\) at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Does the spectrum \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) solely depend on the original matrix \\\\( P \\\\) regardless of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) affects the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), altering the linear structure and potentially the stability and frequency content of the system. Thus, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) reflects the effects of both \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\), showing dependencies on the nature of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
