  "Problem": "Analyze a control system where the output x is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\), with L and N constant matrices and u a control function. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, on the system dynamics.\n\nKnowing the system reached a specific state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after some transformations were applied, is it possible to ascertain the exact nature and sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( X(x) \\\\), or both) applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences or types of transformations (integration involving different matrices M and Q) could yield the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The overlapping effects and non-uniqueness in integral transformation outcomes under non-commutative conditions make it impossible to precisely determine the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
