  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is defined as the Laplace transform. We examine the effects this transformation has on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to convert it into the frequency domain, does the action of transforming back from the frequency domain to the time domain using the inverse Laplace transform without any other intervention result in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are designed to be inverse operations. Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse, provided all conditions for the transforms are met and there is no other intervention, should indeed return the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
