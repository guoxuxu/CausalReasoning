  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of a linear resistor and a capacitor. The charging of the capacitor over time t is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}(V-V_0)\\\\), where V is the voltage across the capacitor, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and \\\\(V_0\\\\) is the constant input voltage. To analyze the system, we explore the influence of a sinusoidal signal \\\\(A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) superimposed on the input voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\).\n\nKnowing only the final voltage \\\\(V(T)\\\\) and that there was an intervention in resistance R at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), can we accurately distinguish whether the original input was constant \\\\(V_0\\\\) or had the sinusoidal signal added?",
  "Explanation": "Without measuring or knowing the specific details of the sinusoidal input and the exact modifications in resistance, the final state \\\\(V(T)\\\\) can result from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions. The overlap in potential voltage profiles under different scenarios renders accurate backward causality determination impractical.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
