  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is applied to transform a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) via the integral \\( G(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{az} g(z) \\, dz \\). The parameter \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number, and the transformation explores how changes in \\\\( a \\\\) affect the outcome of the integral transformation.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at some time during the transformation, while keeping \\\\( a \\\\) constant, will the resulting \\\\( G(a) \\\\) be independent of the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the internal structure of the integral by altering the function from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Since the outcome depends directly on the function being integrated, the resultant \\\\( G(a) \\\\) will reflect the modification to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) rather than staying consistent with the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
