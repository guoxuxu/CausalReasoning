  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint under \\\\( f^2(z) \\\\) after application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we precisely determine both the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( t \\\\) used in \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The quadratic nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the rotational transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduce ambiguities in determining both the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the specific intervention used. Multiple combinations of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
