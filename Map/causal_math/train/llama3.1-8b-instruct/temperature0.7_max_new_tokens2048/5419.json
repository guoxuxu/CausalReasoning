  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\), where A and B are constants and \\\\(\\\\overline{z}\\\\) represents the complex conjugate of z. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 remain unaffected by the previous transformations applications of B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial transformation \\\\( e^{Ct}z \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( e^{Dt}z \\\\) contribute to changes in the trajectory of z. These transformations potentially influence the impact of both A and B in the differential equation, cumulatively affecting the final state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
