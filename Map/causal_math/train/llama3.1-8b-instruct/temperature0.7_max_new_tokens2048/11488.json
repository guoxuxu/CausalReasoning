  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) evolving over time governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) represent real and imaginary components respectively. A Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ z(t) \\} = Z(s) \\) is applied to examine the system in the s-domain.\n\nCan the nature of interventions on \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) be clearly deduced from \\( Z(s) \\) for some \\( s \\) without knowing the form of the applied changes via time?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( Z(s) \\), while some characteristics of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) can be estimated, the specific details or type of interventions applied through time cannot be precisely identified due to the potential variety of modifications that could yield similar transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
