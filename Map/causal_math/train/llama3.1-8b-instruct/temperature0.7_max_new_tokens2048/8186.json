  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a linear operator. We examine the role of a transformation initiated by \\(\\Gamma(z) = Qz\\), \\(Q\\) being another linear operator, applied at an initial time \\(t = 0\\).\n\nAfter observing \\(z(T)\\) following the evolution \\(t = 0\\) to \\(T\\), can we determine whether the transformation \\(\\Gamma(z)\\) was applied at the initial time without knowing \\(Q\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of \\(Q\\) or confirmation of its application, tracing back to the exact initial conditions \\(z_0\\) or \\(Qz_0\\) is ambiguous. The observed state \\(z(T)\\) could result from several different configurations of initial states and transformations, especially if \\(Q\\) and \\(M\\) are not explicitly known or characterized.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
