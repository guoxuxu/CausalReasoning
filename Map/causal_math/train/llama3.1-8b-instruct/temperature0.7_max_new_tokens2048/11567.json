  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the system's state at time t. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform, designated as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), a complex function in the s-domain.\n\nIf a change is deliberately introduced in the s-domain representation, \\\\( Z'(s) = Z(s) + e^{-as} \\\\) (where a is a constant), to modify the system's state, will this intervention in the s-domain translate accurately to a predictable change in the time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening in the s-domain by modifying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) does result in a corresponding change in the time-domain representation due to the inverse Laplace transform. However, predicting the exact effect on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to time T can be complex due not only to the transform properties but to how changes interact with the original system's dynamics, potential non-linearities, or multiple valid inverse transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
