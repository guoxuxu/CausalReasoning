  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and we apply a Fourier transform to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\) to convert it to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}_t = -k\\\\omega^2\\\\hat{u}\\\\). We are interested in analyzing how transformations in the frequency domain using a function \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2 t}\\\\hat{u} \\\\) affect the system's behavior over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original frequency domain representation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely recover the initial function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0 \\\\). The action of \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) introduces an additional decay factor that modifies the evolution of the temperature distribution, masking the original conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
