  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) which acts on a vector space and is defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\. The system evaluates the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the system dynamics when subjected to another transformation \\\\( S(x) = Nx \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, at different instances.\n\nWithout intervening with any additional transformations, can we infer the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( x(t) \\\\), assuming only \\\\( M \\\\) influenced the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformation was solely dictated by \\\\( M \\\\) and was linear, inverting \\\\( M \\\\) (provided it is invertible) can uniquely trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from any future state assuming no external influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
