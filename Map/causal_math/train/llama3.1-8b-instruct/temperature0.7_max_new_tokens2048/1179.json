  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving via the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Qz \\\\), with Q being a complex constant. Analysis includes the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\), where P is also a complex constant, representing an operational transformation.\n\nAssuming a new intervention \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) where R is a complex constant is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T>t_1 solely depend on Q and not on P or R?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) means the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the transformations due to P and R as well as the inherent evolution due to Q. The interplay between these complex exponentials means all will impact the eventual state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
