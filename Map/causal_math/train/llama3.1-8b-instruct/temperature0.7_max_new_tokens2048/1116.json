  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nCan the application of any potential filters like \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be determined unequivocally by analyzing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Since different combinations of filters can yield similar or even identical transformations in the frequency domain, it is not possible to uniquely determine which specific filters were applied just by examining the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The conversion is not bijective, allowing for multiple potential filter configurations producing the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
