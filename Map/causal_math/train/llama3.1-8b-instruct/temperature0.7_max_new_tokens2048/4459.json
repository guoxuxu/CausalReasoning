  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}x \\\\) where C is a complex function of a vector \\\\( x \\\\), and A is a constant matrix. The evolution of the function over time illustrates how x migrates through the transformation dictated by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and complex modulation by C.\n\nIf an intervention with a new linear operator \\\\( D \\\\) applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the dynamics to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + Dz\\\\), will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the function C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the linear operator D adds to the complexity, but the system’s trajectory up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influenced by C still impacts the state at T. As such, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) undoubtedly depends on both C and D alongside A, due to their cumulative influence leading up to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
