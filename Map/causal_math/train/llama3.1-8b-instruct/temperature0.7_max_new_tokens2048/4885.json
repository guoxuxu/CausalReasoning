  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The function undergoes a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to the system equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T match the state at t = T if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under the original system equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by scaling and possibly rotating the vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\), resulting in different trajectories for x and y. The system's evolution will be differently influenced by the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), leading to a deviation in x(t) and y(t) at any time T from an unaltered preliminary trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
