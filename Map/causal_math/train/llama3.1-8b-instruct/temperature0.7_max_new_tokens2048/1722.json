  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\) where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) is a function of space and time. An integral transformation particularly the Fourier transform \\\\(F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\) is considered to observe the behavior of the system in the frequency domain over time.\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing if any transformations or initial conditions were modified before time evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the Fourier transform is linear and invertible under ideal conditions, practical limitations such as loss of information, non-linearity of real-world systems, or unknown initial modifications prevent us from exactly determining \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) based solely on \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
