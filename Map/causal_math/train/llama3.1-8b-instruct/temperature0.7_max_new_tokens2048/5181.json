  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{wt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Study the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, and T is the upper limit of integration.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally from time 0 to T under its own intrinsic dynamics, will applying \\\\( G(z) \\\\) after it fully evolves reflect the effects of the complex exponential growth dictated solely by \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} e^{wt} dt \\\\) simplifies to \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{(w-s)t} dt \\\\), inherently reflecting the natural dynamics of the system under \\\\( w \\\\), as the transformation is directly computed on the function evolving under its intrinsic characteristics without external manipulation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
