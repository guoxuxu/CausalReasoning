  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the effects of applying the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T if the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, the transformations introduced by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) might have altered the initial conditions significantly, especially if C influences the amplitude and phase components of the complex vector. This makes retrieving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
