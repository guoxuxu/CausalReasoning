  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iw_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( w_0 \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time. This function is subject to transformations by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which is an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using a different integral transform \\\\( M \\\\) with kernel \\\\( M(t, s) \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the final form of the function at time T depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and not on the interventions performed?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional transform \\\\( M \\\\) as an intervention modifies the trajectory of the function progression, depending on the properties of \\\\( M(t, s) \\\\). The resulting function at time T is influenced by both the original function and the impacts of each transform, making the output depend on all applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
