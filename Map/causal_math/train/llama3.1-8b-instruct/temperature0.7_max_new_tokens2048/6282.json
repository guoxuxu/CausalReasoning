  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) on a bounded domain with initial displacement given by \\\\(u(x,0) = f(x)\\\\) and a Fourier transform applied to the displacement as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x)dx\\\\). We consider how interventions via changes in boundary conditions or initial conditions affect the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the wave profile \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at some time t, can we deduce the exact initial displacement \\\\(f(x)\\\\) without knowing any change was applied to the boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion from \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) to \\\\(f(x)\\\\) relies critically on the boundary conditions applied along with knowing there were no changes or interventions. Without specific information on boundary conditions or any additional modifications, multiple initial profiles could result in the same wave profile at time t due to symmetries and the undetermined phase induced by the cosine term in the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
