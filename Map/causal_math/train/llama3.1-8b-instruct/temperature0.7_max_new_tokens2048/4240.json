  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) which describes a point moving on the unit circle in the complex plane over time t. We explore the response of the system under an integral transformation described by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the end result of the transformation \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we determine the specific timing and nature of any interventions (like phase shifts) applied during the integration?",
  "Explanation": "The final integrated result \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) may reflect the cumulative impact of the original function and any interventions, but due to the overarching integration process, specific details about interventions (such as timing or exact nature) cannot be uniquely identified from the end result alone due to possible overlapping effects and the continuous nature of integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
