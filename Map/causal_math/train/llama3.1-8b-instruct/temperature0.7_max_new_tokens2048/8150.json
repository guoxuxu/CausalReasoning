  "Problem": "Examine the dynamic system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) dx \\\\) applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nCan the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be uniquely determined from the evolved Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) without knowing the specific operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The unique inversion of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) to find \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) requires knowledge of L, as different operators can modify how the state evolves in the transformed domain. Without this, multiple different initial conditions could result in the same observed state at T under different operators.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
