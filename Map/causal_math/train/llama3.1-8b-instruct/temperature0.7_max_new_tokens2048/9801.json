  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied to the function at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting function at t = T simply be the initial function integrated with \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\) up to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) modifies the nature of the original function by integrating it with \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\), which significantly alters its properties and results. This new function is not merely \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) integrated with \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\); it is a fundamentally different function resulting from the combination of the two influences over the interval from 0 to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
