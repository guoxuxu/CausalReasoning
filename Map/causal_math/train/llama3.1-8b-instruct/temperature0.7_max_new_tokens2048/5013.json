  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system under a specific transformation, where \\( z(t) \\) represents a complex function of time \\( t \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), with \\( \\omega \\) constant. The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is utilized to study the system's frequency domain characteristics.\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is computed without any modification to \\( z(t) \\), will the Laplace transform domain reflect simple oscillatory behavior of \\( z_0 \\) across all frequencies?",
  "Explanation": "The direct computation of \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) reveals a pole at \\( s = -i\\omega \\), corresponding precisely to the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the original oscillation of \\( z_0 \\). This reflects the undisturbed oscillatory nature of \\( z_0 \\) in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
