  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int K(x,y,t) u(y,t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( S(u) = \\\\int M(x,y,t)u(y,t) dy \\\\) (where M is another kernel function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation, making the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent on L, K, and M. The functional form and interaction of these kernels can significantly affect the outcome, altering the trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
