  "Problem": "Assume the behavior of a complex system can be modeled by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state in complex space, and A and C are constant complex matrices. Manipulations on the system are achieved by applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Dze^{Bt}\\\\), where D and B are also constant complex matrices.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and lets the system evolve according to \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T = T be same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was evolved directly to T = T under \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\(Dz_0\\\\). The subsequent evolution is based on this modified state, leading to a solution \\\\(Ce^{AT}(Dz_0)\\\\), which is generally not equal to \\\\(Ce^{AT}z_0\\\\) unless D commutes with C and A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
