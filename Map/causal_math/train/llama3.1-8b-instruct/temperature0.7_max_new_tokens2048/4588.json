  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x)e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is a spatial profile and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of oscillation. The function represents a wave-like solution to the wave equation. We apply a Fourier transform in time, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), to derive frequency domain characteristics and investigate potential changes induced by a spatial transformation \\\\(G(x) = x^2\\\\).\n\nGiven the spatial profile at any time \\\\(t\\\\), can we conclusively determine all applied transformations (initial and intermediate) based solely on the observation of the spatial profile at that time?",
  "Explanation": "Observing the spatial profile at a specific time doesn't provide enough information to backtrack and determine each transformation applied uniquely. Multiple sequences of transformations can lead to the same or indistinguishably similar spatial profiles at a given time, making it impossible to conclusively identify the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
