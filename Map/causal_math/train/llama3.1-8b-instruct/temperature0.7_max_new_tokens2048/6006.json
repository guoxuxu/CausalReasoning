  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nAfter observing \\( T(z) \\) to satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), can we confirm if the original \\( z \\) did also satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The cubic transformation can map a variety of \\( z \\) values that do not originally satisfy \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\) into ones that do. Thus, observing that \\( T(z) \\) satisfies the equation does not guarantee the original \\( z \\) also did.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
