  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to get \\\\( F(s) \\\\), followed by its evolution defined by a complex differential equation without further intervention, will the inverse transformation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at a later time remain an accurate representation of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are linear transformations which preserve the original function under linear operations, assuming no singularity or convergence issues. Given the transformation is properly handled, the evolved function after inverse transformation should coincide with the original function evolved by the same differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
