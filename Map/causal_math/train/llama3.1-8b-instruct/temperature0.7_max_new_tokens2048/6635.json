  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system is subject to an input function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) affecting the system's state. An integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, is used to analyze the behavior over time.\n\nIf an operator modification \\\\( M \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing how the operator \\\\( L \\\\) behaves afterward, will the final state \\\\( U(s) \\\\) for s > t_1 be influenced by both the original system's operator \\\\( L \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's dynamics by altering the differential operator from \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( M \\\\). Therefore, the resulting system behavior and the Laplace transform of the final state \\\\( U(s) \\\\) will depend on both the original and the modified dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
