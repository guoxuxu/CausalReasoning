  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(x(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the impact of altering this system using a transformation defined by the matrix function \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T, is it possible to uniquely identify the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(x) = Sx\\\\), it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) because the transformation could have modified the initial state and trajectory in a non-traceable manner, unless additional information about S or its effects is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
