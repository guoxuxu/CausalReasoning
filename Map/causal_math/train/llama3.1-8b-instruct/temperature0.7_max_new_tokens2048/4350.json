  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nUpon observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) after it has evolved, is it possible to determine the initial function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) uniquely without knowing if the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely derived because the observed \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be modified by the phase and magnitude changes of the complex exponential, verifying its application is crucial.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
