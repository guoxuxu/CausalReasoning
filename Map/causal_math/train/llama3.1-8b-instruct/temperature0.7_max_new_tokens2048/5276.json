  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\) where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + Nu\\\\), with constant matrices M and N and control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\). We explore how this integral transformation affects causal inference in different scenario contexts.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) at some time T, can we exactly determine the nature of the intervention in terms of the input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) or control strategy applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final value of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) aggregates all historical data on the state evolution and control inputs through integration. Due to the many-to-one nature of integration, similar transformations \\\\(h(z)\\\\) might result from different forms or sequences of input \\\\(u(t)\\\\). Thus, specific details about intervention strategies cannot be uniquely deciphered just from the final transformation value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
