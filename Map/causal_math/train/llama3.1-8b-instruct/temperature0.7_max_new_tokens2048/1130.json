  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency in a physical context. The function is then transformed through an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at a specific value of \\\\( s \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( w \\\\) from the outcome without knowing the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) for \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) evaluates to a function of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\). Specifically, it results in \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\), hence from the transformed result, the value of \\\\( w \\\\) can be uniquely determined if \\\\( s \\\\) is known.",
