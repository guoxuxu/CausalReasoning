  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function z on an integral transformation defined by the integral operator T, where \\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\) over a contour \\( \\\\gamma \\) in the complex plane. Here, z is a complex number and \\( f(t) \\) is a function of the complex variable t.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\( T[f](z) \\) for a specific function f(t), can we deduce the specific value of z without other information?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( T[f](z) \\) might not uniquely determine z as different complex values of z might lead to integral values that are difficult to distinguish without additional constraints on z or knowledge of the integration path \\( \\\\gamma \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → T[f](z); f(t) → T[f](z); T[f](z) → specific value of z; f(t) → specific value of z; z → specific value of f(t); T[f](z) → specific value of f(t); specific value of f(t) → specific value of z"
