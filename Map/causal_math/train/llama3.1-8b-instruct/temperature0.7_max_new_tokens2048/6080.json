  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven that the Laplace transform results \\\\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s + \\gamma - i\\omega} \\\\) can we precisely determine the values of both \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) only with this transform?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = -\\gamma + i\\omega \\\\) directly yields both \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The real part of the pole, \\\\( -\\gamma \\\\), and the imaginary part, \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can be distinctly identified, thereby accurately determining both the damping factor and angular frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
