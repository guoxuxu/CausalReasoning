  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a control system operates following a linear equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), with K being a constant coefficient matrix and u representing external control influences. Suppose an experimental transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) is introduced, where A is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) from the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) observed at time t, assuming no knowledge of whether transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) = e^{At}y \\\\) was applied at the beginning, it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( y_0 \\\\). The transformation could have altered \\\\( y_0 \\\\), making different initial states map to the same observed output, particularly if A introduces changes that are not straightforwardly reversible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
