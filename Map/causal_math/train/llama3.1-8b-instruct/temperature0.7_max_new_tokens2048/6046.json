  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of this function is studied under a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at different intervals of time t.\n\nKnowing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0, can we determine if the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to distinguish if the state \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{2i\\\\omega T} \\\\) (corresponding to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) application) resulted from the original or doubly frequent function, as both are feasible outcomes depending on whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
