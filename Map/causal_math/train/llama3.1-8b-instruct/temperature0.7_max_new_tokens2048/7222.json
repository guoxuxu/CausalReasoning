  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. The influence of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z dt \\\\) is considered, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to correctly back-calculate to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the integral might have added components not present in the natural evolution under \\\\( C \\\\), thus altering the state unrecognizably.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
