  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nIf an additional decay function \\( e^{-bt} \\) is applied as an intervention at some \\( t_1 \\), will the ultimate form of \\( z(w) \\) be influenced only by \\( a \\) and not \\( b \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding \\( e^{-bt} \\) at \\( t_1 \\) significantly modifies the decay characteristics of \\( \\phi(t) \\), influencing both the rate and the ultimate spectral form. Thus \\( z(w) \\) will reflect the characteristics derived from both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
