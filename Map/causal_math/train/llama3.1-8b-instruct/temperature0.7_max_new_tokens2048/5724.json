  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. The transformation is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We examine the differential effects of this transformation on the trajectories of points in the complex plane.\n\nBased on the final state at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or some combination) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of transformations with matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) may produce similar or even identical endpoints in the complex plane, due to overlapping effects on the magnitude and phase of complex numbers. Therefore, it's not possible to uniquely determine the interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
