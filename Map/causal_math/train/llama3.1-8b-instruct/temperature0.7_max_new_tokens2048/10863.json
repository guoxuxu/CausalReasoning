  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nIf an intervention altering the system matrix A to a new matrix A' is made at time t = 0, will y(T) for T > 0 be predictable just by knowing y_0 and A' regardless of B?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation to A' changes the dynamic properties of the system, but the matrix B still influences y(t) through the control function u(t). Without knowing how B interacts with u(t), predictive accuracy for y(T) just from A' and y_0 is compromised.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
