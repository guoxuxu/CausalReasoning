  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the real and imaginary parts of the complex plane. We are analyzing the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sz} ds \\\\).\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately determined from the state at t = T when we have no information whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation or the direct function was applied, the resultant can have different origins since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) can modify the initial state in a non-trivial way, making the inversion process non-unique and indeterminable with certainty from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
