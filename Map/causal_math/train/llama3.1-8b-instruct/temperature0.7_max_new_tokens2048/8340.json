  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform applied on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We explore the causal implications of manipulating the function after its transform, by applying a frequency filter function \\\\( F(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed output from the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s)F(s)G(s) \\\\), can we definitively identify the sequence and values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) used in the filters \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) might lead to the same compounded effect in the s-domain, resulting in indistinguishable outputs upon inverse transformation. This ambiguity prevents definitive identification of the specific sequence or values of the filter parameters used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
