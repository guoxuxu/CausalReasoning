  "Problem": "Consider a multi-dimensional complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex initial vector. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any changes, will the transform deterministically reflect properties of matrix \\\\( A \\\\) across all \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is defined as the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a direct exponential function involving matrix \\\\( A \\\\), the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) necessarily encodes the structural attributes of \\\\( A \\\\). The Laplace transform is linear and deterministic, preserving the influence of \\\\( A \\\\) within the transformed domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
