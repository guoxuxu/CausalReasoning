  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in a complex plane, described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. We introduce a transformation given by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, affecting the amplitude and phase of \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, and not knowing the values of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation could alter the amplitude and phase in a way that is indistinguishable from the effects of pure rotational dynamics under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
