  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier transform scenario where a given function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on the domain \\\\( t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) undergoes the transformation defined by \\\\( F(\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(f(t))(\\\\xi) \\\\), which is the Fourier transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The variable \\\\( \\\\xi \\\\) denotes frequency. The effect of a multiplicative modulation by a cosine wave, \\\\( h(t) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\), on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is considered, i.e., the new function becomes \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\cos(\\\\omega_0 t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final Fourier transform \\\\( H(\\\\xi) \\\\), can the specific interventions (modulations by \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\)) be precisely determined just based on the outcome \\\\( H(\\\\xi) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation result \\\\( H(\\\\xi) \\\\) could potentially be realized by various combinations of frequency modulations, making it impossible to uniquely pinpoint whether modulations specifically due to \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\) were applied, especially considering the phenomena of frequency component overlap and translation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
