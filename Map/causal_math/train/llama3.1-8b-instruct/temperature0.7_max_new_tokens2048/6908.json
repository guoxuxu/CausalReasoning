  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nGiven the Fourier spectrum of a modulated function \\\\( F'(\\\\omega) \\\\), can one determine whether the function was indeed modulated, and if so, specifically identify the modulation frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the changes in the spectrum can suggest that some modulation has occurred, without additional information about the original spectrum or the nature of changes, it is challenging to precisely quantify the modulation frequency \\\\( w \\\\) due to the potential for overlapping effects or multiple feasible modulations producing a similar spectral outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
