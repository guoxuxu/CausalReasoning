  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform without any modifications, will the resulting function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) have the same poles as if \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) was transformed separately?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)}\\\\), which has a pole at \\\\(s = a+bi\\\\). This is different from the Laplace transform of \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), which is \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\), having a pole at \\\\(s = a\\\\). The presence of \\\\(b\\\\) introduces an imaginary component affecting the pole's location.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
