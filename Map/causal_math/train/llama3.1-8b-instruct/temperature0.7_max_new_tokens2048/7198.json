  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system operating on a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) describes a path in the complex plane. The system is described by the matrix operator \\\\(L\\\\) such that the transformation is \\\\(w(t) = L[z(t)]\\\\) involving a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). Analyzing the effect of modifications to \\\\(L\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nGiven an observed output \\\\(w(t)\\\\) at a specific time T following a convolution transformation, is it possible to determine the exact original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing the specific kernel \\\\(k(t)\\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\(w(t)\\\\) of a convolution operation depends critically on both the input function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the convolution kernel \\\\(k(t)\\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\(k(t)\\\\), multiple combinations of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(k(t)\\\\) could yield the same output, thus \\\\(z(t)\\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\(w(t)\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
