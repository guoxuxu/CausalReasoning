  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) defined over time, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We investigate the role of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), representing an integral transformation.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original function at time t = 0, exclusively based on the knowledge that the Laplace transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation could alter the initial state of the function in ways that are irreversible without specific knowledge of the transformation's form and parameters. Inverse transformation may be non-unique if only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
