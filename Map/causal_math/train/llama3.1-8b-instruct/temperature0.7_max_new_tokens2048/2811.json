  "Problem": "A function optimization process utilizes a Gaussian integral transformation with \\\\( G(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\). This function is utilized to optimize another function \\\\( H(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 \\\\) over its domain.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( F(x) = e^{x} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a point during the optimization process, will the outcome solely depend on the original function \\\\( H(x) \\\\) irrespective of the transformations \\\\( G(x) \\\\) and \\\\( F(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding another transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) further modifies the system. The final outcome depends on both transformations \\\\( G(x) \\\\) and \\\\( F(x) \\\\), as well as the original function \\\\( H(x) \\\\). Each transformation adds complexity and influences the overall behavior and results of the process, altering the effective landscape on which optimization occurs.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
