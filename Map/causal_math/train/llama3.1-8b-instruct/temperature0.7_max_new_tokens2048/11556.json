  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex signal, respectively. Analyze the effects of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 2 & 3 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) of the signal.\n\nGiven the final observable \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both), solely based on the Fourier transform at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\) can be affected similarly by different transformations due to linearity and superposition in the Fourier domain. Therefore, the presence or absence and types of matrix transformations applied can't be definitively concluded just from observing the end state transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
