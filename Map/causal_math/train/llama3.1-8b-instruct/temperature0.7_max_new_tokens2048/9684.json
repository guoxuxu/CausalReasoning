  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis setting where we analyze the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), denoted by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). We examine how the application of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which translates functions in time by a constant \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) affects the Laplace transform and its interpretation.\n\nFrom observing the final Laplace transform \\\\( H(s)G(s)e^{-as} \\\\), can we identify precisely which functions \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) were involved and the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) used for translation, assuming no other background information?",
  "Explanation": "The factors \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( G(s) \\\\), and \\\\( a \\\\) are intertwined in the transform \\\\( H(s)G(s)e^{-as} \\\\), and without additional constraints or information, multiple combinations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and \\\\( a \\\\) could yield the same transformed result. This ambiguity prevents unique determination of the input functions and parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Operator L → translation by constant a; Translation by constant a → function h(t) and function g(t); Function h(t) and function g(t) → Laplace transform H(s); Laplace transform H(s) → H(s)G(s)e^{-as}"
