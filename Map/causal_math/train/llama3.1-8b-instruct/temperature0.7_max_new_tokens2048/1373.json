  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate how the application of a convolution transformation defined by kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with its Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system.\n\nIf the convolution kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( (g \\\\ast h)(t) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under natural conditions, will the Laplace transform of the resultant function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast h)(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) be the same as the product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem dictates that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Laplace transforms. Hence, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast h)(t)\\\\}(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\), reflecting the direct and predictable outcome of the convolution under natural conditions without additional manipulation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
