  "Problem": "Consider the application of a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We analyze the impact of this transformation over time when the transformed function \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) is combined with another transformed function under different scenarios.\n\nIf an operation such as differentiation is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the resulting \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) still directly reflect the original characteristics of \\\\( g(t) = ae^{bt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening operations like differentiation alter the original function, which affects the Fourier transform result. Differentiation changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to a new function whose transform will reflect these changes, thus modifying the original characteristics in \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "differentiation → change in g(t); Fourier transform → change in G(ω); change in g(t) → change in G(ω); g(t) → G(ω); a → b; b → g(t); a → g(t); b → g(t)"
