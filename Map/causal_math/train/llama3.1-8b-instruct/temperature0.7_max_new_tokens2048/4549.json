  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature change over time is modeled by the differential equation \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\), where k is a temperature-dependent conductivity coefficient. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) applied at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( f(T) \\\\) which squares the temperature T is applied at time t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( T_0 \\\\), the initial temperature, was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) at the initial stage changes the starting temperature to \\\\( T_0^2 \\\\). Since the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the temperature itself, the squared initial condition accelerates the temperature increase, diverging significantly from the trajectory when started at \\\\( T_0 \\\\) under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
