  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\\\), where a is a constant. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to this equation over space and assessing its implication under different integration transformations.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T without any knowledge of intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Because the PDE and its transformation properties are linear and reversible in this scenario, it is possible to compute the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) to accurately retrieve the initial condition, utilizing the properties of the Fourier transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
