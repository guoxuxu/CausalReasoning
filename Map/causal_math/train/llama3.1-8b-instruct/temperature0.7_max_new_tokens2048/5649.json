  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts respectively, which are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We further analyze the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) changes the initial conditions by modulating both components \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\), which in turn, due to functions \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\), has a compounded and interdependent effect with matrices A and B, respectively. Hence, the state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will differ from the naive evolution without the initial application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
