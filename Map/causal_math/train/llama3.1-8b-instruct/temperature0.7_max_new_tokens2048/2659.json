  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Lz + \\eta(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) represents the influence of noise, which could be stochastic in nature. We explore the effect of introducing a control operation given by \\\\(g(z) = Dz\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf a control operation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), does the final state of the system at T only depend on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on interactions between \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( \\eta(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(D\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) not only modifies the state directly at that moment but may also alter how subsequent noise impacts the system due to interactions between \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\). Thus, the final state depends on both \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and the nature of \\\\(\\\\eta(t)\\\\) interactions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
