  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. This function is subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf a corrective function \\\\( k(t) = e^{-Bt} \\\\) (where B is a real number) is applied after the initial application of \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}z(t) \\\\), will the end transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be equivalent to the original transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "If B equals A, the intervention with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) precisely counters the effects of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), effectively reverting the system to its original state prior to any transformations. The subsequent integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) would then proceed as if no intervention had occurred. However, this exact cancelation is contingent on B being exactly A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
