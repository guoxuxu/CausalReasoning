  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\), in a region where the potential \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is influenced by the boundary conditions. Investigate the effects of perturbing the boundary condition with an additional complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is altered at t = 0 by applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\\\) without further changes, will the potential \\\\( \\\\phi(z, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the boundary conditions which uniquely determine the solution to the Laplace equation inside the domain. Since the boundary condition change is permanent, the potential distribution \\\\( \\\\phi(z, t) \\\\) will be different, illustrating the direct influence of the initial perturbation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
