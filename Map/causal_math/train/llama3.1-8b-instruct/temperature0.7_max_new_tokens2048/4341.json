  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at parameter t=0, will \\\\(g(z)\\\\) at t=0 be the same as if the transformation was not applied and the function was directly evaluated?",
  "Explanation": "At t=0, the transformation simplifies to \\\\(e^{zt} = 1\\\\), making the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{1}{z} dz\\\\), which results in 2\\\\pi i. This is equivalent to directly evaluating the integral of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) along C, thus both achieving the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
