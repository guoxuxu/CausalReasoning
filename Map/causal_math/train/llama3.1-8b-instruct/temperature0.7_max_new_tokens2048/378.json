  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a vector function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx}z(x)dx \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace Transform. We examine the impact of pre-multiplying the vector \\\\( z(x) \\\\) by a constant matrix Q before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z_Q(s) \\\\) resulting from a Q-modified \\\\( z(x) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without knowing matrix Q?",
  "Explanation": "The information about the matrix Q, which was used to modify \\\\( z(x) \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform, is crucial. Without knowing Q, it is impossible to reverse the modifications accurately, as \\\\( Z_Q(s) \\\\) depends linearly on the modified \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Knowing Z_Q(s) and Z(s) is necessary to determine z(x) because Z_Q(s) is derived from Z(s) and z(x)."
