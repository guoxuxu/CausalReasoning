  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal influence under a system governed by a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\). Suppose this system evolves through different transformations and interventions represented by high-order derivatives in the spectral domain, specifically considering how various filters influence the signal.\n\nGiven the system's output at \\\\( t_2 \\\\) and knowing an intervention was applied, can it be conclusively determined what type and when the intervention (i.e., specific damping or derivative operations) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could potentially lead to the same output at \\\\( t_2 \\\\), and it's impossible to uniquely back-calculate these interventions due to superposition and non-uniqueness issues in the inverse Laplace transform in presence of such filters or modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → High-order Derivatives; High-order Derivatives → Filters; Filters → System Output; System Output → Intervention; Intervention → Type of Intervention; Type of Intervention → Timing of Intervention; Timing of Intervention → Specific Damping or Derivative Operations"
