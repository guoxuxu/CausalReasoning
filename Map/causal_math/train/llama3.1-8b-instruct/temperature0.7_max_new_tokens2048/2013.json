  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(x) \\\\) initially and then the system evolves under its differential equation without further intervention, will the transformed system at \\\\( X \\\\) after time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( y(x) \\\\) evolved without applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the initial condition by switching to frequency domain. The evolution under the modified conditions, especially dealing with the integro-differential nature and the specific functions \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\), will diverge from the untransformed system's trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
