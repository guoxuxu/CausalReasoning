  "Problem": "Assume that a function \\\\( h: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We investigate the effects of this transformation on complex-valued functions and their corresponding Fourier Transforms.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), and then the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\xi) \\\\) is calculated, will this transform be the same as the Fourier Transform of the original \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\) to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the function significantly by introducing the exponential factor, which shifts and scales the Fourier Transform. This alteration changes the spectral properties, hence the Fourier Transform of the modified function will not be the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
