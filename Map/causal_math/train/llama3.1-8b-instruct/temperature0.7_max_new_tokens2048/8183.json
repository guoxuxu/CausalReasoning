  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nIf a correction operation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-bt} g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex number is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the outcome solely depend on \\\\( a \\\\) and not on \\\\( b \\\\) if we observe at time t > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The correction operation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-bt} g(t) \\\\) introduces a new modifying factor \\\\( b \\\\), and the resultant Laplace Transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) would depend on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) as the transformed function is now influenced by both exponential terms, affecting the final transformed outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
