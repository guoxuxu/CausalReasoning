  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = e^{at} + i t^b\\\\), a and b are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), acts on this complex function to analyze its behavior in a transformed domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), can we correctly revert to the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without any knowledge about changes to the parameters a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is invertible under typical conditions where a and b are known, allowing for a precise derivation of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its transform due to the uniqueness of Laplace transforms for standard function classes involving exponentials and polynomials.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
