  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a scalar field, and \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant vector. We investigate the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using another integral transformation, say a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the later state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still behave purely based on the original PDE's characteristics without consideration of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform as an intervention modifies the trajectory of the solution, incorporating effects from both the Fourier and Laplace transforms. This alteration affects the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), making it dependent on interactions from both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
