  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We study the response of a complex system under the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) while iterating through scenarios of system modification or the imposition of a boundary condition.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(T)\\\\} \\\\) at some time T, can we exactly infer the initial form \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(0)\\\\} \\\\) without prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it's impossible to precisely reconstruct the initial transformed state since the frequency component alters the phase and exponentials involved in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
