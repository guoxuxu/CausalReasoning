  "Problem": "Assume we have a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The system is subject to different treatment functions, specifically \\\\( f(x) = Sx \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) = Tx \\\\), where S and T are constant matrices. Consider how the transformations affect the system's state vector over time.\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) observed, is it possible to conclusively determine what interventions (whether \\\\( f(x), g(x) \\\\), or both) were applied during the system’s evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions and their non-unique effects on state trajectories (influence by S, T, and non-commutative interactions) mean that distinctly different sequences of transformations could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Therefore, without additional information, we cannot uniquely determine the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
