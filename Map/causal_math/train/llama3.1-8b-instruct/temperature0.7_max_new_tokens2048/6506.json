  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}(t-s)X(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and X(s) is a time-dependent input function. We explore the impact of modifying the input via the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original input function \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(X) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the input was altered by \\\\( g(X) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( X(t) \\\\) because the transformation effect of B may have changed the dynamics of the input in ways that are not recoverable solely from the output state \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
