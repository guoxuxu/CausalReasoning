  "Problem": "Consider a function $z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is a real frequency parameter. We analyze the effect of a differential operator $D = \\frac{d}{dt}$ on the function over time $t$, and consider the impact of linear transformations such as $L(z) = az + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers.\n\nCan we deduce the original function $z(t)$ at $t=0$ after observing $z(T)$, without knowing whether $L(z)$ was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Simply knowing $z(T)$ does not provide enough information to conclude if the transformation $L(z)$ was applied or not, as multiple combinations of $a$ and $b$ can lead to the same observed outcome depending on their interaction with $e^{i\\omega T}$. Without this data, we cannot trace back to an unambiguous original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
