  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setup where an initial complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) undergoes a series of transformations defined by the Laplace Transform followed by an Inverse Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) respectively. The transformations affect the function over the complex plane based on transformation parameters.\n\nIf during the transformations an additional function \\\\( z^*(s) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is applied between \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\), does this affect the final form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( z^*(s) = e^{at} \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the transformed function. It alters the original function by adding a complex exponential growth or decay factor depending on \\\\( a \\\\), which affects the final output after the inverse transformation is applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
