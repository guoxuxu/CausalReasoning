  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a user-controlled input and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a fixed angular frequency. The evolution of the system is studied through the application of the Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is set as a constant value at t=0 and left unchanged, will the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any future time t be solely dependent on the initial choice of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without external influence?",
  "Explanation": "In addition to the initial value of \\\\( u(t) \\\\), \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in Laplace space will also depend critically on the term \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), which continuously affects the function's behavior. The constant value of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affects only part of the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
