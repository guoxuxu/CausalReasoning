  "Problem": "In a statistical framework, consider a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z = X\\\\beta + \\\\epsilon \\\\), where \\\\( X \\\\) represents predictor variables matrix, \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) a coefficients vector, and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) the error terms. We are examining the effect of a simultaneous linear transformation applied to both \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) through matrix \\\\( T \\\\) which affects the causality from predictors to response.\n\nKnowing only the modified response \\\\( z \\\\) after transformations and interventions on \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\), can we exactly determine what transformations and interventions were initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z \\\\) could be a result of numerous possible combinations of transformations and adjustments to \\\\( \\\\beta' \\\\). The lack of one-to-one mapping between the transformations, interventions, and the resultant \\\\( z \\\\) causes ambiguity, preventing precise back-calculation of the interventions and transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
