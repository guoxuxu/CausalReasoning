  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function to analyze is \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number. The transformations are evaluated for their effect on the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over a variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be determined solely by \\\\( a \\\\) and not \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) introduces another variable influencing the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\). The characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), as each exponential transformation contributes uniquely to the resultant magnitude and phase changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
