  "Problem": "Consider a linear functional transformation operating on functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined in the complex domain. The transformation is described by the integral transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We are interested in analyzing the effect of an intervention function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where the transformed function becomes \\\\( g'(t) = g(t)h(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and allowed to evolve under the same transformation rules, will applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at the beginning alter the outcome of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at a later analysis point without any other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at the beginning affects the initial form of \\\\( g'(t) = g(t)h(t) \\\\) which in turn alters the calculated \\\\( G'(s) \\\\). The properties of the convolution theorem and the impact of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) ensure that the transformation output \\\\( G'(s) \\\\) is not the same as \\\\( G(s) \\\\) due to this initial change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
