  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\\\). This transformation is applied to a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\\\). Investigate the effects of the transformations and their reversibility across different conditions.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) be precisely inferred from \\\\( g(s) \\\\) without any modification or additional transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the lossy nature of the transformation caused by the smoothing effect of the Gaussian kernel, \\\\( g(s) \\\\) does not retain all the information needed to uniquely determine \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Precise inference of the original function is, thus, not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
