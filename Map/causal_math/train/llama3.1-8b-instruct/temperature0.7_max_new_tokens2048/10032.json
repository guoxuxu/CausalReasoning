  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied to a complex plane transformation, and the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\). Evaluate the causal relationships regarding the modulation of the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and the effect on the integral \\\\( I(z) \\\\).\n\nGiven a non-zero value of \\\\( I(z) \\\\), can we confirm if either a change in \\\\( w \\\\) or the introduction of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) or both occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The non-zero value of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) suggests a deviation from the original conditions, but it doesn't specify whether it was solely due to an alteration in \\\\( w \\\\), solely due to the damping, or a combination of both. The outcome doesn't distinctly delineate between the causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
