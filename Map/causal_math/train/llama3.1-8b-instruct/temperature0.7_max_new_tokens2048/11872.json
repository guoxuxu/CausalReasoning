  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) dt \\\\). The behavior of the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is analyzed under different settings, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform, will the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) for a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\) always result in the function \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is a standard result, always resulting in \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\) regardless of the value of \\\\( s \\\\) (assuming \\\\( s \\\\) has a real part greater than zero for convergence). This demonstrates a deterministic transform from cause (input function) to effect (Laplace transform).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
