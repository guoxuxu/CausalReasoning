  "Problem": "Investigate a vector field governed by a linear transformation and its potential modification by another function defined as \\( h(x) = \\int e^{Mt} dt \\cdot x \\), where M is a constant matrix. The original vector function is defined by \\( \\dot{x} = Lx \\), for a constant matrix L.\n\nIf a new transformation \\( k(x) = d^{Nt}x \\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The consequent state \\( x(T) \\) becomes dependent not merely on L but also on M from the initial transformation and N from the intervention at \\( t_1 \\). The transformations tangled by \\( h(x) \\) and \\( k(x) \\) significantly affect the trajectory, causing a cumulative alteration of the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
