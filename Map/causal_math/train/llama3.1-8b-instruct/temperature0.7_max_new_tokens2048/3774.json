  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( U_{xx} = -\\\\lambda U \\\\) where \\\\( U(x, t) \\\\) is a function of space x and time t, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant. Study the effects of applying a Fourier transform over space, resulting in the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), and analyze its behavior under the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) = e^{-\\\\alpha k^2 t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{U}(k, t) \\\\), can we determine if the transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied at the initial time t = 0 with absolute certainty, knowing only \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) but not \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it's impossible to determine if the spatial transform \\\\( G(k) \\\\) was applied, as it could merely be part of the natural evolution of the system under the given differential equation, especially if transformations yielding a similar decay in terms of k due to conditions at time t = 0 could be misconstrued as the effect of \\\\( G(k) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
