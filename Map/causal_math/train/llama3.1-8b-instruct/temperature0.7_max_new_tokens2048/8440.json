  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex vector in a system. An integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int e^{-At}z(t) dt \\\\) impacts this setup over a period \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) after an undisclosed intervention on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) during the period \\\\( [0, T] \\\\), can the specific alterations to \\\\( A \\\\) be identified solely based on knowing \\\\( T[z] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple alterations to \\\\( A \\\\) could result in equivalent effects on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thereby leading to the same output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\). Determining specific changes to \\\\( A \\\\) based on the output alone is indeterminate without additional constraints or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
