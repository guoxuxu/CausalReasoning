  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This function is transformed by the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\} \\\\). We explore whether causal relationships about the properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) can be discerned from the transformed function.\n\nIf a constant \\\\( b \\\\) is added to the exponent in the time-domain function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\\\) during the observation period, will the Laplace transform have its pole shifted solely by \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding \\\\( b \\\\) to the exponent modifies the function to \\\\( e^{(a+b)t} \\\\), whose Laplace transform results in a pole at \\\\( s = -(a+b) \\\\), indicating a direct shift due to the additive intervention of \\\\( b \\\\) in the exponent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "b → a; b → f(t); a → f(t); b → Laplace transform; a → Laplace transform; f(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → pole shift; f(t) → pole shift"
