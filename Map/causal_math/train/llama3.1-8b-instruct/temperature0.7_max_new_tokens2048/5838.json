  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\). We explore the impact of transforming the variable \\\\(u\\\\) using a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan one deduce the original value \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), the transformation by the constant \\\\( k \\\\) alters the initial conditions. The nonlinear dynamics make it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing the specific transformation or absence of it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
