  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We study the impact of a transformation performed by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without an indication of whether the transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) occurred, the altered initial conditions cannot be accurately traced back. The influence of \\\\( N \\\\) could mask or distort the effects of \\\\( M \\\\), complicating the recovery of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
