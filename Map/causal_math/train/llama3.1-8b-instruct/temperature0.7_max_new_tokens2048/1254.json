  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial function Z(t) described by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( Z(0) \\\\) from observing \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) at time T if the function z(t) was not known to have been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the function's effect, such as phase rotation, could lead to multiple potential original states \\\\( Z(0) \\\\) due to the complex interplay between the function's frequency and the integral operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
