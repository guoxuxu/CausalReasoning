  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), with a control input \\\\( u \\\\). Here, A is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics and B is the control matrix. An operator applies a transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where C is another constant matrix determining a specific kind of state transformation.\n\nIf a control input \\\\( u(t) = Dv(t) \\\\) (with D as a control matrix and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) a time-varying vector) is applied at some \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the matrices A and C, assuming initial transformation but ignoring control matrix effects (D)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is dependent on the matrices A, C, and critically D, as the intervention through the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) alters the path the system takes post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\). The influence of the control modification can't be disregarded, making the trajectory reliant on the control process, including matrix D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
