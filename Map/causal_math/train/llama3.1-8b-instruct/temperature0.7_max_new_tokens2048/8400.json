  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a complex function space defined by \\\\( L(f)(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation is the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\). The causal analysis investigates the role played by the parameter \\\\( z \\\\) in the transformed function and how it affects the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven a modified Laplace transform output after the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) has been altered to \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and knowing the alteration process involves multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the new Laplace transform result?",
  "Explanation": "With knowledge of the functional change from \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = tf(t) \\\\) and the transformed result, it is possible to backtrack by treating the Laplace transformation of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as a derivative in the \\\\( z \\\\)-domain, thus uniquely retrieving \\\\( f(t) \\\\) using inverse processes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
