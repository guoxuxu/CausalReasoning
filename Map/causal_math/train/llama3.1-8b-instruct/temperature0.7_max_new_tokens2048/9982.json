  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent time-dependent real functions. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform on this function and then interpreting the inverse transform without and with interventions.\n\nFrom the observed function in the time domain after applying an unknown operator and taking the inverse Laplace of its transform, can we definitively determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the exact operator used?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the operator used in the Laplace domain (or its corresponding differential operator in the time domain), we cannot accurately backtrack to ascertain the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The unknown modifications to the Laplace transform obscure the original function's features.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
