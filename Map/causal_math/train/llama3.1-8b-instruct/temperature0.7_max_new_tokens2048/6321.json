  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nIf \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is initialized at 1 (i.e., \\\\( z(0) = e^{0} = 1 \\\\)) and allowed to evolve under the given transformation without any intervention, will the path from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be a spiral in the complex plane for any non-zero \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The factor \\\\( e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) naturally leads to a spiral trajectory in the complex plane due to the presence of \\\\( b \\\\), which gives the exponential a rotating component \\\\( e^{bit} \\\\), combined with an exponential growth (\\\\( a > 0 \\\\)) or decay (\\\\( a < 0 \\\\)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "b → imaginary component of z(t); a → real component of z(t); a + b → argument of z(t); a + b → exponential growth/decay of |z(t)|; b → rate of change of argument of z(t); a + b → |z(t)|; a → |z(t)|; |z(t)| → shape of path in the complex plane; shape of path in the complex plane → spiral or not; b → spiral or not"
