  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system operating on a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\), where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) describes a path in the complex plane. The system is described by the matrix operator \\\\(L\\\\) such that the transformation is \\\\(w(t) = L[z(t)]\\\\) involving a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\). Analyzing the effect of modifications to \\\\(L\\\\) under different scenarios.\n\nCan we exactly determine the nature of interventions applied (whether just \\\\(L\\\\), just \\\\(H\\\\), or both) given only the final state \\\\(w(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the final state \\\\(w(T)\\\\) of a complex transformation involving potential multiple operators is typically ambiguous without additional information. Both \\\\(L\\\\) and \\\\(H\\\\) can independently or jointly affect the final state in ways that might not be decodable solely from the output due to superposition of effects and potential overlaps in their operational characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
