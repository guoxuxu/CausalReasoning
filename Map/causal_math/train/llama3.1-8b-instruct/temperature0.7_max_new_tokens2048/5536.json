  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) to this function and its inverse scenarios.\n\nGiven the output from the inverse Laplace transform as \\\\( t e^{at} \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude which operational change (specifically, a differentiation in this case) was applied in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "The specific time-domain expression \\\\( t e^{at} \\\\), which resulted from the inverse Laplace transform, directly indicates that the change in the Laplace domain was \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2} \\\\). This is uniquely associated with the operation of differentiation in the Laplace domain, allowing for a precise determination of the intervention type.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → f(z); s → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → e^(at); e^(at) → t; t → inverse Laplace transform; inverse Laplace transform → t e^(at); operational change → differentiation; differentiation → Laplace transform"
