  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane and governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be identically equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, introducing an exponential factor influenced by \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\). This change in the initial condition alters how the system evolves under the differential equation, resulting in a trajectory that differs from that of the unmodified initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
