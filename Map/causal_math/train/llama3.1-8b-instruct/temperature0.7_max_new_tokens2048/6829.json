  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system evolves over time t and undergoes an integral transform using the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further modification, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = \\\\( \\\\omega + i\\\\beta \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real constant) uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), thereby clearly indicating the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in its denominator. Therefore, identifying \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at any complex s is straightforward and unique.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
