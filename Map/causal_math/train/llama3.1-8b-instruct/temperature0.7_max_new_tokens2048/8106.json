  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Let the causality of this transformation be examined considering both linear differential equations and external interventions in the form of multiplicative exponential functions.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of a function, is it possible to clearly identify the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "In the context of Laplace transforms, if no additional transformation is applied, recovering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) typically involves inversely transforming \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Assuming proper conditions (like causality, and regions of convergence), this inversion uniquely determines \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
