  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nSuppose an additional transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention. Will the final system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on matrices A and B, without influence from C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( H(z) \\\\) introduces complexity by incorporating the function \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), affecting the system’s trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T together with the initial transformation by T(z). Ultimately, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by all matrices A, B, C, and D, reflecting the compounded transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
