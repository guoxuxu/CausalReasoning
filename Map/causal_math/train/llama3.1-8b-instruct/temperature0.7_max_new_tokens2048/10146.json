  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) follow the differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the trajectory of z over time t.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's unclear how the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) influenced the initial conditions. This ambiguity, especially if C does not commute with A or B, prevents the exact determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
