  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\) describing the trajectory of a particle in the complex plane, where \\\\( R(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the radial and angular components, respectively. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under its natural trajectory without further intervention, will the position of the particle at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\omega t \\\\), which leads to a different trajectory in the complex plane. The extra rotation introduced by the transformation changes the particle's path, resulting in a different position at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
