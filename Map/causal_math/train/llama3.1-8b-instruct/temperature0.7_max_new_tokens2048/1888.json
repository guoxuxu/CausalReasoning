  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and analyze its effects over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether the Fourier transform of an initial condition, the addition of a heat source, or both), only by observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) could theoretically result from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions due to the overlapping influences in the linear heat equation. The superposition principle allows different initial and intervening conditions to produce similar final states, making it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
