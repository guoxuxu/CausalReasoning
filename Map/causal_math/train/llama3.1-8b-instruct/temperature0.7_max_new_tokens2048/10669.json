  "Problem": "Investigate the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) to a complex variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nWill the end behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\) for \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same if initially \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) compared to if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) evolves directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( x_0^2 + ci \\\\), which alters the trajectory. The complex square and addition of \\\\( ci \\\\) contribute fundamentally different growth behaviors as the equation evolves, particularly due to the non-linear and multi-valued nature of complex squares.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
