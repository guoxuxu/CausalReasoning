  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_{t} + a u_{x} = 0 \\\\) where a is a constant. Let's explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t)) \\\\) on this equation over time.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a filtering operation given by multiplication with \\\\( e^{-b\\\\xi^2} \\\\) (where b is a constant) is applied to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t_1) \\\\), will the behavior of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of a?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the amplitude of frequency components differently, but due to the linear dependency of the original equation on the parameter a, the evolution character still depends on a. The decay or growth of each component in the frequency domain remains influenced by a.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
