  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant complex matrix. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) at s = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state at a later time still satisfy the initial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) does not alter the nature of the differential equation governing z(t). The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) remains consistent for all transformed states, as the transformation only changes the representation of z, not its dependency described by P.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
