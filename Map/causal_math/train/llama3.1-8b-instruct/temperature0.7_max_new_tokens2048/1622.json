  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\) over time is studied, where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the integral transformation output \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) for all time points without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform can be used to reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\\\) precisely, as long as the transform exists and is unique, which is true for the exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
