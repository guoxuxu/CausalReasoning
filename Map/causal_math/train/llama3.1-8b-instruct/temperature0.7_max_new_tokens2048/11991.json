  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nGiven the frequency domain output of a transformed and system-processed signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we determine the specific form of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) applied, knowing the original frequency \\\\( ω \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency domain representation post-intervention can potentially align with different forms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) due to the convolution properties and spectral overlap. Without additional constraints or data, multiple impulse responses could theoretically yield similar transformations, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from the frequency domain output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
