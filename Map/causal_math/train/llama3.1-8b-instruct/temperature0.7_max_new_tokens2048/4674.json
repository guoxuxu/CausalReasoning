  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the displacement vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time t is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by the function \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), on the system behavior.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the Fourier transform \\\\( F(x(T)) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform obscures direct time-domain information such as initial states due to its integral over all times, making it impossible to precisely deduce \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without specific knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( F(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
