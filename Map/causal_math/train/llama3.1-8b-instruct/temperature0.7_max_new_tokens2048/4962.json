  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nBy examining the output of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\\\), where T is an arbitrary time, can we deduce the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) always starts from 1 when traced over time from t=0, the Fourier transform will always identify the frequency component at 1, independent of T, thus indicating the initial condition was \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
