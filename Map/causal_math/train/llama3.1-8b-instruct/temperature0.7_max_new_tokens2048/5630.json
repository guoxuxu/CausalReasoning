  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) in the context of a mapping from the complex plane to itself. We explore the effect of computing the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) \\\\) of this function, where the Fourier transform is defined in the integral form as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-2\\\\pi i z \\\\xi} dz \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[f](\\\\xi) \\\\) of the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), can one deduce the specific complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) on which \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform produces an output that represents a broad frequency composition, and the inverse process is ambiguous without knowing initial phase and additional constraints—especially with non-periodic, exponentially growing functions like \\\\( e^{z} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
