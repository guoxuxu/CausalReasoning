  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) without any further manipulation, will the resulting transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be localized at \\\\( \\\\omega = A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) is indeed a delta function centered at \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( F(z) = 2\\\\pi \\\\delta(\\\\omega - A) \\\\) due to the properties of the Fourier transform of exponential oscillatory functions. This precisely aligns the frequency component with \\\\( A \\\\), showcasing direct correspondence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
