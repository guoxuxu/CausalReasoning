  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a constant input voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and a resistive load R. A time-varying inductance \\\\( L(t) = L_0 e^{kt} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) through the circuit over time.\n\nBy measuring the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine the initial inductance \\\\( L_0 \\\\) without knowing that the inductance was time-varying?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the time variation in inductance, we lack critical information about how the impedance changed over time, making it impossible to accurately backtrack to the initial conditions solely based on observing \\\\( I(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
