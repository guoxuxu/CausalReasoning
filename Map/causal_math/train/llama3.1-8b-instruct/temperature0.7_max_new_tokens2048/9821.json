  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it is evolved according to \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the evolution started directly at \\\\( w_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( g(w) \\\\) rotates the complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) in the complex plane by \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\), which modifies its initial condition. As a result, the trajectory under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) will evolve differently from \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta}w_0 \\\\) than it would from \\\\( w_0 \\\\), leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
