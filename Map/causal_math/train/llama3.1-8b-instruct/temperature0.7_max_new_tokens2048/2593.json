  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), where \\\\(w(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) over a variable t, with z as a complex variable. The function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed via another function \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\). Analyze the impact of transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) on the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(z)\\\\) is computed subsequently without any further adjustments, will \\\\(w(z)\\\\) take the form of \\\\(w_{new}(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^2 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) alters the integral operation within the complex function. Specifically, \\\\(w(z)\\\\) will be computed using the new function \\\\(g(t)\\\\), which by definition is \\\\(t^2 f(t)\\\\). This directly modifies the integrand, resulting in the form \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^2 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) for \\\\(w(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
