  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\) in a complex function domain, where \\( A \\) is a complex constant matrix and \\( x \\) is an initial complex vector. This setup is used to analyze the system's behavior under transformations involving integral transformations such as the Laplace Transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).\n\nFrom the state \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\), can we conclusively identify previous interventions (such as the transformations \\( e^{At}x \\) and \\( e^{Bs}s \\)), just by examining \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations (including \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)) could lead to similar \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\) outcomes due to their complex interdependencies and the overlapping influence on the state trajectories. Thus, it is impossible to ascertain exactly which interventions were applied solely from \\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{z(T)\\} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
