  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate the causality in the changes of original function and its behavior under various transformations.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) resultant from an unknown intervention on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we precisely identify both the original function and the intervention used?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the wide range of potential functions and interventions that can yield similar Laplace transforms, it is generally not possible to uniquely backtrack and identify both the original function and the exact nature of the intervention without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
