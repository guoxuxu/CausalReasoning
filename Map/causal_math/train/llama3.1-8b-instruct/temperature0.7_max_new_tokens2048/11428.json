  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, with k being a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved through different configurations and timings of the interventions \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Due to the properties of exponential functions, particularly in the complex plane, different sequences or types of interventions might result in the same outcome, leading to indeterminacy in identifying the interventions from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
