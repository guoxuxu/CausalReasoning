  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution along a rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial heat distribution function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and a later heat source intervention represented by \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan the initial heat distribution \\\\(h(x)\\\\) be uniquely determined from the temperature distribution observed at time T, \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), assuming no intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the exact initial heat distribution \\\\(h(x)\\\\) from a later distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) is generally an ill-posed problem. The diffusion process governed by the heat equation causes dispersal and equalization of temperature, which often results in loss of information about specific initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
