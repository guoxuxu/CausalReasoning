  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, subjected to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\) over time t, where S is a complex constant. We are analyzing how this transformation interacts with the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is another complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to conclusively deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation could potentially alter \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in a way that is complex conjugate, magnitude, or phase-preserving, hence modifying its evolution path under the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
