  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely trace back to the original signal \\\\(x(0)\\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\(y(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x(t)\\\\), without the knowledge of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), one cannot accurately retrieve \\\\(x(0)\\\\) because different values of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) could lead to different initial conditions that would yield the same \\\\(y(T)\\\\) after the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
