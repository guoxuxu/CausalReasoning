  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain, with boundary conditions defined by the prescription \\\\(u = g\\\\) on the boundary. An integral transformation \\\\(f(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u dt\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, is considered over a period [0, T].\n\nIf after a time T the function is found to be \\\\(f(u)\\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\(u\\\\) (satisfying Laplace's equation) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function \\\\(u\\\\) that satisfies Laplace’s equation from its integral transformation \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is generally not possible without additional information, as multiple different functions could yield the same transformed output due to the nature of integral and matrix exponential operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
