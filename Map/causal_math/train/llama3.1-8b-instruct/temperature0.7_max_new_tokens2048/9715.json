  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), with \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant, and \\\\( k \\\\) a fixed complex constant. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) introduces another scaling factor that significantly affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Both \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) contribute to transforming the original dynamics of the equation, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
