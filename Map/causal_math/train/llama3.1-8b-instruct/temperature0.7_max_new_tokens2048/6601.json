  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We explore the behavior of the function under different transformations and integration conditions.\n\nIf we change the variable from \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( u \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\), then compute \\\\( z(u) \\\\) directly, will this result in the same value as substituting \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\) directly into the original integral without recomputing?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the variable requires adjusting the differential as well. The original differential dx will become \\\\( 2x dx \\\\) when expressed in terms of \\\\( u \\\\), meaning the transformed integral does not simply substitute \\\\( x^2 \\\\) for \\\\( x \\\\). This results in a different expression and, consequently, a different value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
