  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nIf \\( D \\) is applied to \\( g(t) \\) before performing the inverse Laplace Transform, does the newly retrieved function \\( h(t) \\) remain the same as \\( g(t) \\) without applying \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( D \\) before the inverse transform changes the differential structure of the function. Specifically, the relationship within the Laplace domain becomes \\( sF(s) - sf(0) + aF(s) \\), thus altering \\( h(t) \\) from the original \\( g(t) \\), adding terms dependent on derivatives and scaled versions of the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
