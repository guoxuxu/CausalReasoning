  "Problem": "We examine the impact of a complex transformation given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w(z) = e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) on the real and imaginary components of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\dot{y} = x \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) can result in multiple potential initial conditions that could evolve to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), depending on the period of the underlying harmonic motion of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Without certainty regarding the application of the transformation, the initial state cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
