  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\beta)t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are real numbers governing exponential growth and oscillation, respectively.\n\nCan we precisely identify what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both) based solely on the state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Even if transformations have distinct parameters, their effects on the system's trajectory via exponential scaling and phase shift can overlap, making it impossible to ascertain whether one, both, or a combination of them with particular timings was applied, based solely on the final state at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
