  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and B is the control input matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation of the states defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after applying a control input at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine what transformation (either initial or through control input) led to this state, solely by knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact contributions of the initial transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and subsequent control input \\\\( u(t) = v \\\\) from the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is complex due to their overlapping influences. The non-trivial combined effect of M via \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and D and B via control strategy obscures which dynamics shaped the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
