  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function is subject to transformations using Fourier transforms over time.\n\nGiven the final transformed signal at T, can we decisively determine whether the intervention of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) occurred if both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) have similar frequency components?",
  "Explanation": "If the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) overlap significantly or are indistinguishable due to their similar values, it is challenging to discern conclusively whether an intervention occurred by analyzing the frequency domain data alone. The transformation results might suggest the presence of similar frequencies arising from either one condition or their combination.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → z(t); z(t) → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → T; T → intervention of w(t); w(t) → similar frequency components; similar frequency components → ambiguous result"
