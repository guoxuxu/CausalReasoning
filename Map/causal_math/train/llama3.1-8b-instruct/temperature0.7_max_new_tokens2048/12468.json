  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined through the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We want to examine the effects of multiplying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by another function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which represents an integral operator, on the original time-domain function z(t).\n\nIf \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) creating \\\\( W(s) = H(s)Z(s) \\\\), and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( W(s) \\\\), is \\\\( w(t) \\\\) equal to the convolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) (denoted as \\\\( z(t) * e^{at} \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiplication in the Laplace domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain, applying \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and taking the inverse Laplace transform result in the convolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with the function corresponding to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which is \\\\( e^{at} \\\\). Thus, \\\\( w(t) = z(t) * e^{at} \\\\).",
