  "Problem": "Consider a closed system involving a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\) where \\\\( p \\\\) is a pole. The input signal is \\\\( x(t) = e^{st} \\\\). We study the system's behavior under Laplace transforms and analyze the effects of introducing an interrupting signal \\\\( y(t) = u(t)e^{qt} \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the step function.\n\nWill the output signal's form in the s-domain, after Laplace transforming \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) input and processing by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), change if the operational value of \\\\( s \\\\) equates exactly to the pole \\\\( p \\\\) of the transfer function without any external intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Passing signal \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) where \\\\( s = p \\\\) through the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\\\) leads to an indeterminate form 1/0 since the Laplace transform places s at the pole p. This results in an unstable system response, fundamentally different from non-pole inputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
