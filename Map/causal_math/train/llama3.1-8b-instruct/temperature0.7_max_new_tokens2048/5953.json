  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output voltage \\( V(t) \\) in an RLC circuit is governed by the differential equation \\( L \\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C} V = 0 \\), where L, R, and C are constants representing the inductance, resistance, and capacitance respectively. We examine the impact of a Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{V(t)\\} \\) applied to the voltage \\( V(t) \\) and its inverse transform.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ V(t) \\} \\) is calculated at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the voltage \\( V(t) \\) at a later time t = T still satisfy the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operation that does not alter the underlying differential equation governing the system. The system will continue to evolve according to the same differential equation, and \\( V(t) \\) will satisfy it at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
