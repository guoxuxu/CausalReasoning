  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). The impact of a Fourier transform on the wave function is studied to see how it affects the system's evolution.\n\nCan we infer the original wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = T)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the Fourier transform was applied initially, the linearity and time-reversibility of the Schrödinger equation and the invertibility of the Fourier transform allow the reconstruction of \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = 0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t = T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
