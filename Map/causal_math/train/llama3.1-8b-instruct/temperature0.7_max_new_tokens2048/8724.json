  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a constant matrix. We introduce the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is another constant matrix, to study how this affects the trajectories over time t.\n\nBy knowing the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), based solely on the final state observed?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of transformations and interventions. Since the matrix exponentials do not necessarily commute, and their effects on the trajectory can overlap or counteract each other, it's impossible to definitively ascertain the series of transformations just by observing the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
