  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nGiven the final form of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), is it possible to deduce whether the correction factor \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the final result of \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is dependent on the interplay between the correction factor and the parameter t during the transformation, multiple combinations of these factors could yield equivalent forms of \\\\(g(z)\\\\). Without specific knowledge of t or the untransformed function, identifying the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
