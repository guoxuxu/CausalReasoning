  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. To analyze causal effect and intervention, we study the system's behavior under a transformation defined by \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where M is a linear operator.\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, if we do not know whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T does not allow us to accurately trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) unless we know whether the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) was applied. The transformation could have modified the initial state in a complex way, especially if the operators M and L interact in a non-trivial manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
