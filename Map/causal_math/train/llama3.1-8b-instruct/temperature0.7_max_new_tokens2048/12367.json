  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), with \\( B \\) also a constant matrix, is applied at time \\( t \\). We explore the effect of this transformation on the system's evolution.\n\nCan the specific interventions used \\( (f(z) = e^{Bt}z, g(z) = e^{Ct}z) \\) be uniquely identified from the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and parameters \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) could lead to the same \\( z(T) \\), especially since matrix exponentials do not necessarily have unique inverses or might combine in various ways. Thus, identifying exact interventions from \\( z(T) \\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
