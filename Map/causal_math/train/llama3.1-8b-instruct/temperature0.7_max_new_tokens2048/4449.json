  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The system undergoes an operation defined by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\), where U is a constant, invertible matrix, and t is the time variable.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without additional influences, does \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T end up differently than if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) had been evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\) essentially performs a similarity transformation on \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), it leaves the spectrum of \\\\( M \\\\) and thus the solutions to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) invariant. Therefore, the trajectory from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time under no intervention is the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
