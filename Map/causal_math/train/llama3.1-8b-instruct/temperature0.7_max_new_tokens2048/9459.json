  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf a new constant \\\\( k \\\\) is introduced modifying the equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = (i\\\\omega + k) z + \\\\lambda \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 < \\\\tau \\\\), will the modified equation's output to \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\) depend only on the new parameters and not on the original parameters (\\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). However, since the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) both influence the result by \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the outcome depends on both the old (\\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\)) and new parameters (\\\\( k \\\\)), affecting the overall trajectory and thus the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
