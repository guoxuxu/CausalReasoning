  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) that represents a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which undergoes a transformation given by the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\). We examine how this transformation affects the causal relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) \\) at a certain time \\( t_1 \\) undergoes an additional transformation by a different function \\( h(t) = t^2 \\) before the Laplace transformation, will the end result \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t) \\cdot h(t)) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) be independent of \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\( z(t) \\) with \\( h(t) = t^2 \\) alters the function before the Laplace transformation is applied, causing \\( \\mathcal{L}(z(t) \\cdot h(t)) \\) to depend significantly on the nature of \\( h(t) \\). The output in the frequency domain will reflect the compounded effect of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\), and thus is not independent of \\( h(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
