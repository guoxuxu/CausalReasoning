  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\), represented by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) is computed for a function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\) experiencing no other external forces or transformations, will the presence of \\( \\omega \\) fundamentally change how \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) behaves?",
  "Explanation": "The parameter \\( \\omega \\) directly affects the frequency component of \\( z(t) \\) and thus alters the Fourier transform by shifting its frequency spectrum. This leads to a transformation of the frequency-domain representation centered at \\( \\omega \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
