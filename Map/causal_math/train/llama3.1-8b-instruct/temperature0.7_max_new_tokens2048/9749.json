  "Problem": "Analyze the response of a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) to the system state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and study the progression over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is taken for the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and this transformed state is evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further handling, will the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T be the same as directly evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) under the given PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition changes its representation from spatial to frequency domain. Evolving this transformed initial condition under the differential operator L without converting it back means solving a different problem in the Fourier domain, leading to a result that might not correspond to the simple time evolution in the spatial domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
