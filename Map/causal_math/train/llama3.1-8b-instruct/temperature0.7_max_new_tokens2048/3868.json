  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a function space, defined as L[f(x)] = f''(x) - 4f(x). We are interested in how the use of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform denoted by \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), affects the solutions of the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0.\n\nKnowing only the final expression in the Laplace domain, can you identify if the Fourier Transform was applied prior to the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the boundary conditions, initial function behavior, or specific modifications made by the Fourier Transform, the changes induced in the Laplace domain could resemble those from various transformations or initial condition setups. It is therefore not possible to definitively conclude if the Fourier Transform was applied solely based on the final expression in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
