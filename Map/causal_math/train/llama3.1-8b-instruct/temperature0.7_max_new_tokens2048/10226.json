  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by the heat equation in a rod, described by \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the position along the rod. Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) to the equation and the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) after a specific time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we uniquely re-establish the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation's deterministic nature and the linear, invertible property of the Fourier transform allow us to recover the initial condition from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), regardless of whether a transform was used initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
