  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. Suppose we analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform's output, can we precisely recover the time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information or constraints?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace transform \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) generally requires inverse transformation knowledge and conditions about the path of integration in the complex plane. Without such information, precise recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is indeterminate due to complexities in the inverse Laplace transform and possible ambiguities in function characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
