  "Problem": "Examine the causal implications in the solution domain of the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bz^2\\\\), where A and B are matrices. We will consider the effects of implementing an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Bs}s ds \\cdot z \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined which transformations (either \\\\( G(z) \\\\), \\\\( H(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the state value at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the involvement of non-linear terms and the possibility of overlapping effects from the transformations \\\\( G(z) \\\\) and \\\\( H(z) \\\\), multiple combinations of transformations could lead to the same observed results at time T. This ambiguity prevents a clear determination of which interventions were exactly applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
