  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) on this function, specifically, the Laplace transform.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\), can we unequivocally trace back to discover the original oscillation frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any additional information about system's starting conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) distinctly carries the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the denominator. This unique characteristic in the complex plane enables us to infer back to the precise value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) through the pole's location.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
