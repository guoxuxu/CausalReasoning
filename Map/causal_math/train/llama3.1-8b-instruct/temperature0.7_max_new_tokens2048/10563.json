  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention by adding a term \\\\( e^{ht} \\\\) (where h is another complex constant) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t = 0, will the resultant Laplace transformation depend neither on k nor on h?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} + e^{ht} \\\\). This alteration significantly changes the Laplace transform result to \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-ik} + \\\\frac{1}{s-h} \\\\). Therefore, the transformed function distinctly depends on both parameters k and h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
