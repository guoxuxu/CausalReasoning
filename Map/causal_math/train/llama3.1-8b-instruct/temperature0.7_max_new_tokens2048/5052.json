  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We assess the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a real constant, and investigate how it influences the behavior over time t.\n\nGiven the final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine which transformations (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( f(t) \\\\), or both) were applied, only by knowing the value at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different sequences or combinations of transformations due to the properties of complex exponentials. Multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) could yield the same effect, making it impossible to uniquely distinguish between the transformations that were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
