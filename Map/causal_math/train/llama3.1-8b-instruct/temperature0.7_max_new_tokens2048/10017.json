  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the system equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by introducing a phase shift, which alters both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) over time. This phase alteration can lead to a fundamentally different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when evolved under the given differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
