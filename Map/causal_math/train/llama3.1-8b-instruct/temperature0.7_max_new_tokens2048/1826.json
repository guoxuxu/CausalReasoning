  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = a+bt+ict^2 \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants, and study the application of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) after observing the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without previous data about their values?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier Transform encodes all the information about the time-domain function, extracting exact values of \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) requires solving an inverse problem which may not be unique without additional constraints or knowledge about the phase and original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
