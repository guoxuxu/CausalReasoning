  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) that transforms a function \\( u(x) \\) using a convolution integral \\( L[u](x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x - t)u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( k \\) is the kernel function. We scrutinize the effects of an initial function \\( u_0(x) \\) and its interaction with different kernels, including potential changes in kernel midway.\n\nGiven the final convolution output \\( L[u](x) \\) observed at time T, can we determine which specific kernels \\( k_1(x) \\), \\( k_2(x) \\), or both were applied to \\( u_0(x) \\), based solely on the convolution at that point?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution output at time T can potentially result from various combinations of kernels or even similar effects from different kernels. Convolution, being a linear but often non-invertible operation, lacks the uniqueness in most contexts to specify the paths of interactions through kernel modifications alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
