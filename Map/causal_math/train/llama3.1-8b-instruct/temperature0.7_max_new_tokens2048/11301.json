  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. This scenario examines the impacts of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\), with \\\\( P \\\\) being another constant complex matrix, on the system's evolution over time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z \\\\) without the transformation by \\\\( P \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(z) = Pz \\\\) at the initial time modifies the starting vector. The evolution of the system is then based on the transformed initial condition \\\\( Pz_0 \\\\), leading to a different trajectory and consequently a different state at time T compared to if no transformation had been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
