  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to this system.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by altering the constants A and B to A' and B', will the Laplace Transform of the resulting function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at time T equal the original transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) modified by the intervention constants?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the governing differential equations, which affects the Laplace Transform. Consequently, the transform of the modified function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) will depend both on the original conditions and how the parameters A and B were altered. The resulting transform at any time cannot solely be predicted by the original constants due to the interaction of the dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
