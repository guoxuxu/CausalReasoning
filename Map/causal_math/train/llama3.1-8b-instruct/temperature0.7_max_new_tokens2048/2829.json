  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nIf the initial conditions for \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) are given without any external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} \\\\), will the velocity field at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be solely dependent on the viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) and initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of external forces, the evolution of the velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations influenced only by the initial conditions and the fluid’s properties, mainly the viscosity \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\). Thus, the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) will strictly depend on these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
