  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z is a function representing system states over time. The impact of applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T, can the specific contributions of B and C be uniquely identified, assuming both \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of matrices B and C through the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) on z complicates the tracing back to distinct contributions due to the integrative nature of these transformations. Both can modify the trajectory of z in overlapping ways, making it impossible to isolate their individual effects just from the output at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
