  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We're studying the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over time t.\n\nGiven the result \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely identify if any transformations like \\\\( U(z) \\\\) or any other were applied prior to t = T by simply analyzing the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates information over a period which is influenced by the specific transformation applied within that interval. Different pre-applied transformations like \\\\( U(z) \\\\) could lead to equivalent results under \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T, making it impossible to clearly distinguish between them just by the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
