  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with time evolution defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An operator transformation given by \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) be deduced exactly from the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) was applied, it’s impossible to reliably determine whether the observed \\\\( y(T) \\\\) resulted from \\\\( y_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Cy_0 \\\\). The potential application of \\\\( C \\\\) renders the deduction of \\\\( y_0 \\\\) ambiguous unless additional information about \\\\( C \\\\) or its application is known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
