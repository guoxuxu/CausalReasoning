  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) of \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\), followed by its evolution in time is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(h(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(u)\\\\) (the inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the solution \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) at any T > t_1 be influenced solely by the operator L and not be affected by the initial Fourier transform or the inverse applied during intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying the inverse Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) modifies the state again, reintroducing or re-scaling frequency components differently, which can yield a final state at T that reflects the combined effects of the original \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), the operator L, and the intervention. The trajectory and final state are thus influenced by all three factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
