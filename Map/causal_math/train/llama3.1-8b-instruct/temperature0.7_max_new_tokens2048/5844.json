  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution condition.\n\nKnowing the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), and knowing that interventions were made, can we determine whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) or both were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) can overlap or negate each other, especially depending on their application timing relative to each other and to \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Given multiple points of intervention and the diffusion characteristics of the heat equation, multiple feasible scenarios could lead to the same final state, making unique identification of interventions used impossible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
