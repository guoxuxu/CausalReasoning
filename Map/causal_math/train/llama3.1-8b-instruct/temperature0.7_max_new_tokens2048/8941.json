  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation considered is applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) is applied to the initial function and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the initial condition from \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) to a different function, altering the initial spectrum of temperature distribution. This change in the spectral composition modifies how heat propagates along the rod, leading to a different temperature profile at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
