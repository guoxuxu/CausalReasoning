  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is time and i is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), which transforms the complex exponential function into a function of a complex variable s.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), can we determine the exact original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from which it was transformed without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\), is unique to this form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). There would be no ambiguity in mapping back from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-i} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) as its inverse transform uniquely corresponds to \\\\( e^{it} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
