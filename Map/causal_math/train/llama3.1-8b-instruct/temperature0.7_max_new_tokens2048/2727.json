  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its effect through an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter. We examine the behaviors of different functions and the impact of alterations to the integral transform.\n\nIf an intervention applies a modifier function \\\\(m(z) = z^2\\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) to \\\\(m(z)f(z)\\\\), will the transformed function \\\\(T[mf](s)\\\\) at s = a depend only on the original function f and not the modifier m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying by \\\\(m(z) = z^2\\\\) modifies the function to \\\\(mf(z) = z^2 \\\\frac{1}{z} = z\\\\), which changes the nature of the integrable function and consequently the integral transform results. The new transformation will not be solely dependent on \\\\(f(z)\\\\), but rather a combination of the effects of \\\\(m(z)\\\\) and \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
