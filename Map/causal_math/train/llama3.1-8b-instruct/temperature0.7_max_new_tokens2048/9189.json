  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system's states. The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is used for analysis.\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes an external force modification at t = 0, described by \\\\( z(0) = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\), and evolves under its inherent dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = s_0 be the same as if the signal had started from a different initial condition \\\\( z'(0) = x'_0 + iy'_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition significantly determines the Laplace transform of the function. Different initial states \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and \\\\( z'(0) \\\\) lead to different evolution paths, which in turn affect the complex plane and the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
