  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) a real number frequency parameter. The integral transform of this function with respect to time using the Laplace transform is analyzed.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is doubled from \\\\(\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(2\\omega\\\\) at time t = 0 and left unchanged, will the Laplace transform of the new function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i 2\\omega t}\\\\) at a later time T be equivalent to the Laplace transform of the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the frequency modifies the function fundamentally, affecting oscillation speed. Since Laplace transforms are sensitive to frequency changes, the result for \\\\(z(t) = e^{i 2\\omega t}\\\\) differs from that of \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\\\), specifically in the exponential term and the resultant frequency in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "doubling ω → change in z(t); change in z(t) → change in Laplace transform; doubling ω → change in ω; change in ω → change in Laplace transform"
