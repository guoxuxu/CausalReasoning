  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the complex initial condition. We evaluate how the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant, affects the evolution over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and it then evolves according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T equal \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\) as if \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition, resulting in a new starting point \\\\( z(0) = e^{D \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) but as it evolves, its trajectory changes due to the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) depending on \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Therefore, the trajectory and final state at time T are altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
