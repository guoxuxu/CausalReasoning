  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z \\) defined in the complex plane as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We study the effect of adding a linear transformation represented by \\( T(z) = az + b \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants) on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( U(z) \\), or both), solely based on the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex function and its transformations can yield similar outcomes from different parameters \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\), and \\( d \\) due to the inherent properties of complex additions and multiplications. This indeterminacy makes it impossible to uniquely identify the transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
