  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to examine the system behavior.\n\nAfter observing the system at time t = T, can we deduce the precise initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, and considering the integral effect of \\\\( e^{C\\\\tau} \\\\) on the system, it is impossible to uniquely trace back to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation alters the pathways potentially taken by the vector field.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
