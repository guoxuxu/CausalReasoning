  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( g(z) \\) defined on the complex plane as \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. The function is studied under the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\) which transforms \\( g(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex \\( s \\)-domain.\n\nGiven the resulting function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-e} \\) in the \\( s \\)-domain after the transformation, can the specific interventions (whether \\( g(t) \\), \\( h(t) \\), or both) be identified solely from \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\( H(s) \\) showing a pole at \\( s=e \\) cannot conclusively indicate whether it was a result of \\( c \\), \\( d \\), or a combination \\( c + d = e \\). This ambiguity arises because the algebraic properties of the exponential function blend the effects of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) without distinguishable traces in the resultant \\( H(s) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
