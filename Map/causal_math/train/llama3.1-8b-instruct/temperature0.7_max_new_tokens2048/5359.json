  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input that can be transformed using an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{F(s)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of a new input function. We study how transformations of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) affect the system's behavior.\n\nSuppose at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new control function transformation \\\\( u''(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{H(s)\\\\} \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the system's final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original input transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\), without the influence of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( u''(t) \\\\) further modifies the control input, affecting the future trajectory of the system. All transformations (\\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\)) collectively influence the system's final state at \\\\( T \\\\) due to their respective impacts during different intervals of the control process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
