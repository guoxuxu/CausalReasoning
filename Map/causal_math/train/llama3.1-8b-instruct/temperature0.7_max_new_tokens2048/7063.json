  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the continuous Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain signal. We analyze the impact of a modulation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another modulation \\\\( h(t) = e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a different constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final frequency spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}''(\\\\omega) \\\\) be a simple superposition of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) frequency shifts?",
  "Explanation": "Applying another modulation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) in sequence to the already modulated signal \\\\( f'(t) = f(t)e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) results in \\\\( f''(t) = f(t)e^{i(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)t} \\\\). Therefore, the frequency spectrum will reflect the collective shift, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega - (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)) \\\\), showing a superposed effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
