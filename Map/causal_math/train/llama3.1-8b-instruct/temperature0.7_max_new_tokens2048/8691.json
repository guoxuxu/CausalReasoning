  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iB\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) applied at time t, with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention at t = T, does the final state at T+Δt depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at t = T with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) further changes the state by applying another matrix exponential, which can interact non-trivially with the effects of A and B. The final state at T+Δt is influenced by all three matrices, A, B, and C, because of the complex interplay between the exponential actions and the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
