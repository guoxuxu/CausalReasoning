  "Problem": "Consider the problem of heat distribution over a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion constant and u(x, t) represents the temperature. An integral transformation using the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) is applied to investigate the solution's behavior.\n\nGiven the final Fourier-transformed state \\\\( F(u)(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), can one unequivocally determine whether any interventions (like additional heat sources) were applied or deduce the nature of such interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of interventions can lead to similar if not identical results at time T, especially given the integral and diffusive nature of the heat equation. The loss of information and the potential overlap in the effects of different types of interventions (due to diffusion smoothing effects) make it impossible to specifically determine the nature or existence of interventions just by inspecting the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
