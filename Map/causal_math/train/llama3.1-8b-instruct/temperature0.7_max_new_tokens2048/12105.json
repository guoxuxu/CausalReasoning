  "Problem": "Analyze a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. The system's state is manipulated by a transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\), where D is a matrix. The manipulation occurs over time t and has implications for the evolution of the state.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied, deducing the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is uncertain. The transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could have modified the initial conditions in a way that cannot be easily reversed, especially since D and L may not have symmetric properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
