  "Problem": "Examine the calculation of the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( u(t) = t^2 \\\\) which is then convolved with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t} \\\\). The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transformation used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems responses.\n\nIf an additional scaling factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is applied during the calculation of the convolution's Laplace transform, does it still equate to the simple product of the individual transforms of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional exponential factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) modifies the original functions within the convolution integral, leading to a Laplace transform that is not merely the product of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v\\\\} \\\\). The convolution theorem cannot be applied straightforwardly in this modified scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
