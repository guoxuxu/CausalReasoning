  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop feedback system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) is the control input. We are examining the system's behavior under the integral transformation given by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(K+L)s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\).\n\nCan the initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be identified uniquely from the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T knowing the system possibly underwent transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of whether or not the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied, the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) may not be inferrable due to the multiple potential trajectories dependent on whether the integral transform was used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
