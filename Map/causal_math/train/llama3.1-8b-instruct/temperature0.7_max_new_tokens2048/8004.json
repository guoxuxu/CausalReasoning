  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation under various conditions. We analyze the impact of a non-linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(v) = \\\\sinh(kv) \\\\) where k is a constant, on the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) of the fluid.\n\nGiven the observed velocity profile \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\), can we identify which transformations or interventions (\\\\( g(v), h(v) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the characteristics of \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) could potentially be the result of various combinations of transformations and interventions. The non-linearity and interaction between \\\\( g(v) \\\\) and \\\\( h(v) \\\\), along with the fluid dynamics, make it impossible to conclusively identify or isolate the actions taken at earlier times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
