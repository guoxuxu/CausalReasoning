  "Problem": "Consider a control system represented by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a control input. Analyze the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on this system.\n\nIf \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is a step function applied at t = 0, and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(x_0\\\\) was evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without a control input?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) fundamentally alters the system's response, which is reflected in the altered Laplace transform. The term involving \\\\(N\\\\) and the step function will add components to the transform that are not there if the system evolves only under \\\\(M\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
