  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Sx} \\\\) where S is a constant matrix, used to solve the complex function equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}z = Pz \\\\), with P as another constant matrix. The effect of transformations using additional operator \\\\( T(x) = e^{Qx} \\\\) over variable x, where Q is also a constant matrix, is studied.\n\nIf at x = x_1, an intervention \\\\( U(x) = e^{Rx} \\\\) (with R a constant matrix) is applied, will the state of \\\\( z(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 depend only on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( U(x) \\\\) adds another factor influencing the evolution whereby the final state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) depends on the interactions between Q, R, and P. The interplay of the different matrix exponentials can significantly alter the trajectory and consequently the final state at x = X.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
