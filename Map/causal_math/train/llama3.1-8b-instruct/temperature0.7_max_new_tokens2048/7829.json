  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation describing heat transfer \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We study the impact of applying a Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) alters the representation of the initial condition into the frequency domain. The heat equation solved in the frequency domain leads to different dynamics compared to the spatial domain solution unless inverse transformed back exactly without any loss of information or modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
