  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real function of time t and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax(t) \\\\), with A being a real constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine if the intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), only by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied and the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) adaptations and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) values can yield similar outputs in complex functions, due to the interaction of phase shifts and real function modifications, making it difficult to disentangle one effect from another accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
