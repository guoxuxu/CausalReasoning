  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. The transformation of this function under a Laplace transform is investigated.\n\nCan the matrix A be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = (sI - A)^{-1} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), the matrix A can be uniquely identified as it is the only matrix that satisfies the relationship \\\\( F(s) = (sI - A)^{-1} \\\\). The complexity of solving for A depends on the structure of matrix A but in principle, it can be recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
