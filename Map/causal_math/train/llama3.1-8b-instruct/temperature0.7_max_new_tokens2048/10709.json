  "Problem": "Consider two functions \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\) within the context of complex function theory. We explore their impact when applied to complex numbers and analyze their transformations through integral transformations involving the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( L \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then \\\\( L \\\\) are sequentially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), does the resultant transformation equate to directly applying \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without first squaring \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) first modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) which alters the characteristics of the function being transformed by \\\\( L \\\\). Therefore, the outcome of \\\\( L(f(z_0)) \\\\) is different from applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly to the unaltered \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This result is due to the specific transformation properties of the Laplace transform over non-linear transformations of its input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
