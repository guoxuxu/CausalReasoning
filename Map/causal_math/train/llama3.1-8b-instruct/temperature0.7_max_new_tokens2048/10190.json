  "Problem": "Investigate a control system where the growth rate of a population \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = r y(t) \\\\), with r being a growth constant. An intervention is performed using a function \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), where k is another constant, to modify the instantaneous growth rate at a specific time point.\n\nGiven the population at time t = T as \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine the initial population \\\\( y_0 \\\\) without knowing if any interventions were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of intervention, one cannot conclusively deduce \\\\( y_0 \\\\) since the exponential growth could be altered by intervening factors like \\\\( h(y) = y^k \\\\), which change the trajectory different from the natural exponential growth.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
