  "Problem": "Consider a curved surface in the 3D space described by the equation \\( z = f(x,y) \\). We explore the effect of multiple complex transformations on this surface. Specifically, we look at transformations represented by \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) where C is a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the final observed surface at time \\( T \\), is it possible to determine which transformations were applied at different stages (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both), solely by examining the surface at \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping potential effects of exponential and linear transformations on the surface make it difficult to trace back uniquely to the types and sequences of interventions solely from the final state. The interplay between \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) creates an array of possible surfaces that can result in the same observed endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
