  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral in the complex plane. We will evaluate the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt}dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed path and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number parameter. The analysis is affected by transformations using the function \\\\( f(z) = z^{2} + a \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nAfter computing \\\\( I \\\\) for given \\\\( t \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), is it possible to infer the original configuration of \\\\( C \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any changes to the contour that could vary the integral's value (such as transformations or modifications of residue locations) cannot be conclusively reversed. Multiple different contours could result in the same integral value, especially under transformation ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
