  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\(z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) for a constant matrix A. This function is subjected to various transformations and the responses are observed over the path \\\\(z(t) = z_0 + vt\\\\) where \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant vector and \\\\(t\\\\) represents time.\n\nGiven the final state observed at \\\\(f(z(T))\\\\), can one ascertain definitively the exact nature of the interventions (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied, and if so, when), given A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential nature of the transformations makes it difficult to reverse engineer the system completely to understand the precise interventions like the timing or the specific application of \\\\(g(z)\\\\), especially since \\\\\\(e^{Az} \\\\\\) and \\\\\\(e^{Bz}\\\\\\ ) might have non-exclusive effects depending on their algebraic properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
