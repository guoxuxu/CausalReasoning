  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effects of applying Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as its inverse and interactions due to various potential modifications.\n\nGiven the output from an inverse Laplace Transform, can we determine precisely the original function and any intermediate operations performed in the s-domain, like multiplication by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the original function and any operations such as multiplication by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) from the final inverse-transformed output alone is generally not possible without additional information. The final form can result from various combinations of original functions and transformations in the s-domain, thus specific interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
