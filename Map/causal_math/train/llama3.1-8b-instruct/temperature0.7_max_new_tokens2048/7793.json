  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Let's explore the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\), on this system over a period of time t. Analyze how the inverse transform interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x(0) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform and the result \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is modified by a function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and then inverse transformed back to the time domain without other intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the state if \\\\( x(0) \\\\) was simply evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and then inverse transforming back affects the initial conditions seen by the differential system. This modification alters the solution path fundamentally, resulting in a different state at any time t, including T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
