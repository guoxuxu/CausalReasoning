  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit characterized by its complex impedance \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + R \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is the resistance, \\\\( C \\\\) is the capacitance, and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable from the Laplace transform. We explore the effects when the input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is transformed by a function \\\\( f(V) = e^{at}V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf the transformed input voltage \\\\( f(V) \\\\) is applied, and the circuit is allowed to respond naturally without further interventions, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to the scenario where the original \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is applied directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(V) = e^{at}V(t) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the voltage input. The transformation by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) inherently changes the frequency content of \\\\( V(t) \\\\), and thus the response \\\\( I(t) \\\\) governed by the impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) also changes. The presence of the exponential function introduces an additional exponential decay or growth factor, depending on the sign of \\\\( a \\\\), which significantly alters the time response of the current.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
