  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and this function is applied in a complex analysis setting. We explore the role of a contour integral transformation of this function over a closed path in the complex plane.\n\nIf midway through tracing the contour C, the integral path is altered by an intervention changing the path to encircle the point z=0, does this guarantee the integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) will differ from zero?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the contour to enclose z=0 does not alter the outcome because \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) remains free of singularities and branch cuts, ensuring that the Residue Theorem still results in an integral of zero, regardless of whether z=0 is encircled.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
