  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. We explore the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) on these components separately and together.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = L[z(t)] \\\\), can we determine the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) separately by using the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of a complex function can be split into its real and imaginary parts, we can use the inverse Laplace transform on both \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(Z(s)) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\text{Im}(Z(s)) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), respectively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
