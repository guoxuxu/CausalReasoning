  "Problem": "Let us analyze a control system represented by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( u \\\\) is an input signal. We consider the implications of applying a Laplace transform to the system, defined as \\\\( L[x](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), and then manipulating the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) by observing the transformed state \\\\( L[x](s) \\\\) without knowledge of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge regarding any potential modifications to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) during the evolution, as well as the complexity introduced by adding \\( Nu \\) to \\( Mx \\), makes it impossible to uniquely backtrack from \\\\( L[x](s) \\\\) to the exact form of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
