  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a vibrating string given by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the speed of the wave in the string and \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). An external forcing term \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is added to the system, resulting in a modified equation \\\\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + F(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system starts with an initial displacement \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and no initial velocity, and evolves according to the modified equation with \\\\( F(x,t) = 0 \\\\) at all times, will the displacement \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at any later time T be the same as if no force had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the force \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is zero across all time, it does not contribute to the system's dynamics. Thus, the string's behavior only depends on its natural properties described by the wave equation without the force, leading to the same displacement as if no force were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
