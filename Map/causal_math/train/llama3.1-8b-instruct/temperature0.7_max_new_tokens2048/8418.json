  "Problem": "Examine the linear system driven by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. Consider the complex function transformation \\\\(h(x) = S \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)x\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without the knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied initially, and considering the effect of the matrix \\\\(S\\\\) which could have altered the initial conditions, it is impossible to uniquely infer the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same final state due to the transformation's effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
