  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = A x + B u\\\\), with A being the system matrix and B the input matrix. The input \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of time and defined by an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) x(s) ds \\\\), where K is a kernel matrix function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the kernel function \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is changed to a new matrix \\\\( L(s) \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend solely on the system matrix A and not on changes in \\\\( K \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( K(s) \\\\) to \\\\( L(s) \\\\) represents an intervention that alters the input \\\\( u \\\\) and consequently the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The system’s evolution becomes dependent on the nature and structure of both \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\), besides just A, which influences the trajectory and final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the kernel function K to L at time t1 does not affect the system's final state x(T) due to the system's inherent feedback loop, as the state x is ultimately determined by the system matrix A."
