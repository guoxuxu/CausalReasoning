  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions describing a physical system. We investigate a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency, applied to this system over time \\( t \\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\) (with \\( \\theta \\) as another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on \\( \\lambda \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\theta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the additional intervention \\( g(z) \\), the final state \\( z(T) \\) at time T will deviate from being solely dependent on \\( \\lambda \\), influenced by both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\). These transformations introduce complex rotations and scaling to the trajectory, impacting the resulting state at \\( z(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
