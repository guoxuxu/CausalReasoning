  "Problem": "Consider a context where z is a complex function of a real variable x, written as z(x) = u(x) + iv(x) where u and v are real-valued functions of x. We study the effects and causes considering the integral transformation T defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain interval [a, b], z(x) is modified to p(x), a polynomial function, as an intervention, will T(z)(x) reflect these changes distinctly and only these changes?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation T(z) blends the impact of all parts of z across the domain [0, infinity], making it difficult to distinctly identify changes made only within a specific interval. The contributions of changes in [a, b] will be integrated with all other parts of z, and the exponential decay factor might reduce their visibility in T(z).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
