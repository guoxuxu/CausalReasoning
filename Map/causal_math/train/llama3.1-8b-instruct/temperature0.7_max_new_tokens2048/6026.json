  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, in relation to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( T \\\\), can the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely identified without knowing whether any external transformation like \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) results in an integral that mixes the effects of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), modifying the lineage of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without information on the applied transformations, recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is indeterminate, as equivalent results could be constructed from different initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
