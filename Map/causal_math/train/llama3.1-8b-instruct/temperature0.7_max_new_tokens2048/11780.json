  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Rt} \\\\), where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( T \\\\) under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, which in turn affects the entire trajectory of the system. The exponential factor \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\) introduces a multiplying effect that alters the growth pattern and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a distinctive state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
