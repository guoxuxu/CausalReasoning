  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) is a time-dependent input signal and \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. The dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) in the system are described by a complex function \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear transformation.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\( z(t) \\), \\( q(t) \\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) could result from different combinations or sequences of transformations due to the interplay of complex exponential terms and the linear dynamics. Various combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\) could lead to the same observed endpoint \\( z(T) \\), making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific interventions made without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
