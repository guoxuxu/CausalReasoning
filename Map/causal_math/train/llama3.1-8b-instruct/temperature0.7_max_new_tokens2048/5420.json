  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B\\\\overline{z}\\\\), where A and B are constants and \\\\(\\\\overline{z}\\\\) represents the complex conjugate of z. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is also a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, knowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might be achieved through various combinations or sequences of transformations, each interacting uniquely with the complex dynamics of the differential equation. This overlap in potential impacts and pathways makes it impossible to uniquely determine the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
