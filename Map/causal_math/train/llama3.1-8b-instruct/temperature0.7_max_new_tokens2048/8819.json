  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system described by a Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) defined as \\\\(f(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds\\\\). The scenario explores how manipulations to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) affect the outcome of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( g(s) \\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\( s_0 \\\\) by introducing a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\lambda s} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\lambda > 0 \\\\), will this change be evident in \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping exponential factor at a specific frequency modifies the spectrum of \\\\( g(s) \\\\) resulting in an altered transformation that affects both the amplitude decay and phase shift of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) related to that frequency. This change is visible in the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
