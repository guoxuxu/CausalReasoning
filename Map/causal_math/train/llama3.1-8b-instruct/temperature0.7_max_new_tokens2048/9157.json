  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time under the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) for a matrix C.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces an integration of the state over time, affected by \\\\( e^{C\\\\tau} \\\\), which significantly alters the trajectory of both x and y components from their paths under just \\\\( Ax \\\\) and \\\\( By \\\\). The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is therefore a modified due to the accumulated effect of \\\\( e^{C\\\\tau} \\\\) on the evolution of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
