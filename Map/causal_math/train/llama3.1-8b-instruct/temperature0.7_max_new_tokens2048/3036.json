  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven a bounded value of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) after some transformations, can we conclusively identify the original \\\\( z \\\\) or the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "While transformations that increase the real part of \\\\( z \\\\) result in bounded \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the specific original value of \\\\( z \\\\) or the transformations made cannot be uniquely determined from the boundedness alone due to potential multiple transformations achieving the same effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s → h(z); z → h(z); h(z) → bounded; bounded → conclusive identification"
