  "Problem": "We analyze a mechanical system where the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mass evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\), a simple harmonic oscillator, where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. We introduce transformations via \\( f(x) = A \\sin(Bx) \\) at different instances to investigate causal influences.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( g(x) = C \\cos(Dx) \\) is applied, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on the original differential equation (\\( -kx \\)) parameters and not on \\( A, B, C, \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) introduces yet another alteration to the state of the system. This change in conditions impacts the trajectory and final state \\( x(T) \\) in a manner dependent on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), in addition to the transformations made by \\( f(x) \\). The final state \\( x(T) \\) thus depends on these interventions in conjunction with the original system parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
