  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we determine precisely what interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied by solely analyzing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the type and sequence of interventions based only on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible without additional constraints or data; since different combinations of A, B, C, and D (and their interactions over time) could yield equivocal endpoint outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
