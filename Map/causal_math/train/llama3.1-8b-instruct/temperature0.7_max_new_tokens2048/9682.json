  "Problem": "Consider a functional analysis setting where we analyze the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), denoted by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). We examine how the application of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) which translates functions in time by a constant \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) affects the Laplace transform and its interpretation.\n\nGiven a transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and observing its translated form \\\\( e^{-as}H(s) \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without knowing the translation parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined without precise knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) since the factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) affects the output of the Laplace transform, thereby requiring knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) to reverse the translation effect correctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
