  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) (where \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency) applied to a signal transformation described by the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{s(t)\\\\} = S(\\\\omega) \\\\). We examine the impact of modifying the frequency component by multiplying the original signal by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed spectrum \\\\( S''(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence or types of frequency modulations used (\\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( S''(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final spectrum \\\\( S''(\\\\omega) \\\\) could result from various combinations of frequency shifts due to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), possibly over different intervals or with different frequency parameters. The resulting shifts could overlap or counteract each other, making it impossible to uniquely reverse-engineer the exact nature and order of interventions only from the spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
