  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then \\( f(z) \\) is computed without further intervention, does \\( f(g(z_0)) \\) at \\( t = T \\) equal \\( f(z_0) \\) computed directly at \\( t = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) alters the input to \\( f(z) \\), and because the integral transformation in \\( f(z) \\) depends non-linearly on its input due to the exponentiation \\( z^t \\), the output \\( f(g(z_0)) \\) will generally not equal \\( f(z_0) \\). The nature of both transformations involves complex exponentials, making their combined effect not straightforward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
