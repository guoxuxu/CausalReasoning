  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system evolves over time t and undergoes an integral transform using the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform result \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of some function at s = \\\\( \\\\omega + i\\\\beta \\\\), can we unequivocally assert that the original function involved a term of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the term \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) among others in the Laplace Transform does not guarantee that the original function was strictly \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\); it might also contain other frequency components or be affected by additional terms not discernible from just one point evaluation of \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
