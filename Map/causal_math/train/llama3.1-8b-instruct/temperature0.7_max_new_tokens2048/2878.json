  "Problem": "Consider the role of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the position of a particle in a two-dimensional space. This function is subjected to a transformation using a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We study the impact of this transformation and potential interventions on the system.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of the initial function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any initial time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) after observing its Fourier transform \\\\(F(z)(\\\\omega)\\\\) without knowing additional properties of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier inversion theorem allows us to reconstruct the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its Fourier transform under the condition that \\\\(z(t)\\\\) satisfies certain properties such as integrability. Therefore, we can deduce the exact initial state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(z)(\\\\omega)\\\\), provided no additional transformations or losses in information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
