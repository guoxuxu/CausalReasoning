  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original time-domain function and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is its transformation in the s-domain. We examine the system's response when subject to an operator \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nAfter observing the transformed system's response \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without knowing whether the operator \\\\( G(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or its specific parameter \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to accurately deduce \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) might shift or alter the original function in a manner that is not reversible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
