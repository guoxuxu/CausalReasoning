  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nGiven the endpoint value of \\\\( I' = \\\\int_{g(w(C))} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) after applying both transformations, can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( w(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were applied, only knowing \\\\( I' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific transformations basely solely on the final integral value \\\\( I' \\\\) is challenging due to the non-invertible nature of general complex exponential functions in this context and the possibility of multiple transformation pairs resulting in the same modified contour.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
