  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, represented by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nAfter computing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can the original function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) at \\\\( w = w_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Given that Fourier transforms (a type of integral transform) are invertible under certain conditions, knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) allows for the recovery of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier transform, assuming the sufficient conditions for invertibility are satisfied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
