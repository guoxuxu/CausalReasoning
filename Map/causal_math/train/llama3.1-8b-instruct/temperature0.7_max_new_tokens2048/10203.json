  "Problem": "We examine the impact of a complex transformation given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w(z) = e^{i\\pi z} \\\\) on the real and imaginary components of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\dot{y} = x \\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( v(z) = z + 2 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the original differential equations and not on the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( v(z) = z + 2 \\\\) also affects the trajectory by directly altering the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\), the natural evolution through the differential equations, and the intervention applied. This makes the trajectory dependent on all applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
