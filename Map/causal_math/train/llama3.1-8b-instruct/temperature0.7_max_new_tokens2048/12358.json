  "Problem": "Analyze the causal interactions in a system where a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time) undergoes a Laplace transform to generate complex function \\\\( Z(s) = U(s) + iV(s) \\\\). We study the effects and the capability to reverse this transformation.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say a convolution with a function \\\\( w(t) \\\\), is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, does the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) solely depend on the original \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without accounting for \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution operation introduces a modification represented as a product in the Laplace domain, which means \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will represent the transformations due to both the original function and the convolution with \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
