  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\) describing the trajectory of a particle in the complex plane, where \\\\( R(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the radial and angular components, respectively. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of phase shifts introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), including their different magnitudes and timings. The non-linear interactions between these transformations make it challenging to ascertain the exact interventions used based solely on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
