  "Problem": "Consider a circuit system described by the integral \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-sA} x(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix that represents system parameters and \\( x(t) \\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the input signal using a transformation defined by \\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x \\), where \\( B \\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention \\( g(x) = e^{Ct}x \\) (where \\( C \\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), will the resulting output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) both modulate the input signal at different instances, leading to a composition of effects from \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) alongside the systematic influence of \\( A \\). The cumulative effects of these transformations on the input signal make the output \\( y(T) \\) dependent not only on \\( A \\) but also significantly on \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
