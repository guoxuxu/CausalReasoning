  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing the transformation \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) at time T without knowing intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linearity and time-invariance of the PDE, and that the Fourier transform is invertible, we can apply the inverse transformation to \\\\( T(u(x, T)) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and solve the PDE backwards to find \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
