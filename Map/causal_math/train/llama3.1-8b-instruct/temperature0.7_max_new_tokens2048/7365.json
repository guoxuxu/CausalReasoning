  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation of the form \\\\( y(x) = \\int_0^x K(x, t) y(t) dt + f(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a known function. We analyze the changes in function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) when a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) characterized by operator \\\\( L[y] = y + g \\\\), where \\\\( g \\\\) is an additional function, is applied to the integral equation.\n\nIf the function \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the integral equation at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\), changing the initial condition of the integral equation, will the solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) at a later point \\\\( x = T \\\\) be identical to the solution had \\\\( L \\\\) not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) alters the initial part of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) adding \\\\( g \\\\) into the integral equation, thereby altering the entire trajectory of the solution \\\\( y(x) \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T due to the dependencies in the integral equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
