  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where F(s) represents the transformed complex function. We explore the impact of modifying the function to \\\\( f(t) + tg(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is another function, on the Laplace transform over variable s.\n\nIf an intervention changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a certain time during the transformation process, will the final form of \\\\( L\\\\{f(t) + th(t)\\\\} \\\\) still reflect the change from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), assuming no changes to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Any modification in \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) directly affects the term \\\\( L\\\\{th(t)\\\\} \\\\). The Laplace transform will reflect this intervention due to its dependence on the precise form of the function being transformed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
