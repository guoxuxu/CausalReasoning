  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We study the role of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Ce^{Bt}z \\\\), where B and C are also complex matrices.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( h(z) = De^{Ft}z \\\\) (where D and F are constant matrices) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by A and not be affected by the transformations induced by B, C, or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces additional dynamics into the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only depends on the matrix A but is also significantly influenced by the matrices B, C, and F via their exponential actions, implying dependency across all these parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
