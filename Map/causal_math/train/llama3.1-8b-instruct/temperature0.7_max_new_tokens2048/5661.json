  "Problem": "We explore the impact of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Here, \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and we define it as \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. The differential operator serves as an integral transformation of the function, possibly altering its domain and behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( g(x) = sin(x) \\\\) and is allowed to transform without further intervention, will the transformed function remain equivalent to the original \\\\( g(x) \\\\) in the transformation's domain?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) = sin(x) \\\\) transforms it into a function in the complex plane, specifically \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \\\\). This is not equivalent to the original trigonometric function, indicating a fundamental transformation in domain and functional expression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
