  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the original time domain function. Investigate the effect of inverse Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))(t) \\\\) and the influence of multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) in the s-domain on this relationship.\n\nIf an original function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) by Laplace transformation and then converted back to the time domain by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))(t) \\\\) without any other changes, will the final function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) remain unchanged from the original?",
  "Explanation": "The process of applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse transformation, in theoretical conditions without loss or modification, ideally reconstructs the original function \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Thus, the function remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
