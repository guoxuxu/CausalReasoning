  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a region R with boundary condition specified by \\\\( u(x,0) = x^2 \\\\). The impact of applying a transformation described by multi-dimensional Fourier transform \\\\( F(u(x,y)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x,y) e^{-i2\\\\pi xy} dx dy \\\\) on the function is examined.\n\nIf a corrective transformation, say an inverse Fourier transform, is applied at some y = Y > 0, will the resulting system solution for y > Y ignore the initial application of the Fourier transform and only reflect the effect of Laplace's equation from the original boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Even after applying an inverse transform to mitigate the initial Fourier transformation, the intermediary state of the system at y = Y will affect subsequent solutions. The system's state at y = Y, carrying imprints of the original Fourier transformation, becomes the new 'initial condition' for further evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
