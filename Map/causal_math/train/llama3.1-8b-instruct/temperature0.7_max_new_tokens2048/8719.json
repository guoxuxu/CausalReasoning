  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices, and x is the initial condition. We examine the effects of an input transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( k(x) = Fx \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the matrices A and C, independent of matrices D and F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x) = Fx \\\\) adds another level of complexity, modifying the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) which then continues to evolve according to \\\\( Ce^{A(T-t_1)} \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by how D and F interact with the dynamics defined by A, making the outcome dependent not only on A and C but also on D and F.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
