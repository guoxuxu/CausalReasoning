  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined on the real axis, \\\\( u(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is transformed using the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform without any adjustments, will the transformed function only depend on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the variable s?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), which clearly depends on both the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\). The transformation thus inherently involves \\\\( s \\\\) determining the decay rate and stability of the inverse transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
