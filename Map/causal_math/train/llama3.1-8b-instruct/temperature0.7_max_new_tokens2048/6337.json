  "Problem": "Let's analyze a scenario involving the Laplace transform in the context of signal processing. The initial signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is given, and its transformation through the Laplace transform is considered as \\\\( S(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s(t))(s) \\\\). Various manipulations and operations are applied to study the causal relationships between transformations and signals.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( S(s) \\\\) of the initial signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) is manipulated algebraically without applying any additional transforms, will the inverse Laplace transform result in the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "As long as no additional transformations are applied and only algebraic manipulations (like simplification or rearrangement) are performed on \\\\( S(s) \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform will perfectly recover the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) without alteration, ensuring causality is preserved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
