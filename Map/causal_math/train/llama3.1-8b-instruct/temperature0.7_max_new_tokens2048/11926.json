  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nIf another intervention \\\\( g(T) = T - c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant cooling effect) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the initial temperature without considering the effects of \\\\( h \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations \\\\( f(T) \\\\) and \\\\( g(T) \\\\) influences the thermal trajectory. Both interventions change the baseline from which the temperature adjusts towards \\\\( T_{env} \\\\). As such, the final temperature depends on both the original temperature and the alterations made by \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
