  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We analyze how this function transforms through the integral \\\\( g(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{As} ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf an intervention using a different function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt} dt \\\\) (where B is a different constant matrix) is applied at some time t1 within [0, T], will the final output at T independently reflect only the effects of A, not influenced by B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) changes the overall system dynamics by introducing a new matrix B in the exponential. The final output at T is a result of the compounded effects of both A and B due to their respective transformations encoded through the integral. The cumulative effect can't be attributed to A alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → e^(As); e^(As) → ∫_0^T e^(As) ds; ∫_0^T e^(As) ds → f(z); h(t) → ∫_0^T e^(Bt) dt; ∫_0^T e^(Bt) dt → g(t) if t < t1; t1 → intervention; intervention → g(t) if t ≥ t1"
