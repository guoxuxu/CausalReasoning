  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function is evaluated and then transformed using the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\). The system's behavior over the complex plane is considered under this transformation.\n\nGiven a modified Fourier transformed output after changing \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( B \\\\) mid-transformation, can we clearly identify whether the intervention occurred and what the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) were without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform results amalgamate the effects of both matrices, and without explicit timestamps or knowledge about when the intervention occurred or what specific characteristics each matrix imparts, it is not feasible to distinctly determine both the occurrence and nature of the intervention as well as the exact matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modified Fourier transformed output → A change in system behavior; A → System behavior; B → System behavior; A change in system behavior → Intervention occurred; B → A change in system behavior"
