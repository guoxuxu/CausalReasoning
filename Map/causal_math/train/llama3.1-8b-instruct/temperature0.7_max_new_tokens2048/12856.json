  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x,t=0) \\\\) is transformed by the Fourier transform to \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t=0) \\\\) and then evolved over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\kappa k^2 \\\\hat{u}\\\\), will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) reflect the correct temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) after an inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The propagation of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) via the transformed differential equation appropriately models the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) under heat conduction, and transforming it back correctly reflects the temperature distribution at any given time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
