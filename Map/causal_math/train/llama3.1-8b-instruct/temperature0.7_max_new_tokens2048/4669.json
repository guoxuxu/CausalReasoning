  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real-valued parameter. We explore different transformations including the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional modifications, will \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) for s=i (the imaginary unit) yield the same result as the original function \\(\\int_0^\\infty e^{-it} e^{it} \\, dt\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and the integral of the original function differ fundamentally. The Laplace transform \\(\\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{it} \\, dt\\) results in a function of s, while the integral of the original function technically diverges as it tries to evaluate \\(\\int_0^\\infty 1 \\, dt\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
