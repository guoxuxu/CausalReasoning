  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} x \\\\) defining a rotation in the complex plane, where A is a real constant matrix and x is a complex vector. We investigate how time-dependent transformations \\\\( f(t, z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with B also a constant matrix, influence the system's evolution.\n\nCan we determine precisely what interventions were applied, i.e., whether \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\), \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\), or both, based solely on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the exact history of interventions cannot be ascertained definitively. The resulting state at time T could be due to several potential sequences of rotations induced by B or C, singly or in combination. The overlapping rotational influences of these matrices make it impossible to pinpoint the interventions used solely based on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
