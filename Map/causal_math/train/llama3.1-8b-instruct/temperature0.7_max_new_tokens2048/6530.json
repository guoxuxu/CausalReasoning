  "Problem": "Analyze a feedback system involving the complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to the initial input \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and is continuously re-applied to its own output in a feedback loop. Additionally, explore how the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) influences the system over time.\n\nGiven the final observed state of the system as \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\) where \\\\( z(\\\\infty) \\\\) is nearly constant and assuming |c|<1, can we deduce accurately the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "While the system converges to a stable point, without knowing the exact dynamics (how many iterations or specific effects of compounding transformations), retroactively computing the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the final state is not straightforward. Inherent transformations through the feedback loop might lose information about the initial state as they converge to the fixed point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
