  "Problem": "Evaluate how the Laplace Transform impacts the causality between a pair of functions \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), where \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is its derivative using the relation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\nIf \\( u(t) = 2t \\) undergoes a linear transformation by a matrix \\( A \\) before its Laplace Transform is computed, does \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) only reflect the properties of matrix \\( A \\) without relating to the original \\( v(t) = t^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) will still inherently carry information about the original function \\( v(t) \\) because it's derived from \\( u(t) \\), reflecting the derivatives of \\( v(t) \\). The matrix \\( A \\) conditions the output but doesn't isolate \\( v(t)'s \\) influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
