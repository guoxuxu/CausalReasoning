  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the stability of a linear system defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowing it resulted from a system defined by \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was multiplied by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not uniquely confirm the initial multiplication by \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), as the influence of A and the exponential complex factor both affect the trajectory. Without additional information about phase changes or specific interactions between A and the exponential terms, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone is insufficient for determining initial modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
