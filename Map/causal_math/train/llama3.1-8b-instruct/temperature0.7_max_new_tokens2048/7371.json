  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the behavior of the system under the influence of a linear transformation \\( h(x) = Mx \\), where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf a new operation \\( j(x) = Nx \\) (where N is another transformation matrix) is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), will the system's state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( D \\) and not on \\( M \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent intervention with \\( j(x) \\) introduces another layer of transformation, making the final state \\( x(T) \\) contingent on \\( M \\), \\( N \\), and \\( D \\). The combined effects of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) through the transformation sequence affect how the system evolves to the state \\( x(T) \\), showing dependency beyond just \\( D \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
