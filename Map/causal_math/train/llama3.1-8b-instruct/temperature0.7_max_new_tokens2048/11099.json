  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the effect of an integral transform \\\\( g(u) = \\\\int e^{-tx} u(x) dx \\\\) over the input function u.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another integral transform \\\\( h(u) = \\\\int k(t,x) u(x) dx \\\\) (where k is a kernel function) is applied as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on L and not on the specifics of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) introduces additional alteration based on the kernel k, which affects the function. Thus, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) depends on L as well as the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\), each contributing uniquely to the resulting state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
