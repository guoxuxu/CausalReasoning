  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The evolution of this function over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex-valued matrix. Study the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a complex matrix.\n\nCan the starting complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be reconstructed from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If it is not known whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately is uncertain because the transformation \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) might have altered original conditions uniquely related to the interactions between \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
