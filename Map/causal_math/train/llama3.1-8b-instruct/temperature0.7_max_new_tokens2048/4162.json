  "Problem": "Considering a controlled experiment involving the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a system of differential equations with matrices M and N respectively: \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\). The experiment examines the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), where K is a constant scalar, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it would have induced an initial rotation in \\\\( z_0 \\\\), making it challenging to revert to the correct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just by knowing the matrices M and N and observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The effect of \\\\( e^{iKt} \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could not be reversed accurately without knowledge about K.",
