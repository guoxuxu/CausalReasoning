  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the final state \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( z \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) is uniquely invertible to \\\\( w = \\log(z) \\\\), and the evolution under the given differential equation is deterministically reversible by solving it backward, \\\\( w(T) \\\\) can be traced back uniquely to \\\\( w_0 \\\\). With knowledge of \\\\( z(w(T)) \\\\), \\\\( w_0 \\\\) can be determined regardless of when \\\\( z \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
