  "Problem": "In this setting, we analyze the behavior of a function z(t) defined in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Bw \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T, can we uniquely determine the initial state of \\\\( w_0 \\\\) not knowing whether the transformation was applied initially or during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of when or whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\) was applied, multiple initial values and dynamics (i.e., different values of B or different transformation times) might yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This non-uniqueness arises because the transformation effects cannot be easily separated from the intrinsic evolution due to \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
