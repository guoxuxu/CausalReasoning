  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant frequency. To analyze this, a transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\phi(z) =  \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t)z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is also a real constant, is applied at various times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( \\\\psi(z) = \\\\exp(-i\\\\theta t)z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\psi(z) \\\\) contributes an additional phase shift that counteracts or complements the original transformation, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). The two phase effects may not cancel out completely, especially if timed differently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
