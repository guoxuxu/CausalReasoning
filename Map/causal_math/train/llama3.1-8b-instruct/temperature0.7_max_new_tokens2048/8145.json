  "Problem": "Consider a linear system subject to the equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where D is a constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of applying the transformation \\( T(x) = Lx \\) where \\( L \\) is a linear map represented by a constant matrix, and examining the behavior over a duration \\( t \\).\n\nIf \\( T(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\( x_0 \\) under \\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(x) \\) modifies the initial condition by \\( Lx_0 \\), which influences how the state evolves under \\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\). The transformation \\( L \\) can alter the trajectory and final state at time \\( T \\), dependent on the nature of \\( L \\) relative to \\( D \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
