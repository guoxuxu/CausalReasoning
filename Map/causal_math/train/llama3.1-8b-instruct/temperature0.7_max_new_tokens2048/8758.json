  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system is defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied to the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output values \\\\( u(T) \\\\) and \\\\( v(T) \\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally revert these values to their initial transformed states \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(s) \\\\) without knowing the precise forms of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of A and B, the matrices governing the differential equations, it isn't possible to uniquely determine the initial transformed states from the final values. The matrices dictate exponentially scaled effects peculiar to their eigenvalues and eigenvectors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
