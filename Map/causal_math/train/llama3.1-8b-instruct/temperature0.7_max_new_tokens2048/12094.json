  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which relates a function in the time domain to its counterpart in the complex, frequency domain. We examine scenarios where transformations such as filtering by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) are applied, and interventions by changing the function's form.\n\nIf an additional transformation by another filter \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) at a specific point in time resulting in \\\\( M(s) = K(s)G(s) \\\\), will the inverse transform \\\\( m(t) \\\\) rely solely on the original function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) filtered by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), devoid of the effects of \\\\( K(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation by \\\\( K(s) \\\\) influences the endpoint \\\\( m(t) \\\\), as it modifies \\\\( G(s) \\\\) additionally in the frequency domain. The resultant time domain function \\\\( m(t) \\\\) is the convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the impulse response of \\\\( K(s) \\\\), not merely a transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) filtered solely by \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
