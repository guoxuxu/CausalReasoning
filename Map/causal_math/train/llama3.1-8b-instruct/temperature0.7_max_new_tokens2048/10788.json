  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with M being a linear operator. An external force applies a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + k\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)z \\\\), where k and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, acting on the state vector \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it underwent transformations by both \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and \\\\(j(z)\\\\), can we determine which function was applied first or the values of k and d?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be influenced by the sequence of applications and their respective parameters in a non-trivial way, making it impossible to analytically deduce the order or the exact values of k and d from the final state alone, particularly due to possible phase cancellations and the superposition principle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
