  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\), where k is a complex constant, and its response to the Laplace transform deformations described by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transformation without any manipulation at initial time or during its transformation, will the result \\\\( L(z) \\\\) depend solely on the parameter k?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform directly translates the dynamical behavior of \\\\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\\\) into the s-domain without intervention. Since k defines the frequency and growth rates of the function, the resulting transform \\\\( L(z) \\\\) will specifically reflect changes only caused by k, generating \\\\( L(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-ik} \\\\) assuming real part of s is greater than the real part of ik.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
