  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an operation (such as multiplication by a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\)) is applied in the frequency domain, will the function recovered at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a frequency domain operation such as multiplication by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the spectral components of the function. Therefore, the function recovered at any later time by inverse Fourier transforming the transformed data will reflect these modifications, hence depending not only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also on the nature of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
