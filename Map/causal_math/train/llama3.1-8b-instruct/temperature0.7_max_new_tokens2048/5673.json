  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation using a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). This transformed signal is then filtered through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), impacting the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed and then passed through the system with transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the resultant output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) on the original signal without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform modifies the input signal spectrum, and the interaction with \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) further alters this spectrum. Since \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) typically enhances or diminishes certain frequencies, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depends heavily on the transformed version of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) rather than its original form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
