  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\partial_t u = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) applied to the function \\(u(x, 0)\\) at \\(t = 0\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\(u(x, 0)\\) from the state \\(u(x, T)\\) at time \\(T\\) without knowing if a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied, it's impossible to reliably trace back to \\(u(x, 0)\\) since the evolution could represent either a transformed or a non-transformed state, and these states would evolve differently under the operator \\(L\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
