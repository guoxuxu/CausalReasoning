  "Problem": "Consider a multi-dimensional complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex initial vector. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the modified \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the intervention, can we determine precisely whether the original transformation or the intervention dominated without knowing their specific matrix details?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) within the exponential terms and the nature of the Laplace transform make it impossible to discern the dominant influence from the resultant \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone. The matrices' complex values interplay in a manner that masks the individual contributions without detailed knowledge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
