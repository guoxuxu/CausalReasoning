  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We explore the effects of pre-multiplying the input signal by a modulation function \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\\\( m(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the signal is transformed by the Laplace transform without further intervention, will the transformed signal \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at s = s_0 be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was transformed directly without the modulation?",
  "Explanation": "Modulating the signal shifts the Laplace transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( X(s) \\\\) to \\\\( X(s-a) \\\\). This shift results from the Laplace transform's properties under time scaling and exponential modulation, leading to a different transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
