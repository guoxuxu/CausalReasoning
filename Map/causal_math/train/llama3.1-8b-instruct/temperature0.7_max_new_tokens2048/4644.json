  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) described by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We examine the scenario where the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), is applied to explore the integral transformations over the complex function f.\n\nGiven the transformation result from the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{c t}f)(s) \\\\), can we unequivocally backtrack to determine the parameters of f and the value of the intervening shift c only based on this transformed data?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a shifted and manipulated function combines effects in a way that typically obscures discrete insights into both the untouched original function form and the specifics of the shift. Recovery of both original function parameters and intervention specifics uniquely from the Laplace domain result is generally not feasible without additional side information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
