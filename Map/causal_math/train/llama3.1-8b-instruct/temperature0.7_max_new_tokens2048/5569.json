  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\), is used to solve differential equations. We consider the scenario where we apply this transformation to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\) under different initial conditions and interventions.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to solve the differential equation with initial conditions \\\\(y(0) = y_0\\\\) and \\\\(y'(0) = y'_0\\\\), does the solution \\\\(y(t)\\\\) depend strictly on the parameters p and q of the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\(y(t)\\\\) obtained after applying the Laplace transformation and solving the transformed equation inherently depends on the characteristics of the differential equation, namely the constants p and q. The solution in the transformed domain allows us to back-solve to find \\\\(y(t)\\\\), directly reflecting the effects of p and q.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
