  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents an oscillating system in the complex plane. We then apply a Laplace transform to this function, resulting in a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), can we conclusively determine that the initial function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without external information about the frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "From the form \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), while indicative of an exponential function of type \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\), the specific value of \\\\( w \\\\) - the frequency - is necessary to precisely define the original function. Without knowing \\\\( w \\\\), multiple functions corresponding to different frequencies could result in a similar form of Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
