  "Problem": "Explore a system governed by a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z(0) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and consider the effect of a distinct transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex matrix. Analyze the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under various conditions and transformations.\n\nObserving the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if it’s unknown whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The action of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory in a way that might not be distinguishable at time T, particularly when the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) do not commute. The potential application of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) complicates back-tracing to the original state because multiple initial conditions might yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depending on whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied or not.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
