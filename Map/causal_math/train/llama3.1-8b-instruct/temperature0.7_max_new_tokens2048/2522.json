  "Problem": "Assume the function of a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) given by \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\). Evaluate results and transformations within the complex plane, specifically considering the impact of modifications by linear transformations represented by complex constants \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\(w\\\\) from the function \\\\(e^{z}\\\\), can we deduce exactly which \\\\(z\\\\) was used to generate \\\\(w\\\\) without knowing if any linear transformation by a complex constant was applied prior to function application?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of a prior transformation, and given the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane (specifically, the \\\\(2\\\\pi i\\\\) periodicity), multiple different inputs could lead to the same output. This ambiguity is compounded if unknown linear transformations are considered, which could place the initial \\\\(z\\\\) in different forms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
