  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) is initially transformed by applying \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\). We examine how this transformation impacts the integration over a continuous function under different operational conditions.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = 0 and subsequently integrated from x = 0 to 2 without any further intervention, does the resultant integral differ from that obtained by directly integrating \\\\( z(x) \\\\) from x = 0 to 2?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) fundamentally changes the function being integrated. The initial operation transforms the function to \\\\( e^{x^2 + 1} \\\\), leading to an entirely different integral from \\\\( x^2 + 1 \\\\) over the same interval, hence affecting the resultant integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x → z(x); z(x) → h(z); h(z) → e^z; e^z → integral of e^z from 0 to 2; integral of z(x) from 0 to 2 → comparison with e^z integral"
