  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The evolution of this function over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex-valued matrix. Study the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a complex matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is another constant complex matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still depend solely on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intermediate application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) shifts the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) again and makes the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on all three parameters: \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( R \\\\. This introduces additional complexity due to possible non-commutativity and differing effects of the transformations imposed by \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) with \\\\( P \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
