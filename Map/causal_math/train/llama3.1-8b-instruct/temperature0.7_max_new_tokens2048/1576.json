  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different combinations of interventions and transformations. The operations caused by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) might overlap in their effects leading to indistinguishable results, thereby making it impossible to uniquely determine which interventions were applied based solely on the outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
