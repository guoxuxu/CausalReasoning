  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz + u \\\\) with \\\\( u \\\\) being a control function and \\\\( D \\\\) a diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a constant function applied from t = 0 onwards without any further modification, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), at a certain \\\\( s \\\\) reflect only the dynamics governed by \\\\( D \\\\) without the influence of \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The control function \\\\( u \\\\) directly influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as it adds to the homogeneous solution of the differential equation. Consequently, \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depends not only on the eigenstructure of \\\\( D \\\\) but also significantly on \\\\( u \\\\). The integration involves both parts, and it cannot neglect the contribution from \\\\( u \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
