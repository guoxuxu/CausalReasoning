  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) by a linear operator L, defined as \\\\(L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where A is a complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from the result \\\\(L[z(t)]\\\\) without additional information about the transformation parameter A?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the result of \\\\(L[z(t)]\\\\) alone is insufficient to uniquely determine the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) due to the loss of information inherently involved in the integration process and the exponential transformation. Different functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) might yield the same result under L, especially without specific knowledge of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
