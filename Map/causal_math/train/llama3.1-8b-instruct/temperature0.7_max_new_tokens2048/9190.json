  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system's states. The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is used for analysis.\n\nObserving the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a particular value s = s_0, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) affects the shape of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) but given \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) alone without additional boundary or auxiliary conditions, there are typically multiple possible initial conditions that could result in the same transform at \\\\( s_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
