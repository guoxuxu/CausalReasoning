  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function represents a signal in the complex plane, oscillating with time. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform to this function to analyze its spectral properties.\n\nIf the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is computed without intervention, will the resulting function indicate a single frequency component at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) yields a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), reflecting that the original time-domain signal is a pure tone at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Thus, the effect directly displays this frequency component without any interventions altering the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
