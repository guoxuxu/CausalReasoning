  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and it's operated on by the Laplace transform defined by the integration transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). We examine how the operations affect the function over time and how interventions alter its behavior.\n\nCan we deduce the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from the transformed function \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) value at a given \\\\( s \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the frequency \\\\( w \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\). The transform encodes the function into the frequency domain that depends on \\\\( w \\\\) and losing this crucial information impairs causally linking back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
