  "Problem": "We have a LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system characterized by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Lx(t) = y(t) \\\\). In addition, we consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse transformation applied to \\\\( X(s) \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a Laplace transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and then inverse transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) back to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), will the solution \\\\( y(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) at time T be the same if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) had not undergone the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are linear and bijective operations. Applying these transformations to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then reversing them yields the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) exactly, meaning \\\\( y(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) remains unchanged after these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
