  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). An integral transformation using a kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) = e^{-(u^2+v^2)} \\\\) is applied, transforming the function to \\\\( F(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int e^{-(u^2+v^2)}(x^2 + y^2) dx dy \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation is applied to the function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), and then \\\\( F(u, v) \\\\) evolves under its current definition without further transformation, will \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) at a later point differ due to the nature of the initial function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) will have properties influenced directly by the original function \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). The transformation inherently changes the nature and behavior of the function based on the integral of the square of the radius in two-dimensional space, magnifying the impact of changes in x and y.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
