  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 u = f(x, y)\\\\) on a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) with boundary conditions applied. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to analyze the effects and causal relationships of applying different boundary interventions.\n\nIf a specific contouring boundary condition is applied halfway through the time interval, altering the domain boundary shape or type at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final solution \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) depend solely on the change in the source term from \\\\(f_1\\\\) to \\\\(f_2\\\\) and not consider the new boundary adjustment?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention, by altering boundary conditions, significantly affects the outcome. The solution to the Poisson equation depends both on the source term and on the boundary conditions; any alteration in the boundary during the solution process will inherently affect the resultant field at time T, altering the effects from only source term modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
