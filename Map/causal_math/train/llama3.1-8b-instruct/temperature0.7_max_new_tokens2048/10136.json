  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nBased on the observed complex state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it evolved under transformations, can we distinguish whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) or \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both, were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The end-state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various transformations (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) applied at different times or in different sequences. Due to the superposition and the non-unique impact of the matrix exponentials on the trajectories, the specific interventions cannot be definitively isolated just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
