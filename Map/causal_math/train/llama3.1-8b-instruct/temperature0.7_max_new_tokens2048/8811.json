  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system when subjected to different kernel transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) leading to a convolution integral \\\\( (u*h)(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(\\\\tau)h(t-\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) and its impact on the output used in signal processing.\n\nIf we apply an additional operation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) after the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming this result by Laplace, will the final transform equal the product \\\\( U(s)H(s)G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform respects linearity and convolution operations. If \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or the convolution result, the final Laplace transform will incorporate it as a multiplicative factor. Thus, the resulting transform is the product of the Laplace transforms of individual modified inputs, reflecting the effects of sequential transformations (causes) on the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
