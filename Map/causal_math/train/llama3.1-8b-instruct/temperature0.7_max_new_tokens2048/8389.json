  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). Analyzing the impact of the inverse transformation given by \\\\( g(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) where \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( g(t) \\\\) of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to the function output directly, will the resultant time-domain function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) simply be the derivative of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), considering no further transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\), the inverse transformation \\\\( g(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) results in \\\\( g(t) = f'(t) \\\\) under the properties of the Laplace transform. This is a direct outcome without additional intervention, so the effect is just the derivative of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
