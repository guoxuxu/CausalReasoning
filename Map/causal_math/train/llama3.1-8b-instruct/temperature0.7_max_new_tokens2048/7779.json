  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) and its impact on a domain in the complex plane. We analyze how a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), acts on this function.\n\nIf an external function \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied to modify \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) depend only on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and not on \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) as an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f(g(z)) = e^{(z^3)^2} \\\\). This alteration changes the behavior of the function significantly, meaning the resulting \\\\( F(s) \\\\) will be influenced by both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), affecting convergence, domain, and nature of the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
