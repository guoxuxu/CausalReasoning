  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the relationship between applying the Laplace transform on \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and its inverse, and how transformations like matrix exponentiation affect this process.\n\nCan we unambiguously ascertain the presence and type of scaling matrix \\\\( M \\\\) used before the Laplace transform based solely on observing the output from the inverse Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the output helps identify changes in the structure compared to the expected \\\\( e^{Ax} \\\\), multiple scaling matrices could produce similar modifications in the exponentiated results due to overlapping spectrum effects or exponential properties, making it impossible to uniquely determine M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
