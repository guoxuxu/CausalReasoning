  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where x and y are real functions of time t governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), and A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-B)s}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) were applied just by knowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integration and exponential weighting factors across multiple transformations, the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from a variety of different combinations and sequences of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\). The effect of these transformations is not easily separable or reversible, leading to ambiguity in identifying the specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
