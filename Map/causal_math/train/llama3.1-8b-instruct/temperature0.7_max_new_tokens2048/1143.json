  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + K\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(K\\\\) a constant. We analyze the effect of employing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on \\\\(u\\\\), defined by \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), examining how it evolves in the transformed domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying an additional transformation, say a filtering operation represented by a function \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the outcome \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be governed only by the transformed operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not by the nature of the initial condition or the filter function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), a frequency filtering, affects the spectral components of \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, t_1)\\\\) and thus alters the subsequent evolution in the Fourier domain. The final spectrum at time T is influenced by both the intrinsic properties of the linear operator L in the transformed equation and the characteristics of the filter H, along with any initial modifications by the original Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
