  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\), and its transformation through the integral \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the behavior when using two transformations: \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = \\\\sin(t) \\\\).\n\nIf during the process an intervention using \\\\( g(t) = \\\\sin(t) \\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( H(s) \\\\) only depend on the initial function \\\\( h \\\\) and not on the applied transformations \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) = \\\\sin(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the integral transformation. Depending on how \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is altered by \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and at what times these changes occur, the final form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will reflect the cumulative effect of both transformations, thus altering its dependency relative to only \\\\( h \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
