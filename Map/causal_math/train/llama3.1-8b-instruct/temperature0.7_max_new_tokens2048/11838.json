  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane as \\(z(t) = e^{At}z_0\\), where \\(A\\) is a complex constant and \\(z_0\\) is the initial complex value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation given by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\) on the system, where \\(B\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_{t_1}^Te^{Cs}z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\(C\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( I(z) \\) introduces additional dynamics that influence the behavior of the system post-\\( t_1 \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) will be affected by the initial transformation \\( T(z) \\) as well as the subsequent intervention \\( I(z) \\), making it dependent on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
