  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where the current in a circuit is modified through a signal processing function, described by \\\\( I'(t) = L(I(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator characterizing an integral transformation. Here, \\\\( I(t) \\\\) represents the original current signal over time, and we analyze the effects of this transformation over the performance of the circuit.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at time t=0, and then the system's response \\\\( I'(t) \\\\) is analyzed without additional interventions, will the function of the output signal \\\\( I'(T) \\\\) precisely represent the natural evolution of the original current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) under the circuit's original dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The action of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the nature of the current, potentially modifying its frequency components or phase. Without knowing the specifics of \\\\( L \\\\), such a transformation could significantly alter how the current behaves, rather than merely following the natural progression of \\\\( I_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation of current I(t) → Application of L; Application of L → Output signal I'(t); Application of L → Input current I_0; Input current I_0 → Original circuit dynamics; Original circuit dynamics → Natural evolution of current I_0; Natural evolution of current I_0 → Output signal I'(T); Transformation of current I(t) → Output signal I'(t); Output signal I'(t) → Output signal I'(T)"
