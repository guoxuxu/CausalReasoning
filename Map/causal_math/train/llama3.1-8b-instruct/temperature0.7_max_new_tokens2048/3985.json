  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(w) \\) mapping complex numbers where \\( z(w) \\) is defined as \\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega w} \\), with \\( \\omega \\) being a real constant. We explore the implications of an integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) on \\( z(w) \\), defined by \\( Z(v) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w) e^{-ivw} dw \\).\n\nDoes the function \\( Z(v) \\) applied directly to \\( z(w) \\) change the Fourier component of the original function at frequency \\( v \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( Z(v) \\) is essentially the Fourier transform of \\( z(w) \\). It isolates the frequency component \\( e^{i(\\omega-v)w} \\) of the original function, hence directly affecting the component at frequency \\( v \\) and transforming the function's nature in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
