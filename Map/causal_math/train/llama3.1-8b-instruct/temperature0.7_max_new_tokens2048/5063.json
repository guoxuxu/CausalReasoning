  "Problem": "Consider a multivariable control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(x) = D \\\\exp(Mt)x \\\\), with D being another constant matrix, is applied to manipulate the system state over time t.\n\nSuppose an intervention with another function \\\\( j(x) = Q \\\\exp(-Mt)x \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined only by M irrespective of D and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the intervention function \\\\( j(x) \\\\) alters the system's trajectory once again, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) influenced by the matrix operations of D, Q, and especially how they interact with M, due to non-commutativity and varying influences on the system state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
