  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional damping factor is introduced in the temporal domain leading to the modified function \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\gamma t}e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, where \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) is a positive real number, would the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in s-domain till only reflect the changes introduced by \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and ignore \\\\( \\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the modified function, \\\\( \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-\\gamma t}e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt \\\\), results in \\\\( \\frac{1}{s + \\gamma - i\\omega} \\\\), which includes changes introduced by both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\gamma \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) reflects both the frequency and damping modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
