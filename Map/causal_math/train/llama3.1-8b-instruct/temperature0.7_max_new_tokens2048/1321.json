  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC + \\\\frac{1}{R}}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is the capacitance, \\\\(R\\\\) is the resistance, and \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. We investigate the response of the circuit to transformations defined by the Laplace transform of the input voltage signal \\\\(V(s) = L[v(t)]\\\\) where \\\\(v(t) = e^{At}v_0\\\\) being an exponential input signal.\n\nIf \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is applied to the circuit at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the circuit dynamics defined by \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) without further intervention, will the output voltage \\\\(v_{out}(t)\\\\) at t = T mimic the input signal \\\\(v(t)\\\\) for a given T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation induced by the circuit's impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) modifies the output signal. Due to the potency of the capacitive and resistive elements, the output signal \\\\(v_{out}(t)\\\\) will not exactly follow the input signal pattern, reflecting the effects of reactive and resistive damping.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
