  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Y(s) = L\\{y(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform. The system is initially influenced by a forcing function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed version \\\\( H(s) = L\\{h(t)\\} \\\\). We investigate how different operational matrices affect the outcome given by the inverse Laplace transform if applied.\n\nIf the operational matrix \\\\( M(s) \\\\) multiplies \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at the initial state before applying the inverse Laplace, does the cause (original input \\\\( y(t) \\\\)) directly reflect in the effect (transformed output) without any modification by \\\\( M(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operational matrix \\\\( M(s) \\\\) to \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) modifies the original system's output. This manipulation changes the conditions under which the inverse Laplace transform operates, hence the final time-domain function is not just a direct reflection of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) but a modified version dependent on \\\\( M(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
