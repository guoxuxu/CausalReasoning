  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is analyzed over the time domain.\n\nFrom observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the potential ways in which the transformations might have been applied (in various combinations or sequences) create ambiguities. Different overlays of matrix effects due to non-commutativity can result in similar endpoints, making it challenging to decipher the exact transformations used solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
