  "Problem": "Evaluate the causality in a system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze this under the operation of the integral transformation represented by \\(\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt\\), where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial vector \\(z_0\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing \\(z(t)\\) at t = T if it's unknown whether \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\), the resultant \\(z(T)\\) could be due to diverse initial modifications by \\(D\\). The transformation introduces an element of uncertainty in deducing \\(z_0\\) as the influence of \\(D\\) might conceal the effects solely due to \\(C\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
