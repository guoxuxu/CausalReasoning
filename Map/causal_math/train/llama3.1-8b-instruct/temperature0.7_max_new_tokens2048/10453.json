  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without any additional intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially squares the complex number, changing the trajectory path. The transformation modifies the magnitude and the frequency of oscillation of the trajectory, making it distinct from the unmodified path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
