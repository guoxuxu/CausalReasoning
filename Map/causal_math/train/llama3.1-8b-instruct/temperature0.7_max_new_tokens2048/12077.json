  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the differential equations system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z represents a complex variable associated with time t. We analyze the system transformation under the integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i \\\\omega s} ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex state at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain if the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) has been influenced by the integral transformation. The complex integral terms could skew the system's path, obscuring the original condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
