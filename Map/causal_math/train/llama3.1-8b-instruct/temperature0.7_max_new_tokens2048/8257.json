  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time control system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We investigate the role of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, in influencing the state evolution over time.\n\nIf initially at t = 0 the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) is applied to the state vector \\\\(x_0\\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax\\\\) without further control input (\\\\(u=0\\\\)), will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at t = T be solely determined by matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(T(x)\\\\) initially modifies the state according to the integral transformation involving matrix M, which influences the trajectory alongside A due to initial condition adjustment. Thus, the state at time T is affected by both A and M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
