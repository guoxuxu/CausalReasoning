  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an additional functional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, on the eigenvalues of the vector \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Unitary transformations affect vectors in a way that preserves their eigenvalues but can change their directions. Since the outcome at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) retains the same eigenvalues irrespective of the transformations \\\\( U \\\\) or \\\\( V \\\\), it's impossible to ascertain from just \\\\( x(T) \\\\) which specific transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
