  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform on a function representing vector components \\\\( v(t) \\), where \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then left to evolve as per \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the frequency components of \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > 0 be the same as the initial frequency components of \\\\( v_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the Fourier transform alters the representation of \\\\( v_0 \\\\) by decomposing it into its frequency components. The subsequent evolution according to \\\\( e^{At}v_0 \\\\) then modifies these components differently depending on A, which results in a different spectrum at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
