  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator L, which transforms functions based on the equation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} k(s) x(t-s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function. An intervention is applied by modifying the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to a new function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a certain point after the initial condition.\n\nIf a new input function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) replaces \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the output at t = T for T > t_1 depend only on the initial input function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the input function within the system, causing a consequent change in the system's response. Thus, the output at t = T will indeed depend on both the initial input function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and the intervention function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), reflecting the cumulative effects of both inputs under the transformation by L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(t) → x(t); x(t) → L[x(t)]; L[x(t)] → L[h(t)]; x(t_1) → h(t); L[h(t)] → output at T"
