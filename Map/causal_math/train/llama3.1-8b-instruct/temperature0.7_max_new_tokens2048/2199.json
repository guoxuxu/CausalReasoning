  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by its impulse response h(t) is being studied. The signal s(t) is processed, and we analyze the influence of convolution with the impulse response and a Fourier transform applied to the signal.\n\nIf a filtering process described by another impulse response g(t) is applied as an intervention after the initial convolution but before the Fourier transform, will the Fourier transform of the final output depend exclusively on the original h(t) or both h(t) and g(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter g(t) leads to an additional convolution process, making the Fourier transform of the eventual outcome dependent on both h(t) and g(t). The final transformation represents the product of the Fourier transforms of s(t), h(t), and g(t), influenced by the sequential convolutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s(t) → s(t) * h(t); s(t) * h(t) → Fourier Transform; s(t) * h(t) → Filtering by g(t); Filtering by g(t) → Fourier Transform; Fourier Transform → Final Output"
