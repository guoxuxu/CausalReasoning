  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and analyze its effects over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0)) \\\\) is used as the initial condition and the system is allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if the original \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was used directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition changes the spatial frequency components of the temperature distribution. Since the heat equation solves differently based on these initial conditions, the final distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) will not be the same as starting with \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
