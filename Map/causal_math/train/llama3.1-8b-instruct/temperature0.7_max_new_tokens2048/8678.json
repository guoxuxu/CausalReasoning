  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transformation. Analyzing the behavior between the Laplacian and Fourier transformations of the function as it manifests in the complex domain.\n\nGiven the result of the Fourier transform, can we uniquely determine the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "There are fundamental differences in how the Fourier and Laplace transforms treat function behavior, especially regarding convergence at infinity and complex frequency handling. One cannot infer the original Laplacian behavior solely from the Fourier result without adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
