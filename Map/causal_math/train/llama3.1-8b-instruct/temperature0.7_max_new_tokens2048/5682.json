  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial function \\( u(0, x) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the initial Fourier transform, the back transformation might yield erroneous results, particularly considering phase shifts and the possibility of loss of information in frequency space, depending on \\( \\xi \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
