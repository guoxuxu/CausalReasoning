  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents the angular frequency. We analyze the manipulation of system dynamics by introducing a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\)\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to its definition without any transformation applied, will the behavior of the system in the frequency domain be captured identically by applying the Laplace transform at any point in time?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without intervention will naturally follow its exponential oscillation. However, evaluating it with the Laplace transform, which analyzes the system from a frequency-domain perspective, alters the representation and insights about the system, notably focusing on decay rates and stability rather than purely oscillatory behavior.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → z(t) evolving over time; s → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → L(z)(s); L(z)(s) → behavior in the frequency domain"
