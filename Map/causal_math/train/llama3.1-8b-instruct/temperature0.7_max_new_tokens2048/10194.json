  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}B u(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and u(t) is a control input. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform on the control signal u(t), denoted as \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\\\), and its impact on the transformed system output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).\n\nFrom the transformed output \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely deduce the original control input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without any additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) generally requires inverse transforming and knowledge of the entire system dynamics including matrices A and B. Without explicit values or certain properties of these matrices, it can be ambiguous or impossible due to potential multiple functions mapping to the same Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
