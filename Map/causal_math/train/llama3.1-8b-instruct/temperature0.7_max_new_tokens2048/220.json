  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( u(z) \\\\) represents a potential field. We're exploring the effect of a linear transformation on this field, specifically through the function \\\\( T(w) = (Aw + b) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( w \\\\) is the transformed variable.\n\nCan the set of transformations used (either \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) be determined uniquely by observing the final value of \\\\( u(w) \\\\) after all transformations at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of complex transformations, especially with the involvement of linear changes encapsulated by A, b, C, and d, the final state could be achieved via various sequences of transformations. The overlap in potential transformation effects given the final evaluation of the potential field creates ambiguities in reverse engineering the exact transformations used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The linear transformation T and its parameters A and b can be uniquely determined by observing the final value of u(w) after all transformations, given the influence of S on w, which in turn affects u(w)."
