  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) =  x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a signal's components in time. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf we observe a modified time-domain function after applying an inverse Fourier transform, can we definitively trace back and identify the specific filtering process used (i.e., determine \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\)) without prior knowledge about the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the exact nature of the filtering process or additional data, it is generally impossible to uniquely determine which filter (\\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\)) was applied in the frequency domain purely based on the modified time-domain output. Similar filters could produce indistinguishably comparable effects in certain setups.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
