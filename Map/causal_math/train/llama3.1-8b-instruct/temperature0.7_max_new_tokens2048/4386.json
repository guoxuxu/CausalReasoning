  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), and A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\), on this system.\n\nAfter observing the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at s = 0, can we accurately deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the Laplace transform, transformations from the time domain to the complex frequency domain involve integral operations that potentially obscure details about the original state due to changes in the information structure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
