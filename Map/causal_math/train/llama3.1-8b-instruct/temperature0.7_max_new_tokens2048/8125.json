  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(u) = u + c\\\\) where c is a constant offset applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) such that \\\\( u'(x,0) = u(x,0) + c \\\\), and the system is thereafter allowed to evolve under the original heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was evolved to time T without applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by increasing every point of the temperature distribution uniformly by c. While the distribution's evolution still obeys the same heat equation, the entire resulting curve \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\) will be offset by c compared to the curve that would result from evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
