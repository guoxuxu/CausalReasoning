  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) in a two-dimensional space. We inquire about the impacts via transformations represented by \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) and subsequent linear transformations \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z \\\\) obtained from transformed coordinates \\\\( (e^{x_0}, e^{y_0}) \\\\), can we determine the original coordinates \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) just by knowing the resultant \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the exponential transformation \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) modifies the coordinates non-linearly, we cannot uniquely infer the original coordinates from the computed \\\\( z \\\\) alone without additional data about the transformations applied.",
