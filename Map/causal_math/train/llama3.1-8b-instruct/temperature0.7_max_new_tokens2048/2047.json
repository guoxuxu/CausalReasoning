  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a perturbative Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) described by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iH't} \\\\) acts on the system, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by \\\\( H' \\\\) at time T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by a perturbative Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) introduces a new transformation factor, modifying the system's trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. This changes the resultant state due to the new exponential operator acting on the state, manifesting in a changed evolution that differs from the original unperturbed path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
