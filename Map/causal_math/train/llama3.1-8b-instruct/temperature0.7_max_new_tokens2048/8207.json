  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) defined on a complex domain, and a transformation h(z) where \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\). We analyze the effect of applying this transformation to various complex numbers and observing the results over the domain.\n\nIf at a certain point, another transformation g(z) = e^z is applied as an intervention to the output of h(z), will the final output of f(z) for this transformed value depend solely on the initial function h(z)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with g(z) adds another layer of transformation which significantly affects the original mapping provided by h(z). The outcome of f(z) now depends on both the exponential transformation and the squaring, making the system's behavior more complex and not solely dependent on h(z).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(z) → h(z); h(z) → g(z); g(z) → output of f(z); z → h(z); z → g(z); z → output of f(z)"
