  "Problem": "Consider a domain in the complex plane where we evaluate the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dt \\\\), with C being a contour in the complex plane. We explore the effect of varying the parameter z and modifying the contour C.\n\nIf a specific analytical continuation is applied to redefine the contour C into C' at a midway point in the evaluation process, will the resulting transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) solely reflect changes governed by the new contour C' and not by the original C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an analytical continuation redefining the contour affects the integral from the point of intervention onward. However, properties of the original contour C prior to the continuation still influence part of the calculation, particularly if the contour modification was not holistic from the start of the integration process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
