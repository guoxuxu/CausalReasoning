  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in a two-dimensional plane over time t. The transformation defined by the integral \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where s is a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will this transformed state at t = T differ from the state if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly integrated to t = T without the exponential factor?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation introduces a complex exponential modifier \\\\( e^{st} \\\\), which scales and rotates the contributions of \\\\( z(\\\\tau) \\\\) differently compared to mere integration. This results in different amplitudes and phase shifts, altering the trajectory and final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
