  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if no transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its inception, accumulating effects from both the complex function and the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). This changes both the magnitude and the direction of the original functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), resulting in a different endpoint at time T.",
