  "Problem": "A function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined in the complex plane and its evolution is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, and analyze its effects on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initially at t = 0 modifies the starting condition to \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\). Since the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from this altered start will not match the evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unmodified, due to the exponential factor introduced by D, affecting amplitude and phase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
