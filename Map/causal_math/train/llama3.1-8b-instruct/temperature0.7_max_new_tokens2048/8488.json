  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function f(t), given by F(s) = \\\\(\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\). The behavior of the system is also influenced by a Fourier transform transformation, defined by G(ω) = \\\\(\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iωt}f(t) dt\\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting function after Fourier transformation G(ω), can we determine precisely what interventions or transformations (initial Laplace transform, filtering operation) were applied, solely based on the knowledge of G(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions may result in similar or identical Fourier transform outcomes due to the overlapping effects of time-scaling, frequency shifting, and other transformation properties. Consequently, it is impractical to uniquely ascertain the sequence or types of interventions exclusively from G(ω).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
