  "Problem": "Imagine a mechanical system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + p\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + qx = 0\\\\), where p and q are constants. An external force described by a function \\\\(f(t) = A\\\\sin(ωt)\\\\) is potentially applied to the system, affecting its behavior.\n\nIf the displacement \\\\(x(T)\\\\) of the system is known at some time T, can we uniquely determine the initial velocity \\\\(v_0\\\\) without knowing whether the external force \\\\(f(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the external force application, the observed displacement \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of initial conditions and force parameters. The equation is influenced by the force's amplitude and frequency, contributing to different possible initial velocities leading to the same displacement.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
