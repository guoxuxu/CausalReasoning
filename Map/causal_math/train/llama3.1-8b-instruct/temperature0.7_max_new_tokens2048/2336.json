  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where heat conduction through a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature at position \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the temperature at a particular point according to the function \\\\(h(x, t) = e^{−at}sin(bx)\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to determine specifically which functions \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(j(x, t)\\\\) were applied, knowing only the final temperature database \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The fact that multiple configurations of \\\\(a, b, c,\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\), when applied through \\\\(h\\\\) and \\\\(j\\\\), could lead to similar temperature distributions by time \\\\(T\\\\) due to the diffusive nature of the heat equation. This similarity makes it impractical to backtrack uniquely to the specific parameters or functions applied, as different combinations can yield similarly evolved end states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
