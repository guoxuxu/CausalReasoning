  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Stokes' theorem in a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\) over a manifold. The theorem states \\\\( \\\\int_{\\\\partial M} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{r} = \\\\int_M (\\\\nabla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}) \\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\). We explore how applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathbf{F}(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\mathbf{F}(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) affects the relationship outlined by Stokes' theorem.\n\nIf an intervention applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\mathbf{F}(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} \\\\mathbf{F}(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied at some time after applying Laplace transform, will the new boundary and surface integrals in Stokes' theorem depend only on the original vector field and not on the transforms?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening with a Fourier transform imposes another layer of transformation on top of the already Laplace-transformed field, which alters how the field is represented and interacts over the manifold. This additional transformation modifies how the integrals are computed and interpreted, and the resultant boundary and surface integrals in Stokes' theorem will depend on the nature of both transformations and not just the original field.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
