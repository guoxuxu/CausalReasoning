  "Problem": "Consider a system dynamics where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle in a one-dimensional space is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = -kx(t) + F(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) a positive constant representing damping and \\\\( F(t) \\\\) an external force function. The study involves the introduction of a sudden force impulse \\\\( F(t) = I \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\), where \\\\( I \\\\) is the impulse magnitude and \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nDoes the introduction of the impulse at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) fundamentally alter the system's state at any time \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) compared to if no impulse were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The impulse introduces an instantaneous change in the velocity of the particle, effectively changing its trajectory from that point onward. The evolution of the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_0 \\\\) will reflect this instantaneous shift, diverging from the trajectory had the impulse not been applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
