  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) \\\\) is applied at the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition does not affect the time-dependent solutions of the heat equation. The evolution of the heat distribution will converge back from the Fourier transform spectrum to the spatial temperature distribution under normal heat flow, leading to the same state at any later time t = T as if it evolved directly.",
