  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number representing an initial value in the complex plane. This scenario deals with the evolution of the complex function over time and explores the possible effects of external complex transformations.\n\nCan we precisely calculate the original value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the exact value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends explicitly on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) through the exponential term \\\\( e^{i \\omega T} \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( \\omega \\\\), the calculation of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined because multiple values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) could result in the same observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
