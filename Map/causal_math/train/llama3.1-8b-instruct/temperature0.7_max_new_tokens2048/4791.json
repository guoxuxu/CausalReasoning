  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop control system where the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is passed through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is regulated to meet certain performance specifications. We investigate the implications of introducing a disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) modeled by \\\\( D(s) = \\\\frac{5}{s+2} \\\\) on the output.\n\nIf a compensatory feedback control \\\\( k(t) = K(s)u(t) \\\\) where \\\\( K(s) = -\\\\frac{5}{s+2} \\\\) is added to neutralize the disturbance effect at —a certain time, will the system's output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) reflect only the influence of the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), independent of the disturbance?",
  "Explanation": "The specifically designed compensatory feedback control \\\\( K(s) \\\\) effectively cancels out the influence of the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) modeled by \\\\( D(s) \\\\). This intervention allows the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to solely reflect the characteristics of the input signal as governed by the system transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), thus neutralizing the effect of the disturbance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
