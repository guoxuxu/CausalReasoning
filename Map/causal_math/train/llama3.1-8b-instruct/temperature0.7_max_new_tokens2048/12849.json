  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a system exhibiting harmonic motion in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-s\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nCan we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by just observing the result of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at any time T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alone is not possible because the integral transformation effectively 'blurs' different portions of the trajectory, depending on the decay factor and the system's oscillatory nature, making it difficult to recover \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
