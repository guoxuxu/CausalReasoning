  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the precise original frequency \\\\( ω \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by analyzing the output \\\\( F(ω) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The output of the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) is a delta function centered at \\\\( ω \\\\). This narrow, singular response directly indicates the original frequency, thus enabling precise determination of \\\\( ω \\\\) from \\\\( F(ω) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
