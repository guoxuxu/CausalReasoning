  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) after observing the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the exact transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform can obscure some information about the phase of the original signal unless it's specifically tailored to preserve it. Without knowing how the transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) was applied, \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
