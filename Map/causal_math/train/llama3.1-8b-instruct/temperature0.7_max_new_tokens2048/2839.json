  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nIf at a certain point someone modifies the original function by an additional transformation \\\\( G(x) = x(t) + \\\\alpha sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants, will the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for an arbitrary \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) still reflect only the original function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through \\\\( G(x) \\\\) adds a new component to the function, which will also be reflected in the Fourier transform spectrum. The resulting \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) will contain additional frequencies and amplitudes corresponding to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
