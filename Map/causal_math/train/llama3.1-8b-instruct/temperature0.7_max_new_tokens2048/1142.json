  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + K\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator and \\\\(K\\\\) a constant. We analyze the effect of employing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on \\\\(u\\\\), defined by \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), examining how it evolves in the transformed domain.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) in the Fourier domain at time T, can we accurately recover the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) knowing only the transformed equation but not whether the Fourier transform was originally applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\) requires inverse Fourier transforming and precisely knowing the initial conditions and whether the transform was initially applied. Without definitively knowing if the initial state was transformed, ambiguities in possible added components or transformations impede exact recovery.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → transformed equation; linear differential operator → differential equation; constant K → transformed equation; time T → state in Fourier domain; state in Fourier domain → original function u(x, 0); original function u(x, 0) → differential equation; differential equation → state in Fourier domain"
