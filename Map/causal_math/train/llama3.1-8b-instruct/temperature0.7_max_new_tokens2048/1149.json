  "Problem": "Assume a function defined on complex numbers \\\\(z\\\\) as \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. This function undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a}\\\\) for \\\\(\\\\operatorname{Re}(s) > \\\\operatorname{Re}(a)\\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation on various scenarios.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\(f(z) = e^{az}\\\\) is transformed using Laplace and then inverted back to the time domain without any modifications, is the retrieved function identical to the original function \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inversion theorem ensure that, given proper conditions such as linearity and integral convergence, transforming a function into the frequency domain and subsequently inverting it back will perfectly retrieve the original function, assuming no external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
