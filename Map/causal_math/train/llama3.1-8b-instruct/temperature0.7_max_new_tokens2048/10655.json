  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We are evaluating whether the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) applied to this function affects its causal inference properties.\n\nIf an intervention changes \\\\( a \\\\) to a new constant \\\\( b \\\\) at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform only depend on the new value \\\\( b \\\\) and ignore the prior effects of \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform will reflect both the initial influence of \\\\( a \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the subsequent effect of \\\\( b \\\\). Due to the memory property encapsulated in the integration process, both segments contribute to the final result, affecting convergence and pole characteristics in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
