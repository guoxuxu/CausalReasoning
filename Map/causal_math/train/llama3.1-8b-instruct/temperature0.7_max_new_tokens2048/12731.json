  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(\\ z = h(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\)\\), where x and y are variables modified by a transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\) dependent on parameters A and B.\n\nGiven \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\(\\ T \\)\\), \\(\\ Q \\)\\), or both), solely from knowing \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly what transformations were applied from the endpoint \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) is not feasible due to the non-linearity and potential for different combinations of transformations \\(\\ T \\)\\) and \\(\\ Q \\)\\) to yield similar outputs. Multiple transformation paths can lead to the same \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) value, especially considering complex exponential and polynomial effects in transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
