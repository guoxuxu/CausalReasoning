  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is then transformed using a Fourier Transform to analyze its frequency components over time.\n\nCan we precisely recover the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in a delta function at \\\\( \\omega \\\\), which precisely pinpoints the original frequency. Thus, the recovery of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the transform is exact, allowing an accurate deduction of the cause from the observed effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
