  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled by a differential equation involving complex functions and integral transformations, specifically \\\\(I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)A}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where I is the current, V is the voltage, A is a constant matrix, and t is time.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original voltage function \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at t = 0, merely by observing \\\\(I(T)\\\\) at time T, without knowing about any applied transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) alone lacks sufficient detail to trace back to the exact voltage due to potential unknown transformative effects on \\\\(V(t)\\\\). Without clarity on whether or how the function was altered beforehand, multiple voltage profiles could converge to the same observed current.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
