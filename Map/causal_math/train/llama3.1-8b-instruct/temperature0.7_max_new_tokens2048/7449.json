  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nIf the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is set to a fixed function and allowed to proceed without any intervention, will the output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) solely depend on the behavior of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation strictly depends on the history of \\\\( I(t) \\\\) from 0 to T through the convolution integral, the output \\\\( V(T) \\\\) at time T is determined entirely by the input current function within that interval, without influence from external factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
