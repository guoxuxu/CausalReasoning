  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented in matrix form \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. The system is transformed by performing a Laplace transform which alters the system to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform, and s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf the original system \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) is used to compute a solution x, and subsequently, the Laplace transform is applied to this solution, does the resulting transformed solution \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(x)(s)\\\\) satisfy the transformed equation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming there are no singularities affecting the convergence, and if the Laplace transforms \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(A)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(x)\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(b)\\\\) are all well-defined, the transformed system should still hold as the operation of the Laplace transform is linear and obeys the superposition and homogeneity principles applicable to linear systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace transform to the system Ax = b → Transforming the system to ℒ(A) * X(s) = ℒ(b)(s); Applying Laplace transform to the solution x → Obtaining ℒ(x)(s); Solution x → Laplace transform is applied to this solution"
