  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its effect through an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter. We examine the behaviors of different functions and the impact of alterations to the integral transform.\n\nGiven the result of the integral transformation, can we determine precisely the nature of any interventions (such as application of \\\\(m(z)\\\\)), only by observing the value of \\\\(T[mf](s)\\\\) at s = a?",
  "Explanation": "The specific outcome of \\\\(T[mf](s)\\\\) could result from different functions and transformations. Without additional context or constraints on possible functions or transformations, multiple different interventions could produce the same transformed output, making it impossible to uniquely identify the specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
