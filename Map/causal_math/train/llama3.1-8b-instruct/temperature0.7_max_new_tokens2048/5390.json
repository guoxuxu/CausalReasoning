  "Problem": "Consider a linear system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the implications of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the system, affecting the solution characteristics over time t.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied, it's challenging to reverse engineer the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) because the transform could have altered the frequency spectrum, impacting how L acts on the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
