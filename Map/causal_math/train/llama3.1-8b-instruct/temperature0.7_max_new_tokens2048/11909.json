  "Problem": "Consider a controlled linear dynamical system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix defining the system dynamics, C is the control matrix, and u is a control input function. To analyze the impact, we introduce an external transformation function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mx} \\\\), where M is also a constant matrix that modifies the state x.\n\nGiven the trajectory \\\\( x(t) \\\\) up to t = T, can we reliably determine whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 based solely on this trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory \\\\( x(t) \\\\) itself may be highly dependent on the simultaneous influences of D, C, and u. Without explicit knowledge of the form and effect of M, and without additional information about initial states or control variations, it's not possible to uniquely attribute changes in trajectory to the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
