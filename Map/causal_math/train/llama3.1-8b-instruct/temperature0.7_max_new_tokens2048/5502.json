  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. Let's define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t=0 without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any attempt to deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be indeterminate since the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\) ambiguously scales and rotates the original values of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) in a way that cannot be uniquely reversed without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
