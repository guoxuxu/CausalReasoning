  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H \\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. We examine the effect of a unitary transformation \\\\(U(t) = e^{-i At}\\\\) on the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a Hermitian operator.\n\nCan we determine the initial state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately trace back the original state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) as the transformation could have altered the state in a pivotal way that is not deducible from the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) alone, especially if \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(H\\\\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
