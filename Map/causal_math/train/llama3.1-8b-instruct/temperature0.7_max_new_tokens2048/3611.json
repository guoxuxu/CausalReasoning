  "Problem": "The behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. An operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling factor.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and independent of whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention, introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), overlays additional transformations to the existing solution path, further complicating the dependence on the original state and the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The two complex exponential factors, \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\), modify the trajectory in a way that is sensitive to the initial conditions and other operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
