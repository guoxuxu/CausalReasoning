  "Problem": "We examine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a second-order differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) represents an external driving force. We explore the impacts of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( k(z) = e^{-i\\\\delta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the initial parameters \\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\gamma, \\\\beta\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces additional complex exponential transformations which further modify the system's dynamics. The final state at T, hence, becomes dependent not just on the initial parameters but also significantly on the transformations' parameters \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), affecting both the amplitude and the oscillation phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
