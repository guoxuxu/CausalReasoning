  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations or a single transformation with different parameters. The nature of integral transformations and their effects on phase and amplitude makes it challenging to unequivocally determine the specific interventions or their parameters solely based on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
