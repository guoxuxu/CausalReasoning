  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the response \\( V(t) \\) over time t is governed by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}V = 0 \\), with L representing inductance, R resistance, and C capacitance. We explore the behavior following a Laplace transform of the voltage signal \\( V(t) \\), represented as \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\).\n\nIf the initial conditions (voltage and derivative of voltage at t=0) are set for the circuit and allowed to evolve according to the given differential equation without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) of the resulting \\( V(t) \\) be solely determined by the parameters L, R, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) is fully determined by the differential equation and its initial conditions. The parameters L, R, and C dictate the system’s characteristic polynomial in the Laplace domain, which uniquely defines \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) based on the given initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
