  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping described by \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\) in the complex plane, and assess the impact of an integral transformation on this function given as \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int e^{-st} w(t) \\\\, dt \\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\) defines an initial state of the system and evolves through time without any external integral transformations, does the output state at time \\\\(T\\\\) solely depend on the original mapping \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no transformation alters the function, the system's state at any time \\\\(T\\\\) will only reflect the inherent changes dictated by the structure of the function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), which describes its complete time evolution when unmodified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
