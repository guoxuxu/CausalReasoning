  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. The impact of the Laplace transform on this function is analyzed over a variable \\\\(s\\\\) in the complex domain.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Bz}\\\\) is introduced as an intervention, modifying the initial function by \\\\(h(z) = f(z)g(z)\\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\(H(s)\\\\) still reflect properties of A only?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the initial function to \\\\(h(z) = e^{(A+B)z}\\\\), and the Laplace transform changes to \\\\(H(s) = (sI - (A+B))^{-1}\\\\). Thus, the output \\\\(H(s)\\\\) depends on both A and B, reflecting properties of the intervening transformation as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
