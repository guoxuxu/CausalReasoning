  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z a complex variable. We examine the effect of an integral tranformation \\\\( h(g) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) dt \\\\), with B as another constant matrix, over an interval [0, T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( z_1 \\\\) within [0, T], a new operator \\\\( j(g) = e^{Cz}g(z) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the function after the interval T reflect only the initial setup (A and B) and not the intervening variable C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the operator \\\\( j(g) \\\\) partway through the interval modifies the mapping of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), adding dependencies on the matrix C as well as A and B. The outcome at T, even under the same initial and boundary conditions, will differ due to this multilayered integration of influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
