  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the effect of two linear transformations \\\\( T_1(z) = az \\\\) and \\\\( T_2(z) = bz \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are non-zero complex constants, on the mapping described by \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T_1(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f \\\\) is applied, does the resulting value \\\\( f(T_1(z_0)) \\\\) equal \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) fundamentally changes when \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is scaled by \\\\( a \\\\). Specifically, \\\\( f(T_1(z_0)) = (az_0)^n = a^n z_0^n \\\\), and this is not necessarily equal to \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) unless \\\\( a^n = 1 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T_1 \\\\) alters the output of \\\\( f \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
