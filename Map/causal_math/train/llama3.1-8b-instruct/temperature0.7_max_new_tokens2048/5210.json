  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Analyze the changes induced by performing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function, leading to the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nCan the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform creates a peak (Dirac delta function) at the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), which can be uniquely identified in the spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\). This allows for precise determination of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) from the effect back to the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
