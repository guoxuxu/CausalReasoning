  "Problem": "Consider a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) that is governed by the Schrodinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). An integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = \\\\int h(x) \\\\psi(x,t) dx \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a fixed function.\n\nIf between t = 0 and t = T an additional transformation \\\\( g(\\\\psi) = \\\\int k(x) \\\\psi(x,t) dx \\\\) (where \\\\( k(x) \\\\) is another fixed function) is applied at some intermediate time t = t_1, will the value of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at t = T be solely dependent on the initial \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) and unaffected by the transformation \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\) at time t_1 injects a new dynamic into the evolution of \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\), potentially altering the wave function in a manner that influences the subsequential computation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at t = T. This dependency reflects the cumulative impact of the evolving potential and the applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
