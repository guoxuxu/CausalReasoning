  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, y) u(y, t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from the knowledge of \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) without knowing the kernel function \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the kernel function \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\), it is not possible to reverse the integral transformation accurately. The function \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) depends heavily on the kernel, and without this information, the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
