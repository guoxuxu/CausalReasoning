  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) being constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) representing control input. We investigate the effect when applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to the state vector.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) when it evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\) without any additional control input changes, will the transformation \\\\(X(s)\\\\) at any frequency \\\\(s\\\\) completely characterize the state over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\(X(s)\\\\) provides the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\), but it does not fully characterize the time-domain behavior of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) without additional information about initial conditions or time-varying inputs. The nature of \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) and their impact on system state cannot be fully isolated just by frequency analysis.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
