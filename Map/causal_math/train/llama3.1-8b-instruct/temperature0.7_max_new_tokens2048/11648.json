  "Problem": "In a theoretical study, consider the mapping of complex variables using the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex number. This function represents a rotation in the complex plane. We inspect the effects of spatial transformations by separate function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nGiven the final observed position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) on the complex plane, is it possible to uniquely determine whether the intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) or only \\\\( e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Identical final states \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) or solely \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\), when the interval and magnitude of their application result in the same net rotation. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify which operations (intervention or no intervention) led to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
