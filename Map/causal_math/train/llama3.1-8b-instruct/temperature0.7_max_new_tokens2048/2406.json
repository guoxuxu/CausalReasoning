  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effects of introducing function transformations and boundary perturbations on the solution \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nHaving observed the function \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) = v(x) \\\\) without knowing the eigenvalues associated with the operational domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the eigenvalues, deducing the exact initial condition \\\\( v(x) \\\\) from the observed \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is undetermined due to the potential overlap and sum of various eigenfunctions' effects, expanding in different eigenmodes over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
