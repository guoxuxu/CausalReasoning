  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T: f(x) \\\\mapsto \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The causal relationship of this transformation in signal processing contexts (Laplace Transform) is studied.\n\nGiven the result of a convolution of two functions in the frequency domain, can we decipher precisely which function was originally \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and which was \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplication in the s-domain due to convolution does not retain distinct identities of the original functions, leading to an ambiguity in distinguishing between the transformed counterparts of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). Multiple function pairs could potentially yield the same product result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Convolution of f(t) and g(t) → Result in Frequency Domain; s → f(t); s → g(t); f(t) → Convolution of f(t) and g(t); g(t) → Convolution of f(t) and g(t)"
