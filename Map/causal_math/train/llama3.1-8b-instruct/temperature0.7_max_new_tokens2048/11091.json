  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where c is a speed constant. Study the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t,x)) \\\\) on the spatial variable.\n\nIf during the evolution of the system, a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\) solely reflect changes dictated by the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor modifies the amplitude of each frequency component, affecting their evolution irrespective of the original wave equation. This external influence alters how the components decay over time, thereby changing the state at any subsequent time from what would be predicted by the original PDE alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
