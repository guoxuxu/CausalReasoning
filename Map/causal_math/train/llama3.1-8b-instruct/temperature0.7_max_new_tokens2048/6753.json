  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is examined over time.\n\nIf an initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) evolves normally under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), and later applies the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), will the function \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( T[z] \\\\) were applied continuously during evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation only at the end of the evolution will result in a single value computed from the entire trajectory, which differs fundamentally from continuously applying the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\), affecting its accumulation differently over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
