  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) defined by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( dW(t) \\\\) represents the differential of a Wiener process (Brownian motion). We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = T equal the evolution of \\\\( X_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\( dX = AX dt + B dW(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(X) = X e^{Ct} \\\\) alters the initial state, which in turn affects the trajectory under the stochastic process. The introduction of \\\\( C \\\\) adds a new exponential factor which influences the volatility and mean of the process, resulting in a distinct trajectory at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
