  "Problem": "Consider the flow behavior of a fluid characterized by the complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), where \\\\( w(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\) represents a complex potential in the z-plane. Analyze the effect of a conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is a complex function and evaluate its implications on the fluid flow.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint flow pattern at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we specifically determine which transformations (whether \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\), \\\\( z = e^{g(w)} \\\\), or both) were used, purely based on the knowledge of the fluid pattern at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformations applied to the fluid system purely based on the endpoint fluid pattern at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is challenging. The impacts of \\\\( e^{f(w)} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{g(w)} \\\\) on the fluid dynamics can overlap, creating ambiguity in the causal inference of the flow pattern changes. Different combinations or sequences of transformations could potentially yield similar changes in the flow pattern at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
