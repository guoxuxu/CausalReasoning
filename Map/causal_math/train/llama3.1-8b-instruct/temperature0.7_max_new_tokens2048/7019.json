  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which maps a function in the time domain to a function in the complex frequency domain. Investigate the effect of modifying this transformation by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where a is a real number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the system further at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying a second Laplace operational factor \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), does this mean the resulting function only depends on the most recent intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant function at any point reflects the effects of all transformations applied. Even with the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the resulting function is affected by both \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\), reflecting a cumulative impact leading to a function \\\\( f(t-a-b) \\\\) in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → e^(-as); e^(-as) → L[f(t)]; intervention at t_1 → e^(-bs); e^(-bs) → L[f(t)]; t_1 → intervention at t_1; L[f(t)] → f(t)"
