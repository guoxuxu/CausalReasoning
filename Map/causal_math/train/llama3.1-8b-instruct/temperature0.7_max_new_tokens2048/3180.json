  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system defined by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a matrix representing system dynamics. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\( L \\{x(t)\\} \\), and then modifying this transform with a filter defined by the function \\( H(s) \\), where s is the complex frequency variable.\n\nKnowing the final state \\( x(T) \\) and the initial condition \\( x_0 \\), is it possible to determine exactly which filters (whether \\( H(s) \\), \\( J(s) \\), or both) were applied during the interval from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( x(T) \\) resulting from linear transformations and filtering can be derived from different combinations of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( J(s) \\). The non-uniqueness of the filters' spectral effects means multiple filter configurations could yield the same \\( x(T) \\), making it impossible to pinpoint the exact filters used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
