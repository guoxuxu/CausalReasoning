  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant frequency. To analyze this, a transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\phi(z) =  \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t)z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is also a real constant, is applied at various times.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( \\\\phi(z) \\\\), \\\\( \\\\psi(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from a variety of phase manipulations due to the additive effects of the transformations \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\exp(-i\\\\theta t) \\\\). Different sequences or amounts of phase shifts could yield the same final state, making it challenging to determine the specific interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
