  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable z, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The question examines the sensitivity of the integral transformation under varying parameters.\n\nIf we actively modify z through a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) at some point during the evaluation process, will the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) still depend only on s?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies z, which affects the entire integral as z appears in the exponent in the integrand. Now, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depends on both the parameter s and the new form of z, \\\\( z^k \\\\), indicating dependence on the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
