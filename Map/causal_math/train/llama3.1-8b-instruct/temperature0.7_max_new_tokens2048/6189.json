  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t match that obtained from evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system by adding a sinusoidal component. Given the linearity of the heat equation, this additional term evolves independently under the heat equation, resulting in a different temperature distribution at any later time due to the influence of the term \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) propagating and diffusing over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
