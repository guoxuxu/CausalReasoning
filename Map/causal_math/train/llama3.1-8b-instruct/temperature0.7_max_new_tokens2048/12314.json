  "Problem": "Consider the impact of varying the counterpart of a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant real number, on the integral transform \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\\\). We investigate how changes in \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) affect the outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nIf during observation a linear phase shift \\\\\\( \\\\phi(t) = \\\\alpha t \\\\\\) where \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\) is a constant, is applied at time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), will the analysis of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) for \\\\\\( t > t_1 \\\\\\) only depend on the original \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) value without considering \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\\\) introduces additional phase variation, affecting the Fourier transform output. Both \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\\\)'s values determine the new \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\)'s characteristics post-\\\\\\(_t1\\\\\\), as they influence the resultant frequency and phase attributes of the complex exponentials in the Fourier domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
