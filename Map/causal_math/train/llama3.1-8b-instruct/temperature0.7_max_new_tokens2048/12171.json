  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nIf the integral of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) results in a non-zero value, can we conclusively deduce the presence of a mid-interval phase shift intervention?",
  "Explanation": "A non-zero result from \\\\( F(z) \\\\) may suggest an alteration such as a phase shift, but it could also be a result of other types of interventions, like changes in frequency or amplitude, or even no intervention at all if the integral of the original function over its period does not complete full cycles. Thus, multiple scenarios could lead to a non-zero integral, and a specific intervention isn’t identifiable uniquely without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
