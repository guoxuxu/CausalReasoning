  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation on the state vector described by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nHaving observed \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the initial computation of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) be determined without any additional information about intermediate states?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) involves integrating the state over a time interval, which depends on the entire trajectory from time 0 to T. Without detailed information about the state at all intermediate times, one cannot retroactively compute \\\\( h(x) \\\\) solely from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
