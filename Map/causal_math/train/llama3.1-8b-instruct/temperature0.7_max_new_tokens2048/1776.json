  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time t according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven a certain observed function state at t = T, can we precisely ascertain which transformations (\\\\( H(z) \\\\) or \\\\( K(z) \\\\), or both) were performed, solely based on the state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Similar end states at t = T might be achieved through different combinations or sequences of applying \\\\( H(z) \\\\) and \\\\( K(z) \\\\) due to the overlaps in how the transformations affect the evolution of the function. Each possible path could lead to similar integrals, confirming the interventions uniquely is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
