  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and we study its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the final state of \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at some time T, can we determine whether there was an intervention with \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at time T is a result of the convolution of past states affected by any interventions and the exponential decay. Multiple combinations of interventions and initial conditions could result in the same final output, making it impossible to conclusively identify specific interventions solely based on the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
