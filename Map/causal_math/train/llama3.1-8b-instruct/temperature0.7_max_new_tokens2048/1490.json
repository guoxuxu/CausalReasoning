  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nCan we deduce the original function at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) was initiated, the complex exponential can reach the same state at different times due to its periodic nature. The presence of the power \\\\( k \\\\) in possible scenarios creates multiple, non-unique original states \\\\( z(t_0) \\\\) from which \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could have evolved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
