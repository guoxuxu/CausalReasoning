  "Problem": "Imagine a scenario in which a heat distribution in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. We explore the implications of an initial condition changed by a function \\\\( f(x) = u(x, 0) e^{\\lambda x} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( g(x) = e^{mx}u(x, t_1) \\\\) (where m is a constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined exclusively by the heat transport properties (k) and initial condition modification \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) introduces a secondary modification to the temperature profile, further influencing the evolution of the system. The final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will thus depend on \\\\( m \\\\), \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), as well as the heat conduction constant \\\\( k \\\\). This intervention changes the functional form and propagation characteristics of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
