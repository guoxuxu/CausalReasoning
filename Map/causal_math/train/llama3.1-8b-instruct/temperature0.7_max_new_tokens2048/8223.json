  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Laplace Transform. Let \\( f(t) \\) be a function such that \\( f(t) = t^2 \\). We intervene by adding a constant \\( k \\) to \\( f(t) \\), modifying it to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( f(t) \\) to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\), will the resulting transform only depend on the unmodified \\( f(t) \\) and not on \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( k \\) directly affects the result. The Laplace Transform of \\( t^2 + k \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} + \\frac{k}{s} \\). This addition changes the transform output to depend significantly on the value of \\( k \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
