  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is considered, which affects the function over time span [0, T].\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the solution of \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\) hold the same properties as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved from 0 to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) involves an integral operator which fundamentally alters the properties of the function z. Specifically, it introduces a damping factor \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), which modifies the amplitude and can alter phase characteristics of the original function, thus changing its trajectory and final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
