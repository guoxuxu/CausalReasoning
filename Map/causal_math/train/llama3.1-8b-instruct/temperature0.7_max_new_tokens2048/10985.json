  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy\\\\), with A and C being constant matrices. Consider the effect of the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) over time t, where B is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the complex vector \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the combined dynamics of \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under these dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition, resulting in a trajectory distinct from simple evolution under \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). Depending on how \\\\( B \\\\) interacts with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), the subsequent path and final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can significantly diverge from the natural progression of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
