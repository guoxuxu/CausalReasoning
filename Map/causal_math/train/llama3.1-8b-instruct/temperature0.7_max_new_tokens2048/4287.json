  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function is altered to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\delta t}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\delta \\\\) is a real constant, and the Laplace transform is recalculated, will the new transform be solely dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\delta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to a product of two exponentials, yielding \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i(\\omega+\\delta) t} \\\\). The new Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\omega+\\delta)} \\\\). Hence, the outcome depends both on the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( \\delta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
