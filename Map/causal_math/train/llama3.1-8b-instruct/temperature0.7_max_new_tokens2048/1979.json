  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Examine the influence of introducing an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int k(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) where \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different integral transformation \\\\( S(u) = \\\\int m(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) (where \\\\( m(x, y) \\\\) is another kernel) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on k(x, y) or m(x, y)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces an additional modification of the system's state, making the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) dependent not solely on L but also significantly influenced by both kernels k and m. The collective effects of these transformations shape the ultimate behavior of u at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
