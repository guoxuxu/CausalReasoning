  "Problem": "Analyze a complex dynamical system represented by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and z is a complex function. The evolution is studied under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T equate to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) for time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, affecting the evolution of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could alter the complex dynamics by interacting with the matrix C, the resultant state at time T could differ significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
