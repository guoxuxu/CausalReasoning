  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x)e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x)\\\\) is a spatial profile and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the frequency of oscillation. The function represents a wave-like solution to the wave equation. We apply a Fourier transform in time, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), to derive frequency domain characteristics and investigate potential changes induced by a spatial transformation \\\\(G(x) = x^2\\\\).\n\nIf an additional spatial transformation \\\\(H(x) = \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\) is applied at a later time \\\\(t=T\\\\), will the resulting wave function \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) retain the initial frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the application of an additional spatial transformation, the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) intrinsic to the temporal part of the wave function remains unchanged. Such transformations modify spatial characteristics but do not influence the temporal frequency set by \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
