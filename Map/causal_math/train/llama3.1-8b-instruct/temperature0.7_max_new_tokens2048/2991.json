  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z'(t) = z(t)e^{ct} \\) at some \\( t_1 \\geq 0 \\), where \\( c \\) is a real number, is the Laplace transform of this new function given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z'(t)\\} \\) still a simple rational function of \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z'(t) = e^{(a+c + bi)t} \\), and its Laplace transform is \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+c+bi)} \\). This remains a simple rational function in \\( s \\), but with a shifted pole.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
