  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf the final observed Fourier transform is \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\gamma) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence and values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) used in the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The final shift \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) in the Fourier transform represents the sum of shifts produced by the two exponential operations, but it does not reveal the individual contributions or order of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Different combinations of these complex numbers could result in the same total shift, making it impossible to distinguish the specifics of each intervention solely based on the final observed shift.",
