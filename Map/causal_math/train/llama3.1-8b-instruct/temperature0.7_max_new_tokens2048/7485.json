  "Problem": "Consider the interaction between two functions defined over scalar fields, \\\\( u(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( v(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where a and b are constants, in the context of an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left( h(z) \\\\right) = \\\\int_0^z u(\\\\tau) v(z - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( h(0) = h_0 \\\\) is set and the system is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( h(z) \\\\) solely depend on the parameters a and b of the functions u and v?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( h(z) \\\\) of the integro-differential equation is defined by the convolution of \\\\( u(z) \\\\) and \\\\( v(z) \\\\) and the initial condition \\\\( h_0 \\\\). It inherently depends only on the parameters a and b through the defined convolution, without involvement of any other external parameters or modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
