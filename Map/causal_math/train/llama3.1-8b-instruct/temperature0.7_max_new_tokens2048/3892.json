  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function to analyze is \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number. The transformations are evaluated for their effect on the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over a variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nFrom the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely from the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact interventions from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated by the compound effects of the exponential transformations, where both \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bz} \\\\) can independently or jointly influence the final outcome. The overlapping effects render it challenging to precisely discern which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
