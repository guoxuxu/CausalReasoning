  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the path taken by z in the complex plane from 0 to z without knowing whether any transformation has been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depends on the path of integration in the complex plane. Multiple paths can give rise to the same integral value due to the multi-valued nature of the complex exponential function and potential loops around singularities or branch cuts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
