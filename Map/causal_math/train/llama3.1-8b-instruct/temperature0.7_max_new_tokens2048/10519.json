  "Problem": "Consider the system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\Delta u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diffusion constant and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplacian operator. This equation is initially transformed by \\\\( v(x, t_0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x, t_0) e^{ikx} dx \\\\), which represents the Fourier transform at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nSuppose a modulation by a function \\\\( g(x) = e^{ax} \\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < t \\\\) as an intervention. Will the endpoint \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) depend only on the diffusion constant \\\\( D \\\\) and not on the details of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the function in real space, which changes its Fourier transform. Since the Fourier transform shifts (is modulated by a factor depending on \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\)), this alteration influences the endpoint \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\), thereby making it dependent not only on \\\\( D \\\\) but also on the specific nature of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
