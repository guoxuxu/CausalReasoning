  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a real variable y depends on x through the relation \\(y = x^2 + 2x + 1\\). We study the transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) and examine its impact on y, in the context of solving the related differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x + 2 \\).\n\nGiven that we observed \\( y = 6 \\) at \\( x = 1 \\), can we definitely conclude which transformation or set of transformations (either \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both) was used, based solely on \\( y \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( y = 6 \\) and \\( x = 1 \\), it's impossible to ascertain solely from this output which transformations were applied. Since multiple paths (like applying no transformation to x, using \\( g(x) \\) followed by \\( h(x) \\), etc.) can lead to \\( x = 1 \\) where \\( y = 6 \\), the causal inference of transformations isn't definitive without additional context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
