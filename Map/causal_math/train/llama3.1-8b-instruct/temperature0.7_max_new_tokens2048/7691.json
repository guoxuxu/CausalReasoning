  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subjected to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant complex number. Analyze how the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) affects z over time t, where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Vt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( V \\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend strictly on \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( U \\\\) or \\\\( V \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\), and how they interact with \\\\( D \\\\), affect the trajectory up to time \\\\( T \\\\). Each transformation introduces multiplicative factors that can alter the rate and direction of growth or decay of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the state at T dependent on all constants involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
