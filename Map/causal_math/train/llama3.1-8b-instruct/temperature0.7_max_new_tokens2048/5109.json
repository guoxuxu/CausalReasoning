  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, and it evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. Analyze the scenario where a Laplace transform, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(s)) \\\\), is applied, modifying the system's behaviour.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T equal what it would have been if \\\\( z_0(s) \\\\) had been directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the system by changing its domain and initial conditions. Thus, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from this new initial state under \\\\( \\\\dot{z}=i\\\\omega z \\\\) will not coincide with the untransformed initial conditions at time T due to the alteration in both the amplitude and phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
