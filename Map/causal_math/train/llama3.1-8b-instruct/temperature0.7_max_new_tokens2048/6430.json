  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex vector. The function is subject to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[w(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}w(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied directly or after some evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information on the application timeline of \\\\( T[w(t)] \\\\), it is impossible to ascertain the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) merely from the transformed outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) due to the integral transformation's potential alteration of the vector's trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
