  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\), where C is a matrix and D is a vector constant. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Mz + N \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector, at an initial time t = 0.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = Pz + Q \\\\) (where P is another constant matrix and Q is another constant vector) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), T > t_1, reflect only the influence of matrix C and not the transformations by M or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) adds additional complexity to the system evolution, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on all applied transformations - M, P as well as matrix C. The changes introduced by P and Q at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) also modify the trajectory substantially, leading to a composite effect influenced by all parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
