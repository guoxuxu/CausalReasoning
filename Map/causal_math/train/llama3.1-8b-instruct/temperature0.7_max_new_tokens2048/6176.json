  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Kz \\\\), where K is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\), which transforms the function to \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{z(0)}{s-K} \\\\), and its inverse on the function's evolution over time.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that an intervention changed \\\\( K \\\\) to \\\\( M \\\\), can we uniquely determine the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple scenarios could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the continuous and exponential nature of the function’s evolution. The specifics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) do not isolate \\\\( t_1 \\\\) uniquely, as similar states can be achieved with different timing and duration of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
