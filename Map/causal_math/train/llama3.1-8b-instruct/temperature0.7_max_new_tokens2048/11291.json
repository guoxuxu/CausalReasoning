  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We're evaluating the effect of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}s ds \\\\) applied to a function z(t), where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where a different operator \\\\( U(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Et}s ds \\\\) (with E as a constant matrix) is used, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions change the trajectory and potential outcomes of the function z by using different integral transformations. The system state at T depends on the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) followed by \\\\( U(z) \\\\), making the end state influenced by matrices D, E, and C. The combination of these transformations affects how the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolves.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
