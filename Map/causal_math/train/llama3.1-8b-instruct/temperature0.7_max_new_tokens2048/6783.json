  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) before the transformation, where \\\\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific moment during the transformation of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) by \\\\( G(s) \\\\), an intervention changes the function to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) by another operator \\\\( M \\\\) where \\\\( Mh(x) = x^2h(x) \\\\), will the final transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) only depend on the initial function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M \\\\) changing the function to \\\\( x^2h(x) \\\\) significantly modifies the final transform to involve the second derivative \\\\( G''(s) \\\\) (again due to integration by parts). Hence, the final transform depends critically on the details of both the initial function and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
