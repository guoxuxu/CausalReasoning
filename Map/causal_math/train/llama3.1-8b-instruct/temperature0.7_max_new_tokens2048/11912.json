  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex domain, defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane. Evaluate the transformations on this function using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), where the Laplace transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any modification and the resulting function is then inverse-transformed back to the time domain, does the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remain unaltered?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, followed by its inverse, theoretically restores the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). However, due to the nature of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which involves exponential growth in the imaginary direction, standard Laplace transform scenarios require convergence considerations. Assuming analytical continuation or extensions that can handle such functions, the original function is restored.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
