  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to this equation, and subsequently manipulating the transformed equation.\n\nGiven the solution at time T (let's call it \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)), can we determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "In linear PDEs, knowing the solution at any time allows us to trace back to the initial conditions due to the linearity and reversibility of both the PDE and the Fourier transform used. The application of the transform does not affect this reversibility.",
