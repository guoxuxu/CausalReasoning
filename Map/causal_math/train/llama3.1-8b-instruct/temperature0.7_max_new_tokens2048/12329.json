  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation is applied: \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a heating function.\n\nCan the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be accurately determined at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the effect at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could result from various initial conditions modified by different forms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Since the heat equation is sensitive to initial conditions and additional heating terms, lacking this information precludes unequivocal determination of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
