  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform, which we denote as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) = F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\), can we precisely trace back to conclude that the original function was definitely \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\) without other possibilities?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\) suggests a exponential form with a complex frequency, it alone isn't sufficient to uniquely determine that the input was specifically \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\), as other factors or additional transformations might have been present initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
