  "Problem": "Consider the impact of applying a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t)\\\\), resulting in \\\\( G(w) \\\\), and then investigating how this transform influences solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix. The situation explores the connection between the manipulation of function domains using integral transformations and their effect on dynamical system evolution.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( G(w) \\\\) is calculated from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and then used to drive the dynamical system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), will the system's state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T be solely determined by \\\\( D \\\\) and unaffected by the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will also depend on the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) because its Fourier transform \\\\( G(w) \\\\) directly influences the system's driving factors. The solution to the differential equation will vary depending on both the structure of the matrix \\\\( D \\\\) and the spectrum contained in \\\\( G(w) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
