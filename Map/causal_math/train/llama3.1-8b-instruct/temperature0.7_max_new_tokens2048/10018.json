  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without knowing the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Unless the specific initial conditions and the constants A, B, C, D are known, the effect of the phase transformation introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can't be uniquely deduced from the final state alone, especially due to the indistinguishable effects of complex exponentials over system evolution.",
