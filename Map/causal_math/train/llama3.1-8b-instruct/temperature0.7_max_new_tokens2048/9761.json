  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time and represent the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The function is subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), and the transformed function is \\\\(Z(s)\\\\). We also consider the effect of multiplying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by a factor of \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant, before transforming.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is transformed directly by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) without multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) show a shift in the complex plane compared to transforming after multiplying by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The direct Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without the factor \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) results in \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), while multiplying by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) before transforming shifts the argument to \\\\(s-a\\\\). This results in the transform \\\\(Z(s-a)\\\\), which represents a shift in the complex plane compared to \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), reflecting changes in the convergence properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
