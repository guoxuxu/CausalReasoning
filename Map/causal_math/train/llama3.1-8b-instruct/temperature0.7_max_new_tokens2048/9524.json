  "Problem": "In a fluid dynamics context, we consider the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. To study the effect of a varying thermal diffusivity, a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modulates \\\\( k \\\\) as \\\\( k(t) = k_0 h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k_0 \\\\) being the initial thermal diffusivity.\n\nIf we know the final temperature profile \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\), can we identify with certainty the exact nature of any interventions made on \\\\( h(t) \\\\), such as the timing and magnitude of changes?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention profiles can lead to similar final states due to the diffusion nature of the equation and the potentially infinite combinations of initial conditions and changes in \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The final temperature alone does not uniquely specify past interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
