  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's behavior is explored under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Kx}u \\\\), where K is a constant matrix and x represents spatial coordinates.\n\nIf at a certain point (x1, t1), a new function \\\\( i(u) = e^{Mx}u \\\\) (where M is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(X,T) \\\\) for X > x1 and T > t1 depend only on L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( i(u) \\\\) adds additional complexity to the system's evolution, making the final state \\\\( u(X,T) \\\\) influenced by K, M, as well as L. The transformations introduced by \\\\( e^{Kx} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Mx} \\\\) affect the system's behavior and the final output at (X, T) through their respective impacts on the system's spatial structure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying an intervention i(u) at a point (x1, t1) will cause u(X, T) for X > x1 and T > t1 to depend on the initial conditions of u, the constant matrix L, and the constant matrices K and M, but not on the spatial coordinates x."
