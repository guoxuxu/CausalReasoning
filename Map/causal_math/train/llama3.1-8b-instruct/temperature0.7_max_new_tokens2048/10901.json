  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex number. We are exploring how the function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) impacts z over time t, where Q is another complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) until time t = T without further intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) equal the state if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), by introducing \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), changes the initial state, and thus the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be modified by the factor e^(Q T), resulting in a different state at time t = T than if it were evolved only under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
