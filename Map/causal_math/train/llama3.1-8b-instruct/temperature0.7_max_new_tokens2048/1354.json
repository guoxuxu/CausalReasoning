  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position coordinates over time. We study the effect of a Laplace Transform \\\\( F(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(p) \\\\) which transforms the complex-valued function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nFrom the transformed function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we unequivocally determine the original time at which the sudden change occurred in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without other prior information?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace Transform captures all characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), inferring the exact time of sudden changes from \\\\( F(p) \\\\) alone is non-trivial without additional information, since multiple time-domain changes can lead to similar features in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
