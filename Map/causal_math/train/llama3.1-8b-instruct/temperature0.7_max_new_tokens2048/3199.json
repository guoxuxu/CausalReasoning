  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, often represented as \\\\( a = b + ci \\\\). We examine how the function responds to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), and we analyze situations both with and without interventions defined by multiplying by another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{dt} \\\\), where \\\\( d \\\\) is a real number, is applied to modify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, will the resulting transform function explicitly reveal the initial value of \\\\( ci \\\\) without knowledge of \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to become \\\\( e^{(b+c+d)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform subsequently yields \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - (b + c + d)} \\\\), which obscures the separate contributions of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). Therefore, without knowing \\\\( d \\\\), we lose direct access to the value of \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
