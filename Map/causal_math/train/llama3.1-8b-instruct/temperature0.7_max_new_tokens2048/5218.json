  "Problem": "Consider the transfer function of a linear system represented by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. We investigate the system's response to complex inputs and the effect of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of a system characterized by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the input waveform exclusively based on the output spectrum?",
  "Explanation": "In linear systems, different input signals may result in the same output spectrum, especially when considering phase variations and the potential for additive noise or other distortions not captured by a simple spectral analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
