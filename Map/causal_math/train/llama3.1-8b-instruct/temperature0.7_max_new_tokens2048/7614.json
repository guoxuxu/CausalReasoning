  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nGiven a measurement of the fluid's velocity field at various points, can we uniquely determine the values of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) without knowing their initial proportions?",
  "Explanation": "The fluid's velocity field is influenced by both \\\\( U \\\\) (affecting the magnitude of uniform flow) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) (affecting the strength of the source), resulting in multiple combinations of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) that could produce similar velocity measurements. Without additional constraints or knowledge of proportions, these parameters cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
