  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a linear operator in a complex function space, and \\\\( x \\\\) is an initial complex function. We explore the impacts of a Laplace transform intervention defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), analyzing its interactions over various scenarios.\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does this influence the transformation such that the behavior for times greater than \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is only contingent on the operator A?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform fundamentally changes the nature of the function, converting it into a function of complex variable s. This alteration makes the subsequent behavior dependent not just on A, but also on the complex structure introduced by the Laplace transform, which isn't solely dictated by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
