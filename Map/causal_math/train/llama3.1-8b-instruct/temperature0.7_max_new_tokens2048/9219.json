  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network where the voltage across a circuit element is governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) = H(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represents the complex impedance of the element and \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is the transformed input current. The effect of an intervention by adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to the system is studied.\n\nConsider that at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is added in parallel. Will the new voltage \\\\( V'(s) \\\\) at any time after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend only upon \\\\( I(s) \\\\) and not on the nature of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a new impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in parallel modifies the overall impedance of the circuit. The resultant voltage, \\\\( V'(s) \\\\) will depend on both the input current and the combined effect of the impedances \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) since the overall impedance of the circuit changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
