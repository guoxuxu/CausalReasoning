  "Problem": "Examine the dynamic system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) dx \\\\) applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is performed on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to directly computing the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and time-invariance of L combined with the properties of the Fourier transform ensure that evolving the transformed initial state under the Fourier-transformed operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(L) \\\\) results in a state that matches the Fourier transform of the system's state at any later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
