  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\\\) over a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u = f \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). We examine the result of initial transformations using the eigenfunction expansions of \\\\( u \\\\) and how tool-based interventions like Laplacian solvers act.\n\nCan the application of the Laplacian solver, used at a specific point during the system's evolution, be definitively determined from the final state \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) observed within \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects observed in \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) can result from various interventions similar in nature, such as different tuning parameters of Laplacian solvers or other stabilizing/analytic methods. Thereby, establishing a unique link to a specific intervention just from the final state is not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
