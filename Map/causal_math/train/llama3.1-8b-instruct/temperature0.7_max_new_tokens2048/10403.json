  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Now introduce a change of basis driven by a matrix function \\\\( P(t) \\\\), leading to a new variable \\\\( y = P(t)x \\\\). Analyze the transformation's impacts under various scenarios.\n\nIf an intervention in terms of a secondary transformation \\\\( Q(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) such that the new variable becomes \\\\( z(t) = Q(t)y(t) \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from compounded transformations involving \\\\( P(t) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(t) \\\\), and thus depends on A, B, and C. The matrix exponentials introduce their own effects on the evolution, making the final state a function of the interplay between all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
