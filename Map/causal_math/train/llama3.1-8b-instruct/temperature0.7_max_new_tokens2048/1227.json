  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), and its subsequent evolution.\n\nIf an intervention through a different integral transform, say a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at T > t_1 solely depend on L and not on the properties of the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform as an intervention introduces additional complexity to the system's behavior, making the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) dependent on the interaction of the Laplace and Fourier transforms with the differential operator L. This dependency alters the final form of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
