  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a function space, described by the integral transform \\\\(T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s)f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(x, s)\\\\) is the kernel function. We examine the transformation's behavior when the function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is introduced, and how adding a multiplication by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) as an intervention affects transformations.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\) after observing \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) without knowing whether any transformation alteration was applied to \\\\(f(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether and what transformations might have been applied to \\\\(f(s)\\\\) prior to or within \\\\(T\\\\), reconstructing the exact form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\) would be ambiguous. Different functions can yield the same or indistinguishable outputs under certain kernel functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
