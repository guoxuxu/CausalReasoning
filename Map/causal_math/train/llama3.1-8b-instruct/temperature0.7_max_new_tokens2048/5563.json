  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a complex constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore how the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}f(z) \\\\, dt \\\\) affects causal inference.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied along with the original transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) and the system continues to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be influenced solely by \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) = z^3 \\\\) as an intervention alters the trajectory further by the cubic transformation inside the integral, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) but also the functional form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and its integration. This results in a compounded interaction affecting the final condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
