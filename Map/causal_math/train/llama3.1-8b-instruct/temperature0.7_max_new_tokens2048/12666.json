  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( F(z) = z^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied on functions derived from \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time, a new transformation function \\\\( G(z) = z + c \\\\) (where c is a constant complex number) is applied to the result of \\\\( F(z_0) \\\\), then \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is recalculated to reflect this change, will the new Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) reflect changes only due to \\\\( G \\\\) and ignore the original \\\\( F(z) = z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new Laplace transform will not only depend on the G transformation but will inherently be affected by the original function \\\\( F \\\\). The operations \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and then \\\\( (z^2 + c) \\\\) mean the overall change is a combined effect and one cannot be isolated without the other in the final calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
