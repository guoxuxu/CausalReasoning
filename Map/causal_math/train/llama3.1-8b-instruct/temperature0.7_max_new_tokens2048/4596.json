  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\( g(x) \\) defined on \\([0, \\infty)\\) given by \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\), often referred to as the Laplace Transform. We are investigating the effects of pre-multiplying \\( g(x) \\) by another function \\( h(x) \\), resulting in \\( H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx \\).\n\nGiven the transformed outcome \\( H(s) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( k(x) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same outcome \\( H(s) \\) can potentially result from different functions \\( h(x) \\) and \\( k(x) \\) due to properties of the Laplace Transform such as linearity and shifting. Without additional information about the interventions, it is not possible to uniquely identify from \\( H(s) \\) alone which modifications were made.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
