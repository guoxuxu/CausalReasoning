  "Problem": "Analyze a network system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region, where u represents potential at any point. An external field represented by the function \\\\( v(x, y, z) = e^{Ax + By + Cz} \\\\) (A, B, C are constants) is applied to the region at time t = 0.\n\nAssuming the external field \\\\( v(x, y, z) \\\\) is applied and then the system is allowed to evolve under the Laplace equation without further intervention, will the potential distribution \\\\( u(x, y, z, T) \\\\) at any later time T be purely determined by the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the external field \\\\( v(x, y, z) \\\\) alters the initial conditions of the system, thereby affecting the resulting potential distribution at any later time. The influence of \\\\( v \\\\) introduces a non-zero condition that deviates from the solutions solely governed by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
