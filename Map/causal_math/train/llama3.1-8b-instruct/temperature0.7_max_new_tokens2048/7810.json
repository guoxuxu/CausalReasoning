  "Problem": "In the context of control theory, consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the state-space equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is the input matrix. We examine how the integral transformation defined by \\\\( x_{new}(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) impacts the system's behavior with respect to input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any time t, can we uniquely determine the input history \\\\( u(\\\\tau) \\\\) for 0 \\\\leq \\\\tau \\\\leq t without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential non-invertibility of the matrix exponential and presence of modes that might not be observable or controllable, \\\\( x(t) \\\\) alone doesn't necessarily allow us to uniquely backtrack and determine \\\\( u(\\\\tau) \\\\) without knowing initial conditions or having additional constraints or data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
