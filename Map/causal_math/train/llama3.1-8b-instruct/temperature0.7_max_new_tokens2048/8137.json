  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), with \\( M \\) being a complex matrix. Investigate how the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\), affects the dynamics of \\( z(t) \\), where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable.\n\nIf \\( Z(s) \\) is computed for an initial condition \\( z(0) \\) and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\) without further intervention, will the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) solely rely on the form of \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\( z(t) \\) is primarily determined by the matrix \\( M \\). As the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\) inherently encodes the dynamics dictated by \\( M \\), any observed behavior at time \\( T \\) follows directly from these dynamics without influence from external modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
