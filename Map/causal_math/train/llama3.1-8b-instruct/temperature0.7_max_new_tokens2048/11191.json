  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where L is another linear operator and S is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( k(x) = Q^{-1}e^{Dt}Qx \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix and Q an invertible matrix) is applied, will the ultimate state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on L, D, or transformations S or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(x) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics represented by \\\\( D \\\\) and the transformation matrix \\\\( Q \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) becomes a result of composite effects from M, L, and D, and the transformations brought about by matrices S and Q. As a result, dependencies extend beyond merely M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
