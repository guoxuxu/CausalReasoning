  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\) in a two-dimensional space. We inquire about the impacts via transformations represented by \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) and subsequent linear transformations \\\\( h(x, y) = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) to a point \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) and then compute \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) over the transformed coordinates, will the resultant \\\\( z \\\\) value at those coordinates be the same as calculating \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) directly on \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) fundamentally alters the coordinates, radically changing values due to the exponential increase, which leads to a different resultant \\\\( z \\\\) when computed at the new coordinates compared to the original ones.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
