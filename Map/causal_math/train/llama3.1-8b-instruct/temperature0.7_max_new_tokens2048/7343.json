  "Problem": "Consider a model for the propagation of a signal \\\\(s(t)\\\\) through a medium, where the signal is initially transformed by a function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kx} \\\\), and the medium's response is modeled by a linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear operator. The propagation is analyzed at various times t under different transformations.\n\nIf at time t = t1 a new transformation \\\\( g(y) = e^{My} \\\\) is applied to the signal as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend solely on the operator L and not on K or M?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation \\\\( g(y) \\\\) sets a different trajectory for the signal's evolution under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Lu \\\\). This means that the end state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is determined by the initial transformation \\\\( K \\\\), the intervention \\\\( M \\\\), and the dynamics of L, making it dependent on all these elements.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
