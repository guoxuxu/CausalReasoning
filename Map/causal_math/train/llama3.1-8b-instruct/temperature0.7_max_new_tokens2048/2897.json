  "Problem": "Consider a system where complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. To investigate the relationship, we introduce a transformation with the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without any further modification, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to having evolved \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{D0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t = 0; however, the influence of \\\\( D \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) over time changes the development path from what would be solely influenced by \\\\( C \\\\), thus resulting in a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
