  "Problem": "In a complex domain, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The time evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider alterations in this system's behavior by applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precise the nature of interventions applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), by solely examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations and sequencing of transformations represented by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Due to the properties of complex exponentials and the potential overlapping effects, it is not feasible to definitively distinguish between interventions or their order solely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
