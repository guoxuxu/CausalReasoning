  "Problem": "Consider the linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. Assess the effects of transforming the system with the operator \\\\( T(x) = Mx + N \\\\), where M and N are matrices and N is not necessarily zero.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we distinctly identify which transformations were performed (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( U(x) \\\\), or both), merely based on the observed \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlapping influences of matrices M, N, P, and Q in changing the system's trajectory, distinguishing between applications of \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( U(x) \\\\) or their collective effect, solely based on the final state, is ambiguous. Multiple different transformations could lead to the same observed endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
