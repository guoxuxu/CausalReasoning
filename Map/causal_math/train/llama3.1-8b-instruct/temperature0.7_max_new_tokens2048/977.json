  "Problem": "Assuming a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. A Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it to a new domain.\n\nIf you know the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = s_0 \\\\) and let the system evolve under the original differential equations without further intervention, will the behavior of the original system \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform encodes complete information about \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the transformed domain under \\\\( F(s_0) \\\\) could lead to different interpretations or solutions, depending on initial conditions and the behavior of the inverse Laplace across the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
