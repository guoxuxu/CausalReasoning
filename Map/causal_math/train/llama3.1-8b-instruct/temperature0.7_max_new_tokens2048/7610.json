  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\(z(t)\\) described by the differential equation \\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\(\\omega\\) is a real constant frequency. Now analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( T(z(T)) \\) at time \\( T \\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) results in an integral that blends the values of \\( z(t) \\) over the interval from 0 to \\( T \\), with each value weighted by \\( e^{-i\\omega s} \\). This operation masks the individual contributions of \\( z(s) \\) at different times, making it impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\( z(0) \\) from \\( T(z(T)) \\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
