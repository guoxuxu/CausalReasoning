  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by the Laplace operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s)\\\\), examining the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and its transformation \\\\\\\\(( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\)). We then intervene by applying a transformation through the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{t}f(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes the standard Laplace transformation of \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) to \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) without any further transformation ensure the effect follows directly and uniquely from the cause?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation from \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) to its Laplace equivalent \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) is determined directly by the properties of the Laplace transform, which maps each function to a unique transform in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
