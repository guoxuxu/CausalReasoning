  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time is investigated.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is taken over time t without further intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} (s) \\\\) at a complex number s be solely determined by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without any dependence on initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a predefined function and the Laplace transform is a linear operator dependent only on this function and not on any specific initial value or state, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} (s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) is determined solely by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
