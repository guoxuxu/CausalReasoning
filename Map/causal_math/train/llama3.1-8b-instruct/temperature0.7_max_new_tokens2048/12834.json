  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of electrical impedance in a circuit as a function of the frequency, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega) = R + \\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C} + j\\\\omega L\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) are resistance, capacitance, and inductance respectively, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Z(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to study the system's response.\n\nIf a capacitor of a different value is added in parallel at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) while observing the frequency response, will the resulting impedance function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega, t)\\\\) at any time \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) solely be determined by the original components \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new capacitor alters the total capacitance of the circuit, which affects the overall impedance, particularly the part contributed by the capacitive reactance. Thus, both the original and the new capacitances influence the impedance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
