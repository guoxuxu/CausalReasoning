  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations and timings of the interventions due to the complex exponential terms \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\) affecting both the phase and magnitude in overlapping ways. This makes it impossible to determine the specifics of interventions uniquely from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
