  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We also consider a Laplace transformation, where \\\\(L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt\\\\) is applied.\n\nCan we recover the exact original function \\\\(z_0\\\\) after observing its Laplace transform \\\\(L(z)(s)\\\\) at a later time without knowing if it evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, while uniquely representing a function, loses specific time-domain details that are irreversible without knowing the evolution process and initial conditions explicitly, especially under complex differential dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
