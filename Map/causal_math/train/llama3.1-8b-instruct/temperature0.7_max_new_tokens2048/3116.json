  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{ct}z_0\\\\) applied on initial complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. The system is further governed by another complex function \\\\(w(z) = e^{dz}w_0\\\\), where \\\\(d\\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\(w_0\\\\) is the initial state of another dependent complex variable.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\), can we determine precisely what modifications (whether \\\\(z(t)\\\\), \\\\(u(z)\\\\), or both) were applied to the system?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\) could result from various combinations and orders of applying complex exponential functions. Given the complex exponential nature of these transformations and possible overlapping effects, deducing the exact sequence or type of interventions from only the final state is non-trivial and ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
