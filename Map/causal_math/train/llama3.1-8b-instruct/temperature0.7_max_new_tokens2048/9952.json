  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of matrices within a linear differential equation system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a matrix. Consider the influence of a linear transformation defined by the matrix P, applied as \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = P\\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) at time t, can we definitively identify the specific transformation (P and/or Q) used, considering the knowledge of only the current state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying interventions solely based on the end state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) is intricate because different combinations of P, Q, and interaction times could lead to similar outcomes at t. The transformations' effects might mask each other, making it challenging to ascertain which were actually applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
