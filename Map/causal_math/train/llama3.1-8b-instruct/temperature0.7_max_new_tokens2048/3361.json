  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( z = Z \\\\) under \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the input of the function, leading to \\\\( f(T(z_0)) = e^{a(cz_0 + d)} \\\\), which is distinct from \\\\( f(z_0) = e^{az_0} \\\\) due to the additional multiplication and shift by \\\\( d \\\\). This changes the function's output for any non-zero \\\\( d \\\\) and scaling factor \\\\( c \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
