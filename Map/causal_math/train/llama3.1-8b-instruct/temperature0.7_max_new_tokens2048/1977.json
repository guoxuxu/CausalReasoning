  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Examine the influence of introducing an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int k(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) where \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) changes the initial condition by modifying the spatial distribution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) according to the kernel \\\\( k(x,y) \\\\), creating a different evolution path under the operator L, thus affecting the state at time T differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
