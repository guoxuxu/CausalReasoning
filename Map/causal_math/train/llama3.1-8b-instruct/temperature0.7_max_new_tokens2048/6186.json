  "Problem": "Consider a system where a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) undergoes a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where A is a constant complex number. The function influences the trajectory over time t.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) be accurately determined from observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after time T, without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied before evolving the system?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, there are multiple possible original values \\\\(z_0\\\\) that could have been altered in a way that results in the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\). The effect of A on the trajectory introduces ambiguity in deducing \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(T); T → f(z); A → f(z); f(z) → z(T); T → z(T); z_0 → z(t); A → z(t); z(t) → z(T)"
