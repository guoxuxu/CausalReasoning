  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real frequency. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) without clarity on whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied leaves ambiguity. The scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) could significantly alter \\\\( z_0 \\\\), making it impossible to retrieve the initial value uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
