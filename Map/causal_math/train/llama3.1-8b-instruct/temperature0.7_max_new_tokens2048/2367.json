  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a matrix-based system with the equation \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(t) = P\\\\textbf{x}_0 + tQ\\\\textbf{x}_0\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\) are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(\\\\textbf{x}) = e^{Rt}\\\\textbf{x}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) is another constant matrix, at various points in time.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another transformation \\\\(h(\\\\textbf{x}) = e^{St}\\\\textbf{x}\\\\) (where \\\\(S\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the system state \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(P\\\\) and not on \\\\(Q\\\\), \\\\(R\\\\), or \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(h(\\\\textbf{x})\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) creates additional dynamics. The final state \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\) will be influenced by \\\\(P\\\\), \\\\(Q\\\\), \\\\(R\\\\), and \\\\(S\\\\) due to their distinct contributions and potential non-commutative interactions, modifying both the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\(\\\\textbf{x}(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
