  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system characterized by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}s \\\\, ds \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, applied to the system's state over time interval t.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The possible effects created by applying either or both transformations, due to their integral nature and the possibility of overlapping transformations affecting the system's state in non-distinguishable ways, make it impossible to decipher distinctly the interventions applied merely from observing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
