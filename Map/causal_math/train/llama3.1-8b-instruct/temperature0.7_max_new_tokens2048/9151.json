  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by an integral transformation using Laplace Transform with \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We focus on the consequences of modifying this system through a convolution with the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and the corresponding transformation in the Laplace domain is \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different convolution with function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome in the Laplace domain \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) depend solely on the initial transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on the new \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+b} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) introduces yet another transformation factor, making the resulting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The multiple convolutions influence the outcome non-trivially, thereby affecting the final transformed state in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
