  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - iw} \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) yields a unique function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) whose form clearly identifies the frequency \\\\( w \\\\) as the imaginary part of the pole, \\\\( w \\\\) can be precisely determined from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The Laplace transform of z(t) directly results in Z(s), and Z(s) is directly related to the parameter s. The parameter s is directly related to the imaginary unit i and the frequency w. The frequency w is directly related to the imaginary unit i and the parameter s. The transformed function Z(s) is directly related to the frequency w, as it is 1/(s - iw). Therefore, Z(s) directly reveals the frequency w without any ambiguity."
