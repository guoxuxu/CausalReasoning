  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 u = f(x, y)\\\\) on a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) with boundary conditions applied. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, is used to analyze the effects and causal relationships of applying different boundary interventions.\n\nCan we determine explicitly if the alterations in the solution \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) were due solely to changes in boundary conditions without considering changes to the source term, if these modifications were unrecorded but the endpoint solution \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise records of interventions, particularly alterations in boundary conditions or variations in source terms, it is challenging to deduce the exact type of intervention applied merely from the solution at time T. The overlap in potential effects from different interventions under the Poisson framework means it is not feasible to conclusively separate these influences just by analyzing the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Boundary conditions → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → Solution u(x, y, T); Source term → Solution u(x, y, T); Boundary conditions → Solution u(x, y, T); Solution u(x, y, T) → Endpoint solution u(x, y, T)"
