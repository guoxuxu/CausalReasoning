  "Problem": "Consider a complex system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial y^2} = -\\\\lambda u \\\\) with boundary conditions. We explore the system response under the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) and consider the dynamics when impacted by an operation \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(u) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t}\\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the initial function \\\\( u(x, y, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to its natural dynamics given by the PDE, will the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k_x, k_y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) be reflective of the evolution as if the transform was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator and preserves the dynamics under linear PDEs. Assuming the solution and its transform satisfy the same relation in the Fourier space, the transformed state will develop consistent with the PDE's natural evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
