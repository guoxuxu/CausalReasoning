  "Problem": "Consider the system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We study the implications of applying a transformation denoted by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on this system dynamics.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} = 1 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares the magnitude and doubles the angle, thus directly modifying the dynamics of the system from the initial point. Therefore, the result at any time T will not be the same as simple evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), since \\\\( f(z(0)) = 1^2 = 1 \\\\), but would otherwise be \\\\( e^{2iT} \\\\) due to doubling the initial angle.",
