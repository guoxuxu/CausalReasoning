  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1 > 0\\\\), an intervention \\\\(U(z) = Dz + E\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\) are also complex constants, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), or \\\\(E\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(U(z)\\\\) introduces additional transformation dependent on \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\), affecting the trajectory and final state of the system. Thus, the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will depend on all constants \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\), since both transformations can scale, shift, or otherwise modify the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
