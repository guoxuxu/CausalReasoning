  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) concerning the spatial variable x.\n\nCan we infer the original heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) exactly by knowing \\\\( U(s, t) \\\\) for some t > 0 without applying any inverse transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Though we can find \\\\( U(s, t) \\\\) by evolving \\\\( U(s, 0) \\\\), obtaining \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) from \\\\( U(s, t) \\\\) without explicitly carrying out the inverse Laplace transform is not feasible. Knowledge of only the transformed version \\\\( U(s, t) \\\\) doesn’t provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without reverting the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
