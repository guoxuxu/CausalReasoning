  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane, described by the relation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Consider the effect spatially shifting this function using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + Ce^{Bt} \\\\), where B and C are constant complex numbers.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer if the original initial condition was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0 + C \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately trace back to determine if the initial condition was strictly \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or modified by \\\\( C \\\\). The complex exponentials involved could place the endpoint in a location indistinguishable between starting conditions owing to the added complex dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
