  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We analyze the system’s behavior when exposed to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\), where D and N are constant matrices and D is diagonalizable.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention using a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Fe^{Qt}z \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied, does the new final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not the characteristics of D, N, or F and Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the trajectory of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), depending on the matrix F and the exponential term involving Q. Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) would depend on D, N (affecting the state prior to t_1) as well as F and Q, beyond just the original matrix M, affecting the system's entire evolution up to time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
