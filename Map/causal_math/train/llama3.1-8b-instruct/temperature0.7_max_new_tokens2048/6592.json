  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and A is a complex constant. The transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B being another complex constant.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely delineate which interventions (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on this endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly which interventions were applied is challenging without additional data regarding when and how these interventions (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were implemented. The overlapping effects of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) in conjunction with \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) yield a state that could arise from diverse transformative sequences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
