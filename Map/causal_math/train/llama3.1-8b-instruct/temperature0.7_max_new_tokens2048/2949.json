  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\to f(e^{kt} z) \\\\) is applied to the function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then evolves over time t without further intervention, will the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves a scaling and rotation in the complex plane, depending on k, this modifies the function's values along the contour. The integral will thus generally not be invariant unless f has specific properties (like holomorphy and k purely imaginary), or other special conditions are met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
