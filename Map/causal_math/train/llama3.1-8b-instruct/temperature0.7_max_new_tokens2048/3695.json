  "Problem": "Consider the system given by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of the system under the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\), and its inverse Laplace Transform.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^t f(t) \\\\) is applied at a certain point, and then both are transformed using the Laplace Transform, will the resultant function in the Laplace domain at any point only depend on the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) introduces an exponential function which, when combined with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) from the earlier transformation, affects the resulting Laplace Transform. Therefore, the resultant Laplace domain representation depends on both the nature of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and the new \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
