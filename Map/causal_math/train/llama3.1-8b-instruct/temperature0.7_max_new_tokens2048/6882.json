  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate changes in the function given by the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) \\\\), applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function in the Laplace domain, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), can we recover the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) uniquely without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) uniquely yields the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). The correspondence is direct and unambiguous in this specific context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
