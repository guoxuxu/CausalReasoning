  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + N \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of system states. The system's behavior is analyzed under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = C e^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine accurately what operations were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) based solely on the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) result can stem from different combinations and timings of the interventions \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\), due to the varied effects these matrix transformations might have on the system's trajectory. Thus, identifying the interventions precisely from the end state alone is challenging and not generally feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
