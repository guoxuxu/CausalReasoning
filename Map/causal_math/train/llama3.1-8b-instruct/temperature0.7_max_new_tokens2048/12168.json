  "Problem": "Consider a calculation involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The calculation examines the integral transformation across time t defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\int_0^T z(t) \\, dt \\\\) and impacts of interventions at different stages.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined from t = 0 to T, and the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied directly, will the outcome of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) be zero?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) over the interval from 0 to T is a fundamental integral in complex function theory, leading to the result \\\\( F(z) = \\frac{e^{i \\omega T} - 1}{i \\omega} \\\\). For certain values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and T (specifically when \\\\( \\omega T = 2\\pi k \\\\) for integer k), this expression simplifies to zero, indicating periods of the function complete full cycles within the interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
