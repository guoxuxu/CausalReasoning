  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of the convolution operation using a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\) with its transform \\\\( K(s) \\\\), on the system function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( (f*k)(t) \\\\) is applied initially and the result evolves naturally, will the output at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) alone was evolved without convolution up to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution modifies the input by integrating the effects of \\\\( k(t) \\\\) over \\\\( f(t) \\\\), altering the initial state and thus the system's response at any future time T differently than if unaltered \\\\( f(t) \\\\) were evolved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
