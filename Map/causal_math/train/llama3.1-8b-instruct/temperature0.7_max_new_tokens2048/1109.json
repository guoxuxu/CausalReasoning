  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system undergoing forced vibration governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = F(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) is the damping ratio, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency, and \\\\(F(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) represents external periodic forcing. We explore the consequences of applying a transformation through convolution with an impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\zeta\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\(F(t)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) to result in \\\\(F'(t)\\\\) and then this new function is used as input in the system, will the response \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the original unconvolved system's response at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Convolving \\\\(F(t)\\\\) with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) before inputting it into the system modifies the forcing function, altering the system's response over time. The convolution introduces a damping effect into the force, changing the frequency and amplitude characteristics of the input, thus the response \\\\(x(t)\\\\) will differ.",
