  "Problem": "Consider a function space influenced by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and consider the integral transform \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} K(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transform. The challenge is to assess how transformations and inverses of these operators affect the functions within this space.\n\nIf the kernel \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) of transform \\\\( T \\\\) is modified by linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further interventions, will the transformed function \\\\( T[f] \\\\) be affected solely by \\\\( L \\\\) when applied to any function \\\\( f \\\\) in the function space?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the kernel \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) by any linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) impacts the nature of the integral transform, thereby affecting the resultant transform \\\\( T[f] \\\\). This can lead to a different effect on \\\\( T[f] \\\\) compared to what would occur without \\\\( L \\\\)'s alteration of \\\\( K \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
