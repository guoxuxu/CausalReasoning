  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(T) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( T_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(T) \\\\) to modify the initial temperature distribution consequently alters the heat diffusion trajectory. Since \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) adds additional heat at various points, the evolved temperature distribution differs from the scenario without this addition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
