  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform in the context of varying parameters \\\\( s \\\\). We analyze how complex functions and integral transformations relate in the inference of causality.\n\nBased on the Laplace transform results of a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with a known intervention on matrix A, can we precisely identify the type and magnitude of intervention applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform masks specific details about temporal interventions on the matrix A due to its integral nature and dependence on global behavior of \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\). Multiple types or magnitudes of interventions may yield functionally similar outcomes in the transform domain, obscuring exact details about the interventions made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Known Intervention on A → Laplace Transform of f(z); Known Intervention on A → Type of Intervention; Known Intervention on A → Magnitude of Intervention; Laplace Transform of f(z) → Type of Intervention; Laplace Transform of f(z) → Magnitude of Intervention; Type of Intervention → Magnitude of Intervention"
