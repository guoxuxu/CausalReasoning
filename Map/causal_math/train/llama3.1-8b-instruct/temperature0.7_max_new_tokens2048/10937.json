  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a square matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another square matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T still strictly be a solution of the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation introduces an integral accumulation effect, altering the initial growth rate and properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Due to this integral effect and the continuous interaction between \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), the resultant function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not strictly adhere to the original dynamic equation \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
