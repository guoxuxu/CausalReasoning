  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the state at T?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of different integral transformations and matrix exponential factors on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can produce similar or even identical endpoints under varying interventions and initial conditions. Thus, it's impractical to conclusively determine the exact transformations applied merely based on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional contextual data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
