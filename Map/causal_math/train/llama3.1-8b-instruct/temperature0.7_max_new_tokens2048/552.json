  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant and determine how this affects the evolution of the function over time.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately discern whether transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both were applied, solely based on the observed output at T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining precisely which transformations were applied from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is not feasible. The same endpoint could result from varying parameters and transformations, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack the interventions without additional information on \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\), or the sequence of application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
