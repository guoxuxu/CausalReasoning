  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\) applied on a function F(s), and its subsequent inverse Laplace transformation to retrieve g(t). Analyze the influence of a linear differential operator \\( D \\), where \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\) (a is a constant), on the transformed function and its retrieval.\n\nGiven the function \\( h(t) \\) at t = T, can we precisely deduce which interventions were applied (either \\( D \\), \\( E \\), or both), solely based on \\( h(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The possibility of similar transformations by \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) leading to equivalent changes in \\( h(t) \\) without additional context or constraints (like specific values of a, b, initial conditions) makes it difficult to uniquely identify the applied interventions. The altered trajectories overlap in the Laplace domain, complicating attribution to specific operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
