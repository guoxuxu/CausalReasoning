  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the system's change under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition by multiplying it with \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which results in a different trajectory for the system. This change due to \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) distinctly affects the evolution, leading to a final state at t = T that differs from the original untransformed path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
