  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nSuppose a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) results in a compounded transformation of the initial state. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depends on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\), reflecting the cumulative effect of these transformations on both the magnitude and phase of the vector.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
