  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the eigenvalues of the final transformed matrix after applying both \\\\( T(A) \\\\) and \\\\( S(A) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the transformations used (e.g., the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the eigenvalues alone does not provide information about the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) used in the transformations, because many different matrices can be used to achieve the same eigenvalue-preserving similarity transformation. The specific form of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined solely from the eigenvalues of the output matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
