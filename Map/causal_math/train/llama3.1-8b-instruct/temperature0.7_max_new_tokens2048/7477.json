  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) satisfy the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The additional term \\\\( ax \\\\) does not satisfy the original differential equation, \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 ax}{dx^2} + k^2 ax = k^2 ax\\\\), which is non-zero unless \\\\(a = 0\\\\). This means the new function \\\\(v(x)\\\\) will not satisfy the original equation, altering the system's behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
