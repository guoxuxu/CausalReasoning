  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution at time T, \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), be different from the scenario where no source term was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) adds energy to the system and alters its initial and boundary conditions. The additional term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) in the heat equation introduces a new component to the temperature distribution throughout the evolution, making \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) fundamentally different from the case without \\\\( S(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
