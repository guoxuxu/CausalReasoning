  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We evaluate the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention is made such that the path of \\\\( w \\\\) is altered to avoid the origin midway through the transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depend only on the new segment of the path and not the sections before the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depends on the entire path of \\\\( w \\\\) due to the continuous nature of the integral and the transformation's dependency on all parts of the path before and after the intervention. Any segments circumventing the origin still affect the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
