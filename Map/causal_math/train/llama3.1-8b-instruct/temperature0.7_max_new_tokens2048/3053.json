  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transition rates are scaled by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) initially at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the original Markov process without further intervention, will the probability of being in state 2 at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if no scaling was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the transition rates by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) modifies the rates \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\lambda e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\), respectively. This alteration changes the dynamics of the Markov chain, affecting the state probabilities at any future time \\\\(t = T\\\\) different from the unmodified system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
