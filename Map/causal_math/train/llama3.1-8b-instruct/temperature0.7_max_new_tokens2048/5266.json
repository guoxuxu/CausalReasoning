  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if any transformations or interventions were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and retains all necessary information about the function, the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) can be reconstructed from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) irrespective of how the solution was evolved, provided no additional transformations are applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
