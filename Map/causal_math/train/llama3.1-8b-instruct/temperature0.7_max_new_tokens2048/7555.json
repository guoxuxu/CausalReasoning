  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) describes a complex-valued signal, and the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is used to analyze the system's frequency domain properties. The signal is transformed using a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nIf an intervention is performed at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) in which another modulation \\\\(g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a different constant frequency, will the final signal at time T depend only on the last intervention and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final signal at time T is influenced by both modulations, first by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and later by \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). The resulting signal includes effects from both frequencies in terms of overall modulation depth and phase shifting, which coalesce to form the new signal characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
