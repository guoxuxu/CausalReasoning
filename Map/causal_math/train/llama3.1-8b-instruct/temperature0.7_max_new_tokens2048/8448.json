  "Problem": "Consider the operation of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where the function describes a physical or mathematical system. We explore how changes in function through multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\) impacts the system.\n\nKnowing the final transformed state after multiple interventions involving multiplications by complex exponentials, can we distinctly identify the sequence or exact nature of those exponentials?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of successive transformations by different exponentials (such as shifting, scaling) can create a final transform state that is consistent with multiple possible sequences of applied exponentials. This ambiguity in transformation precludes definitive back-tracing of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Multiplication by e^{st} → Change in f(t); s → Change in e^{st}; Change in e^{st} → Change in f(t); t → Change in f(t)"
