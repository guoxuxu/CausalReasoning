  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) after applying a differential operation \\\\( D[T[z]](t) \\\\) at t = T/2, can we accurately determine the original unperturbed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differential intervention introduces complexities that can obscure or alter the characteristics of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The differentiated integrated data does not unambiguously reflect the original function's precise form, particularly its frequency and phase, through the changes imposed by operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
