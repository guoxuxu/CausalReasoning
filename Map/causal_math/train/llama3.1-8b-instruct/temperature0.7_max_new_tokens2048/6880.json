  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant matrix, over the time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively determine which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied by only knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations involving \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and the direct evolution under \\\\( D \\\\). The non-commutative nature and potential overlap in effects from the complex exponential transformations of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) contribute to multiple plausible pathways leading to the same final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), precluding a unique determination of prior interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
