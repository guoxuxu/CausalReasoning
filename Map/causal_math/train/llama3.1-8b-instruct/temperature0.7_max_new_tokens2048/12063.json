  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) and A is a matrix. We analyze the causal effect of a matrix intervention \\\\( B \\\\) on function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) and its corresponding transformed function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) post-intervention at a time T, can we determine exactly which matrices (A, B, or C) influenced the final result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed result \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) arises from the compounded effect of the matrices involved either initially or as interventions, which often can't be decomposed back into individual contributors due to the nature of exponential matrix operations and their overlap in effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
