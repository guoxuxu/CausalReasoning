  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), showing simple harmonic motion in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. Let's investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\) applied to z(t).\n\nKnowing the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at a certain endpoint T, can it be determined if the damping intervention was applied, assuming \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the initial settings or the dynamic parameters such as \\\\( \\omega \\\\), it's not feasible to ascertain whether the damping was specifically applied or if changes in the integral outcome were influenced solely by other factors like frequency shifts or system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
