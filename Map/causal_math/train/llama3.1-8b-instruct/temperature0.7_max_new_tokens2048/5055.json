  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping described by \\\\(w(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1\\\\) in the complex plane, and assess the impact of an integral transformation on this function given as \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int e^{-st} w(t) \\\\, dt \\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf an integral transformation \\\\( F(w) \\\\) is applied during the evolution, will the system's state at time \\\\(T\\\\) depend solely on the initial complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\) without regard to the transformation used?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( F(w) \\\\) introduces a significant external factor which modifies the evolution pathway. The output at time \\\\(T\\\\) is a consequence of both the inherent properties of \\\\(w(z)\\\\) and the effects introduced by the transformation \\\\( F(w) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
