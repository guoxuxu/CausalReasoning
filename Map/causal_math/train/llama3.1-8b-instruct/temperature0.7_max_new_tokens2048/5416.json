  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a vector space involving a matrix \\\\( P \\\\) representing a projection operator onto a subspace. Let us explore the changes in vectors under the operations defined by another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is an orthogonal matrix representing a rotation.\n\nGiven the final state of a vector \\\\( w \\\\) after known transformations by \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) and an unknown intervention, can we determine the nature of the intervention, specifically if it was a rotation or another type of linear transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( w \\\\) does not contain sufficient information to decipher the nature of intervention unless specific characteristics of the transformation (like eigenvalues or invariants preserved) are known, which typically are not discernible from the end state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
