  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nBased on the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\), can we precisely infer the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform produces a signature that is characteristic and unique to the frequency of the original function. Specifically, it forms a Dirac delta at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), allowing us to exactly deduce \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
