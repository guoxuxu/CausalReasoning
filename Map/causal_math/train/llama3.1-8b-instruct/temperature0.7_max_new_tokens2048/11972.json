  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant matrix, and z a complex variable. We explore how the function transforms under the action of a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{C} e^{Bw}f(w) dw \\\\), where B is another complex constant matrix and C is a closed contour in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is defined at some initial complex point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evaluated at another point \\\\( z = z_1 \\\\) under its own dynamics, will it reflect solely the effects of the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) inherently includes only the dynamics of the matrix A as it maps the complex variable z. There's no intervention or external modification from matrix B involved, hence it will solely reflect the effects of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
