  "Problem": "Consider a linear operation in a vector space described by the integral transform \\\\( H(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(t) x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a transformation function. We study the effect of applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined by \\\\( D[x(t)] = \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), an intervention applies another differential operator \\\\( E[x(t)] = \\\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\), will \\\\( H(D[x(t)]) \\\\) at any given time be independent of \\\\( E \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a second differential operator \\\\( E \\\\) introduces additional changes to the function, particularly affecting its curvature. This modification significantly alters the input to \\\\( H \\\\), thus impacting the final transformed outcome \\\\( H(D[x(t)]) \\\\). This output depends on both the initial differentiator \\\\( D \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( E \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
