  "Problem": "Imagine a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the application of a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex constant, to investigate integral transformations and their effects.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) of the complex function at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without any information on the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, any attempt to backtrack from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can lead to multiple possible initial conditions due to the potential modification from \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\). The lack of information about \\\\( Q \\\\) makes it impossible to accurately reverse the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
