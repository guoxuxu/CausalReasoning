  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{Ut}z(t) dt \\\\) (where U is a constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the ultimate function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on matrix M and not on matrices S or U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the evolution, making the final function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also influenced by both S in the initial transformation and U in the intervention. These transformations will alter the nature and the trajectory of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
