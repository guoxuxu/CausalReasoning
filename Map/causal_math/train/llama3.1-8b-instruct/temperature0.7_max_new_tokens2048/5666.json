  "Problem": "Consider a continuous dynamical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. The transformation is defined by \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( U(s) \\\\) without knowing whether it was altered by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the multiplication by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), we cannot precisely recover the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The transformation could either be \\\\( U(s) \\\\) or \\\\( U(s-a) \\\\), and without additional information, both are plausible depending on whether the alteration occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
