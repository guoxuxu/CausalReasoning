  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing system where a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) according to the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\). \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then analyzed at various time points t using a Fourier transform.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a high-pass filter is applied as an intervention, will the resultant spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) for times \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be independent of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a high-pass filter modifies the frequency components of the signal, but the overall spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) still depends on the initial modulation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) because the convolution effects are still embedded in the signal prior to the filtering. Thus, the resultant spectrum remains dependent on both the original modulation by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
