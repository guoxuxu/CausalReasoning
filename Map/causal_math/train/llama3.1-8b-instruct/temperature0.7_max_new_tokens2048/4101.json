  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix and z a complex variable. We examine how the integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw\\\\) influences behavior over the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is computed for a specific complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), then this value is used as an initial condition in another function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + g(z) \\\\), will \\\\( h(z) \\\\)'s behavior be purely determined by the properties of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is influenced not only by the squared term but significantly by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which integrates the exponential function driven by matrix A. The exponential component brings additional complexity that is not captured by the square function alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
