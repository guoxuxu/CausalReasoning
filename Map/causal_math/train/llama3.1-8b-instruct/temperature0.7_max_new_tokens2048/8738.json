  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), with constants a and b. We investigate how transformations like \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) affect this system, where C is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the exponential transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) was applied, reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is ambiguous. The transformation could alter both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), making it impossible to determine the original state without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
