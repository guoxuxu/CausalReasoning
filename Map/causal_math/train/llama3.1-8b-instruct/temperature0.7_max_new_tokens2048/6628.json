  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, representing the real and imaginary parts of the exponent, respectively. We examine the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on this function and how alterations to parameters impact the system dynamics.\n\nGiven the complex spectrum at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) after applying first a Laplace and then a Fourier transform on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we deduce both the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) and the nature of the individual transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "It is challenging to reverse-engineer exactly the original function and differential transformations from the output spectrum because many combinations of initial functions and transformations can yield similar frequency domain characteristics. The inversion problem is typically ill-posed without extra constraints or information, leading to multiple valid solutions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
