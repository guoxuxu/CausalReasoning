  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\), and A is a complex number. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( Tz = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) significantly influences the initial and evolving states of the system. Without knowing whether this transformation was applied, several different scenarios might lead to the same observed output at t = T, especially because the transformation integrates the evolving function \\\\( z(\\\\tau) \\\\) under an exponential influenced by B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
