  "Problem": "Consider the linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\) over time t, where L is another linear operator and S is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven the terminal state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the specific interventions (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) be identified precisely only by knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions with varying parameters L, D, S, and Q can lead to the same final state due to the overlapping influences of matrix exponentials and transformations. Therefore, it is impossible to uniquely deduce from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) the specific series or types of interventions conducted during the evolution process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
