  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nIf \\( g(x) \\) is applied to a vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\) without further intervention, will \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(x) \\) to \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 alters the initial condition to \\( x_0' = Q^{-1}x_0 \\). The system evolves from \\( x_0' \\) under \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), and due to this changed initial condition, \\( x(t) \\) at t = T will generally not match the state had \\( x_0 \\) been evolved with no transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
