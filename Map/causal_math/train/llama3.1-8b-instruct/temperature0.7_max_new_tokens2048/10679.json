  "Problem": "Consider the diffusion equation for heat transfer in a rod, \\\\( \\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = k \\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial x^2 \\\\), where u is the temperature, x is the spatial variable, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effect of an initial function \\\\( u(x,0) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is also a constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time t1, modifying the thermal diffusivity k to a new value k', will the future state \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) for t > t1 be solely affected by the initial parameter a?",
  "Explanation": "The change in thermal diffusivity from k to k' significantly influences the system's dynamics. Although a defines the initial condition, the alteration in thermal properties changes how heat diffuses through the rod, thus affecting the temperature distribution at any subsequent time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
