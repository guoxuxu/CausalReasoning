  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\\\), where K is a complex constant matrix. We investigate how the function affects solutions to the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\\\), where M is another complex constant matrix.\n\nSuppose an intervention function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz}w \\\\) (where C is a complex constant matrix) is applied at some z = Z_1, will the state \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) at Z > Z_1 depend solely on M and not on K or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\( z = Z_1 \\\\) by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) brings into play the exponential effects of another matrix C, and therefore, the final state \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) at any Z > Z_1 depends on initial K through application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), C in \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the matrix M. Their interplay affects the progression and final state in the differential equation rendering it dependent on K, C, as well as M.",
