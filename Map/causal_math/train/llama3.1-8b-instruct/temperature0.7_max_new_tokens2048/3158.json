  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact initial temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the deterministic nature of the heat equation, if there are no external interventions or disruptions, the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) can be uniquely backtracked by solving the inverse heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
