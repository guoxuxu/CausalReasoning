  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{i0} = 1 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value at time \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\) be the same as the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) transforms \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( f(z_0) = 1^2 = 1 \\\\). While the initial conditions remain the same, the square transformation could modify future states if applied differently; however, in this specific case where the initial condition and transformation align, the trajectories will coincidentally be the same because of the specific values of \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\). This is more happenstance than a rule, as altering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in any way generally changes the trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
