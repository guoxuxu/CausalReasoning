  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. This integral transformation is used to analyze the behavior of z(t) in the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies z(t) to \\\\( z_{new}(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) at a specific time t_2, where B is a different complex constant, will the transformed function \\\\( f(z_{new}) \\\\) still yield \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) when evaluated at s=B?",
  "Explanation": "The new function \\\\( z_{new}(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) leads to a new Laplace transform, \\\\( f(z_{new}) = \\\\frac{1}{s-B} \\\\). Evaluating this at s = B similarly results in an undefined outcome due to the singularity, but importantly the functional form itself diverges from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) indicating a change caused by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
