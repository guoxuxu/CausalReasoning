  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving under a system driven by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Nv \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At} w(t) dt \\\\) with a constant matrix A is applied to study the dynamics.\n\nIf the initial state of \\\\( z(0) = u(0) + iv(0) \\\\) is given, and systems evolve under their respective differential equations without further modification, will the calculated value of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at T be different if the systems evolved with a different initial condition such as \\\\( z(0) = v(0) - iu(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of initial conditions affects the dynamics of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) separately. Since each evolves according to different matrices M and N and contributes to the real and imaginary parts respectively, the integral transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\) will yield different results based on the specified initial conditions and the distinguishing characteristics of M and N matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
