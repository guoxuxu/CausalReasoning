  "Problem": "We are given a complex system where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) modifies a vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a vector space over the complex numbers. The angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is constant, and the system evolves according to the operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x = -i\\omega x \\\\). We analyze the behavior of the system with and without interventions involving a transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T evolve to the same state as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this case, applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x \\\\) simply results in the phase rotation of the vector, which is consistent over time. Since the evolution operator \\\\( \\mathcal{L}x \\\\) corresponds exactly to the transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\), the trajectory of the state remains unaltered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
