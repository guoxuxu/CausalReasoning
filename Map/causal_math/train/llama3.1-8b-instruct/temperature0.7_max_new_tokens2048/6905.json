  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nIf the trajectory of the particle \\\\( z(t) \\\\) follows a specific function without any intervention, will the spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of the movement remain consistent over the time if the same motion repeats in a periodic manner?",
  "Explanation": "Since the particle follows a periodic function, the Fourier transform, which breaks down the function into its frequency components, will consistently yield the same spectrum, reflecting the frequencies inherent in the periodic motion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
