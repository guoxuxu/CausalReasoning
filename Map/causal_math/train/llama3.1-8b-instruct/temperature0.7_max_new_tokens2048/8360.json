  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the function u, denoted as \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))(s)\\\\), on the behavior of the system over time t.\n\nGiven the final state in the frequency domain, \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether initial Fourier, intermediate Laplace, or none) solely based on this final representation?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in transformations and their effects make it infeasible to uniquely identify the sequence of applications. The transformations can potentially mask or mimic each other’s effects in the process, creating ambiguity in tracing back the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "initial state of u → u; u → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → tilde{u}(s,t); tilde{u}(s,t) → time evolution; time evolution → tilde{u}(s,T); transformations applied → tilde{u}(s,T); tilde{u}(s,T) → transformations applied"
