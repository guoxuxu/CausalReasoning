  "Problem": "Consider an integral transform scenario where \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} x(s) ds \\\\) and A is a constant matrix. The function \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and y is a constant vector, is applied to the system, and we are interested in understanding its effects at time T.\n\nDoes the initial application of \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\) determine the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) entirely, assuming no changes are made to the matrices A and B after initial set-up?",
  "Explanation": "The initial setup with \\\\( x(s) = e^{Bs}y \\\\) fully determines the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through the integral transform, where dependencies are explicitly set by B influencing the evolution of x over time and thus directly impacting the output through A. There is a deterministic path from setup to output in this linear time-invariant system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
