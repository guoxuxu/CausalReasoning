  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider transformations of the form \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z + \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the endpoint value \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity arising from the additive and multiplicative nature of the transformations applied (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)), combined with their influence on the system's trajectory, means that multiple intervention combinations could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This makes it difficult to uniquely pinpoint which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
