  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without altering \\\\( \\omega \\\\), will the primary frequency component of the transform at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a complex exponential function like \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) naturally highlights its frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), showing a Dirac delta function at this frequency. Without changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or additional interventions, this characteristic is preserved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
