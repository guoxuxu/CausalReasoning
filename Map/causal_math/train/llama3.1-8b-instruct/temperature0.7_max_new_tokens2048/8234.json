  "Problem": "Consider a complex system whose evolution is governed by a non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = N(z)\\\\), where \\\\(N(z)\\\\) denotes a non-linear operator involving complex functions. We study the effect of a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which translates the function from the time domain to the complex frequency domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at the initial time from the Laplace transformed state \\\\( z(s) \\\\) without knowing whether it evolved under \\\\( N(z) \\\\) or not?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the evolution implicates non-linear transformations, the Laplace transform \\\\( z(s) \\\\) itself might have been influenced in multiple, non-deterministic ways by the non-linear operator \\\\( N(z) \\\\). Without knowing the specific effects of \\\\( N \\\\) during the interval, it becomes infeasible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
