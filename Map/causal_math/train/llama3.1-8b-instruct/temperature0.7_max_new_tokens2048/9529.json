  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the function without further intervention, will the result at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M(t) \\\\) changes the initial phase of the function, effectively spinning it by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\). Hence, the angle \\\\(\\\\theta(T)\\\\) becomes \\\\(\\\\theta(0) + \\\\omega T\\\\), which is not equal to \\\\(\\\\theta(T)\\\\) if directly evolved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
