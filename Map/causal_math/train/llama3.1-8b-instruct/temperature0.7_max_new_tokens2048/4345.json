  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a fixed frequency. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\) is examined over this function, both with and without additional transformations.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time without any transformation and then undergoes the integral transformation \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), would the result be affected merely by the passage of time (i.e., changes in \\\\(t\\\\) independent from \\\\(s\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\(T[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} dt\\\\) results in \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\\\), which is independent of the untransformed progression of time. Therefore, time itself does not affect the result of the transformation, as it is inherently accounted for in the integrand's structure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
