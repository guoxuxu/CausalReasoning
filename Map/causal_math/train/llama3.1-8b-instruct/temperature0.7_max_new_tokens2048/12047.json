  "Problem": "Let \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represent a complex function governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Consider the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then exploring the causal relationships between different transformations applied to \\\\( z \\\\) at various times.\n\nFrom the observed Laplace transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine whether the intervention (exponential damping) was applied, distinguishable from the untreated trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "The character of the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), notably its poles and zeros, will distinctively shift due to the damping factor, marking a clear divergence from the trajectory without damping. This difference can be precisely identified through analysis of the transform, enabling the detection of the damping intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
