  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a square matrix. We explore the system's response under the integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where N is another constant matrix and t is a parameter for duration.\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing the result of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, presuming \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied, without knowing explicitly about the influence of N?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integration involving \\\\( e^{Ns} \\\\), multiple initial conditions can map to the same or similar states at time T due to the cumulative effect of past states modulated by N. The lack of precise knowledge about N renders it impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
