  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) where \\( t \\) is time and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. Using an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform, we wish to analyze how modifications to the original function impact its behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we determine \\( z(0) \\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) at \\( s=i \\) directly gives \\( z(0) \\) due to the properties of the transform of exponential functions. The calculated initial value \\( z(0) = 1 \\) can be correctly inferred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
