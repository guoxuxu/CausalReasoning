  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the response of the system to an input transformation \\\\(h(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{Dt}\\\\) over time t, where D is a constant operator.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(k(u) = u \\\\cdot e^{Et}\\\\) (where E is another constant operator) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on L and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\(k(u)\\\\) adds further modification to the state evolution, hence the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) will be influenced by L, D, as well as E. The transformations introduce overlapping effects that are not separated by merely relying on the linear operator L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
