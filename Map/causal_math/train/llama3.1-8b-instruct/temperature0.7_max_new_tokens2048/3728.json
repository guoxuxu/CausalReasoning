  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nAfter observing the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at a particular s = S, can we determine precisely which operations or scaling were applied to \\\\( V(s) \\\\), solely based on the outcome \\\\( I(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of linear systems and potential overlaps in the effects of different operations (like scaling or network operations), the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) can result from various combinations of interventions on \\\\( V(s) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of these interventions, it's impossible to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied based on the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
