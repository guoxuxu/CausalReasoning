  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform applied to a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\), and let the transformed function be \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\). Assume the operation of convolution with another function \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the time domain, consequently leading to a multiplication by \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), in the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(g(x)\\\\) and then Fourier transformed, will \\\\(F(\\\\omega)G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the product of their individual transforms, be the exact result of the Fourier transform on the convolved function?",
  "Explanation": "By the convolution theorem, convolving two functions in the time domain equals multiplying their Fourier transforms in the frequency domain. Thus, \\\\(F(\\\\omega)G(\\\\omega)\\\\) will indeed be the Fourier transform of \\\\(f(x) * g(x)\\\\), where '*' denotes convolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
