  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex constant, is considered.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\), introducing a complex exponential growth factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) that distorts both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over time. This leads to a divergent state trajectory considering the independent evolution paths defined by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
