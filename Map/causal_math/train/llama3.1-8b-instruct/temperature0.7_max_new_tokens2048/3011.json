  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a new value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), and the Laplace transform is recalculated, will the new transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) depend exclusively on the new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) and disregard the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Any changes to the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) directly affect the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), hence the transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) will reflect the state based on the new \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\). The original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) no longer influences the transformed function once it's changed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
