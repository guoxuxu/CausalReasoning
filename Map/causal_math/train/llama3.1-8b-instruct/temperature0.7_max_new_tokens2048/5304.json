  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), or different times of applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\), could lead to similar or indistinguishable outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\) due to the overlap in potential trajectories and the linear nature of the heat equation. This makes it impossible to uniquely backtrack and determine the specifics of the interventions used, highlighting the complexity and the non-uniqueness of the results in nonlinear transformations applied to PDE systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
