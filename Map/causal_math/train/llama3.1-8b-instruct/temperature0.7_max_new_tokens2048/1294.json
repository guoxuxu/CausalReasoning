  "Problem": "Given a linear operator L operating on a space of functions, consider how the Fourier transform interacts with differential operators. Let L be defined specifically for a function u(x) such that Lu = -u''(x) where ' denotes the derivative with respect to x.\n\nGiven the function \\( v(t) \\) at t = T, can we deduce precisely what the original function u(x) was at t = 0 without knowing if the Fourier transform was used?",
  "Explanation": "Even if it is known that L has operated on \\( u(x) \\), without confirmation if a Fourier transform or some other transformation was applied, reversing to the exact state of \\( u(x) \\) at t = 0 is highly uncertain. The changes induced by L and potential lack of information about initial Fourier transform application introduce significant ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
