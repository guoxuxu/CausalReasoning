  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) with A being a positive constant, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We explore the scenario where a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is applied, with B a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) for both real and imaginary parts without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) alters the initial complex number through a transformation dependent on B and t. Hence both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve differently from simply applying \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}u = -Au \\\\) directly to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
