  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nCan we explicitly determine which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both) to reach \\\\(z(T)\\\\) just from the knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specifics of interventions from the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone is complicated due to the cumulative effects of exponential scalings and phase modifications introduced by potential multiple transformations. The resulting state could be achieved through several combinations of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) values, making it impossible to definitively ascertain the interventions and their sequences precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
