  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\), where \\\\( f(t) \\) is the original function in the time domain and \\\\( F(s) \\) its image in the complex domain. An intervention is represented by the multiplication of \\\\( F(s) \\) with a complex exponential \\\\( e^{as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf the image \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( F(s) \\cdot e^{as} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the resulting fabric of the function at any later time \\\\( T > t_0 \\\\) remain identical as if unmodified?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{as} \\\\) shifts the original function in the time domain (specifically, translating it by \\\\( -a \\\\)). This intervention changes the original timeline of the function, hence the resulting function at any time \\\\( T \\\\) is altered, not matching the unmodified scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "modification of F(s) → change in f(t); e^{as} → change in F(s); modification of F(s) → change in F(s); t_0 → modification of F(s); modification of F(s) → f(t); T > t_0 → observation of f(t)"
