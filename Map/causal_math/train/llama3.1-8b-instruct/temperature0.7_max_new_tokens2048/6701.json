  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention under the system defined by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), will the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and thus changes the trajectory of each. As the transformations involve complex exponentials, they affect the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
