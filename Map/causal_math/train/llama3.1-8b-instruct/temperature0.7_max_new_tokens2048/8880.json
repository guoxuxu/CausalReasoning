  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{B(x-s)}u(s)ds \\) on the solution \\( u(x,t) \\), where B is another constant coefficient.\n\nGiven the state \\( u(x,T) \\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\( T(u) \\), \\( S(u) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( u(x,T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( u(x,T) \\) could result from various combinations and sequences of the transformations \\( T(u) \\) and \\( S(u) \\), particularly since both transformations involve convolutions that can overlap in effect. This overlap makes it challenging to pinpoint uniquely which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
