  "Problem": "Consider two complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\) where \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\). The scenario examines the relationship between these functions under different operations and transformations such as differentiation and integration in the complex plane.\n\nIf we differentiate \\\\(z(t)\\\\) with respect to time t, and do the same for \\\\(w(t)\\\\) without any intervention, does the derivative of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) affect the derivative of \\\\(w(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation of \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) results in \\\\(iz(t)\\\\), which is a purely imaginary value dependent only on t. This operation has no effect on the differentiation of \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\), which yields \\\\(1/t\\\\), a separate and independent result from the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
