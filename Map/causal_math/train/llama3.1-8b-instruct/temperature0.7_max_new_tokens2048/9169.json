  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T = t under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the complex vector's trajectory by scaling it exponentially, impacting both real and imaginary parts via matrix C. This alteration will generally result in different terminal values for \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and \\\\( y(T) \\\\) than would be the case without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
