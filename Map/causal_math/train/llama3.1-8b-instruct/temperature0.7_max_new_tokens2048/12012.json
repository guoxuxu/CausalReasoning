  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function f(z) in the complex plane, where \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) and k is a real constant. We explore the implications of modifying this function via a linear transformation \\( T(z) = az + b \\) where a and b are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane and then followed by the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting function at a point \\\\( z \\\\) be the same as directly applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) first and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The order of applying these transformations matters due to the non-commutative nature of function composition in complex functions. Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) first and then \\\\( T(z) \\\\) results in \\\\( f(T(z)) = e^{k(az+b)} \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( T(f(z)) = a e^{kz} + b \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
