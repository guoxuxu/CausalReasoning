  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0 \\\\) in a bounded two-dimensional region with boundary conditions determined by \\\\( u(x, y) = g(x, y) \\\\) and the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x, y) u(x, y) dxdy \\\\).\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) after altering the function \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) and the domain, can we precisely determine the original domain and function configuration?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of the domain and \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) might result in the same output of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), due to the overlapping effects that changes in domain and \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) have on the integrated value. Without additional information, these factors are indeterminate from the final value of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
