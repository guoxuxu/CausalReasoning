  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) of the shifted function \\\\( w(x, y) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original unshifted function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) without knowing the shift vector \\\\( v \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the shift vector \\\\( v = (a, b) \\\\), the phase information alone from \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) cannot uniquely reconstruct the spatial displacement in the function, as multiple shift combinations can result in the same phase shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
