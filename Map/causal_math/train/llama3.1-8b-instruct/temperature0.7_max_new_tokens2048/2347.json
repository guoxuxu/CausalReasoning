  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse used in solving differential equations. Suppose \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and the differential equation given is \\\\( y'' + 3y' + 2y = f(t) \\\\) with initial conditions \\\\( y(0) = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( y'(0) = 0 \\\\).\n\nIf an external function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) is introduced at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and used to modify the system's dynamics, will the ultimate form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) still solely be governed by \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as an intervention changes the system's dynamics, leading to a different non-homogeneous term in the differential equation. The new total driving function becomes a combination of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\), changing the subsequent behavior and solution of \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
