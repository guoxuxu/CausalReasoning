  "Problem": "Consider a system where complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. To investigate the relationship, we introduce a transformation with the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we introduce another function \\\\( j(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (where \\\\( E \\\\) is a constant complex matrix) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be unaffected by matrices \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\) and depend only on \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( j(z) \\\\) during the progression introduces an additional complex plane transformation that alters the trajectory and dependencies. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the influences not only from \\\\( C \\\\) but significantly from \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\) as well, each affecting the complex function evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
