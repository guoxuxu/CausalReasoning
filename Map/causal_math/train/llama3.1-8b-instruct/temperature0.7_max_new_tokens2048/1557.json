  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a complex function transformation on a real function g(x) over the domain [0, 1]. The transformation is defined by T(g)(x) = ∫_0^1 e^(iπsx) g(s) ds, where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf T is applied to a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\) at x = 0, and then the transformed function is analyzed without further intervention, will the value of the transformed function at x = 0.5 be the same as applying transformation directly at x = 0.5?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation T modifies the function g by integrating it against a complex exponential function across the entire domain. The result at any specific point x depends on the integral over the entire domain, meaning direct application at different values of x produces different results due to the varying complex exponential factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
