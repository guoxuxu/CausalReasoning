  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) \\\\) is introduced into the flow at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the Navier-Stokes equations governed by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature profile at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t = 0) \\\\) was evolved without the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) influences the advection and diffusion of the temperature field, altering the temperature profile over time compared to a scenario without flow, leading to differences in thermal dispersal and gradients.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
