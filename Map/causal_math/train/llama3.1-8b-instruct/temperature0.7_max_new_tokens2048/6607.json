  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{i\\\\omega't} \\\\) at some t = t_1, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), say \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), be just a simple sum of the individual transforms of the original and added components for all s?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the Laplace transform ensures that \\\\( Z'(s) = L\\\\{z(t) + e^{i\\\\omega't}\\\\} = L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} + L\\\\{e^{i\\\\omega't}\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} + \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\), demonstrating that \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) is indeed the sum of the individual transforms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
