  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of \\\\(v(x)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\(v(x)\\\\), \\\\(w(x)\\\\), or both) only by observing the Fourier transform results?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of linear combinations of functions, such as those with added linear or quadratic terms, can result in similar spectral features that are difficult to parse out distinctly. Hence, the specific forms of \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\) and their presence in the final observed transform cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
