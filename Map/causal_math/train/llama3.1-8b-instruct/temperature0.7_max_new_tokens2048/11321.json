  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) inside a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + g(x) \\\\) is applied globally within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is a known function, analyze the various causal influences.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the function u at t = 0 creating an initial condition \\\\( u_0 = u + g(x) \\\\), and the system evolves accordance with the boundary conditions unchanged, will the solution inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) at any future time t be different due to the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding \\\\( g(x) \\\\), which satisfies \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 g = 0\\\\) everywhere, it doesn't alter the harmonicity of \\\\(u\\\\) but shifts the values across \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). This change effectively alters the solution over the domain, so at any future time t, the behavior of the u field inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) will reflect the transformed initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
