  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing physical quantities in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the precise initial output \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without intervention and without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear information on whether the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied initially, it's impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) can significantly alter the initial characteristics and evolution of the LTI system, obscuring the ability to infer \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
