  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nBased on the transformed integral result, can we uniquely determine the sequential operations used (whether \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Bz}w(z) \\\\), or both) during the integration, by knowing only the end result of \\\\( I(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral result in \\\\( I(w) \\\\) could be achieved through various sequences or combinations of operations involving \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bz} \\\\), especially without explicit knowledge of the integration path and the initial or intermediate function forms. The overlaps and potential compensations in effects due to different constants make it impossible to conclusively determine the operations involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
