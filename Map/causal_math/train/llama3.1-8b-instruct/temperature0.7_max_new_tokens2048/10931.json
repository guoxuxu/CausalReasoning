  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on C or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the ongoing trajectory based on both previous and current transformations, causing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to be dependent on D, C, and F. The combined effects of these variables influence the ultimate state and cannot be ignored.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
