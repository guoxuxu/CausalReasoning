  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as the complex integral transform of a real function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number with a real part that ensures convergence. The causal relationship between function modifications and their effect on the integral transform output is explored.\n\nIf the real function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered by adding a constant function, say \\\\( x(t) + c \\\\), and then transformed without any other intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) differ from the original scenario without the addition?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a constant \\\\( c \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) introduces a new component to the integral, specifically \\\\( \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} c dt \\\\), which modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This transformation is not merely scaling but adds a distinct term dependent on \\\\( s \\\\), thus altering \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
