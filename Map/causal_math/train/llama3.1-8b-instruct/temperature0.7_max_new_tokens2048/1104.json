  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nGiven only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain which transformations or operations were applied, whether it was \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both, during the system evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied solely from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is impractical without additional data. Since the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) can create overlapping effects and dependencies among \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\), it is challenging to isolate and identify the specific influences of each operation merely based on endpoint observations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
