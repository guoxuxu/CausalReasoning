  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) is applied to the time series after it has been Fourier transformed and before applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the result \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and not on the nonlinear operation?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) introduces a nonlinearity that affects the spectrum of the signal, distorting \\\\( X(s) \\\\) before it is filtered by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This results in a \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) that depends significantly on the nonlinear operation as well as the original signal and its filtering, modifying the final spectral components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
