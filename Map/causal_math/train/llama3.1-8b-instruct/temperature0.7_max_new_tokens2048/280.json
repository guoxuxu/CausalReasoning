  "Problem": "Consider a mechanical system where the force \\( F \\) applied to an object causes it to accelerate according to Newton's second law \\( F = ma \\), where \\( m \\) is mass and \\( a \\) is acceleration. Suppose a particular transformation \\( h(a) = k \\cdot a \\) defines a modification to the acceleration, where \\( k \\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nGiven the final position \\( x(T) \\), can we determine exactly which interventions were used (whether \\( h(a) \\), changing mass to \\( m' \\), or both) by knowing only \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different combinations of the scaling factor \\( k \\), original mass \\( m \\), and modified mass \\( m' \\) may result in the same final position \\( x(T) \\). The interplay between these variables during the system evolution makes it impossible to pinpoint the exact interventions solely based on the final position.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying force F and modifying acceleration with a constant scaling factor k both contribute to the final position x(T), but changing mass to m' does not affect the final position."
