  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) after observing its transform \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) as a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transform being a Dirac delta function at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\) directly indicates that the only frequency component in \\\\( z(x) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\). This is due to the unique relationship in Fourier transforms where each frequency component corresponds distinctly to a delta function in the transform space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
