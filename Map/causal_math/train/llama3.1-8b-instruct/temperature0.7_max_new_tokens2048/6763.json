  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is produced by applying a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The output is then transformed by a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze how these transformations affect the relationship between input and output over time t.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), remains dependent on the system's initial impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) even after the intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) alters the mode of propagation but does not negate the effects of the impulse response, which fundamentally governs the relationship between the input and the initial output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
