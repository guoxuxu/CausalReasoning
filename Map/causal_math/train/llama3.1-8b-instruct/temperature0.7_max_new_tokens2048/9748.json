  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely deduce both the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and the subsequent intervention by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\), solely based on the value and form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from complex interplays of transformations and integral operations, which often cannot be separated or reversed uniquely. Multiple combinations of parameters and transformations can yield the same endpoint, leading to ambiguity in identifying the exact sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
