  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nGiven an observed output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at s = S, can we deduce the exact scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) applied to an unknown initial voltage \\\\( V_0(s) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial state \\\\( V_0(s) \\\\) or its characteristics, one cannot uniquely determine the scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) applied. Multiple combinations of \\\\( V_0(s) \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) could result in the same observed \\\\( I(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
