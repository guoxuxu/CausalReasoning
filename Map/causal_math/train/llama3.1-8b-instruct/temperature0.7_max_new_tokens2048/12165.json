  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, and the effect of a Fourier transform on functions within this space. Specifically, examine the case where \\\\( Lf = -if' \\\\), and the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( f \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\) of the function after applying operator L, can we recover \\\\( f \\\\) uniquely without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since knowing \\\\( \\\\hat{Lf}(k) \\\\) which is \\\\( -ik \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) gives us the transform of \\\\( f' \\\\) up to a constant factor, we can uniquely recover \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\) by dividing by \\\\( -ik \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\neq 0 \\\\)). When \\\\( k=0 \\\\), \\\\( f \\\\) can be reconstructed assuming initial conditions or further constraints if needed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
