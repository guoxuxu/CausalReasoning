  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, on a field defined by \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) over the complex plane. The function transforms the complex variable \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) over time, under linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex plane coordinate \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\) without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( w(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) modifies the initial condition in the complex plane, which subsequently changes how \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) evolves under the matrix transformation \\\\( T(v) \\\\). The initial alteration introduced by the complex exponential function can significantly affect the outcome, due to the nature of exponential and linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
