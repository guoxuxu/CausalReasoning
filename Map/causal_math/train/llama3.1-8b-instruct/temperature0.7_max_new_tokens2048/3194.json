  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving a circuit with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and two components: a resistor with resistance R and a capacitor with capacitance C. The input voltage across the circuit can be described by the function \\\\( u(t) = U_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and we are interested in analyzing the output voltage across the capacitor \\\\( v(t) \\\\) using the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the output voltage \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at frequency \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) without knowing the input frequency, can we accurately determine the original input frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple input frequencies could result in a similar output due to the properties of sinusoidal functions in the Laplace transform and the potential for identical magnitudes of the transforms at different frequencies. Without explicit knowledge of the input, the output alone is insufficient to determine \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
