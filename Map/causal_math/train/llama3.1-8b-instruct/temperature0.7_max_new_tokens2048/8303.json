  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a real number representing a rotational frequency in the complex plane. The behavior over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real number.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another real number) is introduced, will the final position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The rotation induced by \\\\( B \\\\) and the subsequent modification by \\\\( C \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) both influence the final position. Hence, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) is dependent on \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). Each transformation impacts the trajectory by altering the rotational dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
