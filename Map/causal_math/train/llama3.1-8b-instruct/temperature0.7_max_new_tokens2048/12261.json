  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) of the function at some instant, can we determine the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t=0 precisely without knowing whether the transformation was applied previously?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the Laplace transform was previously applied, and the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) used, we cannot uniquely determine the initial function since the transformation might have been initialized with a different complex frequency component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
