  "Problem": "Let \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(n\\\\) is a positive integer, define a transformation in the complex plane. Consider the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\lambda z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a complex constant with a non-zero real part, describing an exponential decay or growth depending on the sign of the real part of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\). We aim to analyze how applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) affects the solutions over time.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and the system \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\\\lambda z\\\\) takes over with no further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) differ from solving \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\\\lambda z\\\\) directly starting from \\\\(z_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the transformation \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\), the initial condition is modified from \\\\(z_0\\\\) to \\\\(z_0^n\\\\). Given the non-linearity of the exponential decay equation and the transformation, the trajectory and the final state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will be different from the direct application due to the multiplicative power raising.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
