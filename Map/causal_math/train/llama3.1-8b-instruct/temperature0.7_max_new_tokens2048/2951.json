  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane wherein a transformation \\\\( z \\\\to e^{kt} z \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where k is a complex constant. Analyze the transformation's effect on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) around a closed contour C.\n\nIf an intervention applies another transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\to f(e^{lt} z) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), where l is a different complex constant, will the final value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) remain dependent only on the initial k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with another transformation introduces a new modifying factor, changing the scale of dependency from the initial transformation parameter k to both k and l. The final integral value thus depends on the composition effects of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
