  "Problem": "Consider a complex function analysis where the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied to a function in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system's dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = kz \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced, as the phase shift introduced could correspond to multiple potential starting points depending on the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
