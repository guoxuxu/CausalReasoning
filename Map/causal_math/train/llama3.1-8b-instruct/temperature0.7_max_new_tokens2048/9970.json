  "Problem": "Evaluate the stability and causal inference of the system governed by the linear partial differential equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We consider the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\)\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\), is it possible to accurately determine the initial state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible, meaning that one can retrieve the original state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform, regardless of the initial application of the Fourier transform, assuming no loss of information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
