  "Problem": "Investigate a system characterized by the continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) of a signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), denoted as \\\\(X(f)\\\\). Explore how the multiplication by a complex exponential \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_0 t}\\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\(f_0\\\\) is a frequency offset, affects the transform.\n\nIf another modulation \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_1 t}\\\\) is applied as an intervention at a later time, will the ultimate frequency spectrum solely reflect a shift of \\\\(f_0 + f_1\\\\) from the original \\\\(X(f)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a second modulation by \\\\(e^{2\\\\pi i f_1 t}\\\\) cumulatively adds to the frequency shift introduced by the first modulation. The resultant spectrum would be reflective of the aggregate shift amounting to \\\\(f_0 + f_1\\\\), adhering to the linear superposition principle in the Fourier transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
