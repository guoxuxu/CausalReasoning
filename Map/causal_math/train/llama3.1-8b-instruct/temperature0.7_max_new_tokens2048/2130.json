  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t))(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the original time domain function. Investigate the effect of inverse Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(Y(s))(t) \\\\) and the influence of multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) in the s-domain on this relationship.\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) obtained from an unknown \\\\( y(t) \\\\) via the Laplace transform, can \\\\( y(t) \\\\) always be exactly recovered without prior knowledge of additional transformations like multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If no additional transformation like multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\) affects \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform can theoretically and uniquely recover \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) under proper conditions (assuming the transform pair is correctly known and there are no singularities affecting convergence).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform of y(t) → Y(s); Y(s) → inverse Laplace transformation of Y(s); Y(s) → multiplication by s; multiplication by s → shift in time domain"
