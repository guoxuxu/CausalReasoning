  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T strictly depend on the matrix A and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) introduces a counteracting phase shift, making the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) dependent not only on the matrix A but also on the original transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) and the intervention. The interaction of these complex exponentials affects the trajectory and final state of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
