  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nGiven the transformed system \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\) and its solution, can we determine the solution to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without explicitly knowing M?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of M, it is impossible to exactly ascertain what transformations were applied to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). Therefore, while the solution to the transformed equation is consistent with that of the original, without M, one cannot reconstruct the original conditions or verify the equivalence directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
