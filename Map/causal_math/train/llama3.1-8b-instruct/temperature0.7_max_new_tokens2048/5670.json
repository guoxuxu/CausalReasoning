  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a time-dependent state of the system. The impact of convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) expressed as \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( H(s) = L[h(t)] \\\\) at a time T, can we confidently reconstruct both \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without knowing beforehand that \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) was the convolution of two functions?",
  "Explanation": "The product form of \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain does not uniquely specify \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without additional information. Multiple function pairs can yield the same product, making it impossible to uniquely deduce the original functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) from \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
