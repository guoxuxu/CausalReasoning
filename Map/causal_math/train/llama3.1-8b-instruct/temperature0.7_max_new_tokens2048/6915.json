  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant and u is a function of both x and t. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), is applied to u resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), where k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nIf at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new operation \\\\(G\\\\) defined as \\\\(G\\\\hat{u} = i\\\\frac{d\\\\hat{u}}{dk}\\\\) is applied as an intervention within the transformed domain, will the resultant state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on the new operation G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the operation G alters the spectral components of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}\\\\) by introducing a derivative with respect to the wave number, affecting how the transformed state evolves from that point onward. The new state of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) now depends on both the original parameter A and the characteristics of G, implying a dependency beyond just A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
