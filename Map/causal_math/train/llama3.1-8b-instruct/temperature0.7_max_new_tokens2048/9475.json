  "Problem": "Consider a model described by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function. An external influence is introduced by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( j(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transformation parameter \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), the system's intrinsic parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), and the intervention parameter \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\). The compound effect of exponential scaling from both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) along with the rotational dynamics introduced by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) means the state at T is influenced by all parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
