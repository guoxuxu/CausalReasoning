  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The function is transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention introduces another factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reliant on D as well as A and B. The additional transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can fundamentally modify the trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), affecting both the magnitude and direction components of the complex state over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
