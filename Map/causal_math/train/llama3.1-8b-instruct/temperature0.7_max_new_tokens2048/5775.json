  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\), where A is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( k(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ct}z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a different constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new transformation function, \\\\( k(z) \\\\), contributes additional dynamics through \\\\( C \\\\). Hence, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the sequence and effects of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), along with the intrinsic evolution driven by \\\\( M \\\\). The various integral transformations interact in a way that makes their individual effects non-trivial to separate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
