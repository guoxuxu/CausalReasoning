  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Laplace transform on a continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) that is subjected to the operator \\\\( L[g(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. Analyze scenarios where an additional transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nIf an intervention of multiplying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) with \\\\( t^2 \\\\) (applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) is done at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) before taking \\\\( L[g(t)] \\\\), does the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) reflect only the original characteristics of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or the intervention as well?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is indeed different from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) because it integrates the effects of the intervening multiplication by \\\\( t^2 \\\\). This intervention changes the output significantly, as the transform of \\\\( t^2g(t) \\\\) rather than just \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is evaluated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
