  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the current I(t) depends on the applied voltage V(t) through the differential equation \\\\(L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. Analyze different scenarios when mathematical transformations are applied to the voltage by a function \\\\(g(V) = e^{st}V\\\\) representing a scaling of the voltage by an exponential function over time t, where s is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(g(V)\\\\) is applied to the initial voltage condition at t = 0, and then the system evolves according to the given differential equation without further intervention, will the current I(t) at time T be the same as if the initial voltage V(t) were applied directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(V)\\\\) to the voltage modifies the entire response of the system. The exponential scaling changes the effective voltage input, resulting in variations in current dynamics due to the nature of the coupled equations, affecting the charging rate of the capacitor and current evolution through the inductor and resistor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
