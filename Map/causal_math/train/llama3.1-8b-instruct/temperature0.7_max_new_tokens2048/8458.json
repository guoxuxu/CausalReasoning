  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane and a contour integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\), where \\( \\gamma \\) is a closed path in the complex domain. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) to the function before integrating.\n\nGiven the integral result \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(z(x)) \\, dx \\), can we determine \\( \\int_{\\gamma} z(x) \\, dx \\) without knowing \\( z(x) \\) or \\( \\gamma \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T \\) alters the original function \\( z \\) in such a way that getting the integral of \\( z \\) from the transformed integral result cannot uniquely determine the original integral due to potential changes in properties like residues and poles inside \\( \\gamma \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
