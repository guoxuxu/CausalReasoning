  "Problem": "Consider the impact of Laplace Transform on the solution of a differential equation. The original equation is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} + 3u = 0 \\\\), and we study the implications of solving this equation using the Laplace Transform. Furthermore, let's explore the scenario where the initial condition is modified by \\\\( u(0) = K \\\\) where K is a constant.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace Transform to solve the differential equation without altering the initial condition \\\\( u(0) = 0 \\\\), will the structure of the solution in the Laplace domain change?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform directly to the differential equation with an unaltered initial condition modifies the problem into the s-domain where the structure and properties might alter due to the transformation properties, despite having the initial conditions unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace Transform → Changing the equation domain; Initial condition u(0) = 0 → No change in the equation; Initial condition u(0) = K → Changing the initial condition; Modified equation → Solving the differential equation; Solving the differential equation → Obtaining the solution; Applying Laplace Transform → Changing the solution structure; Initial condition u(0) = K → Changing the solution structure"
