  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without any further changes, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved up to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) alters the original amplitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a factor of \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T} \\\\). This results in a different trajectory and endpoint because the amplitude growth introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) modifies how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from its initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
