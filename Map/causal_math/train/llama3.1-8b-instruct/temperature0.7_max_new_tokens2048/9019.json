  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An external operator applies a transformation \\\\( h(x) = Qx \\\\) at time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, and we analyze its impact over various conditions.\n\nSuppose a different transformation \\\\( k(x) = Rx \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend only on M and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The state at time T, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), depends on previous transformations and thus directly on Q and R as well as on M. Both transformations \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\) modify the trajectory through their application at different times, thereby influencing the eventual state reached at \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
