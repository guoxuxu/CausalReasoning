  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\), where w is a complex number. The transformation via Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to different function scenarios and the impact on causal inference is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final outcome of a Laplace transform, can we precisely identify whether the original function was \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) or the intervention of \\\\( t^2e^{iwt} \\\\) was applied, just by observing the transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed result contains information about the function in the Laplace domain, but similar results can be derived from different original or intervened functions due to the complexity and potential overlaps in features such as poles and residues in different scenarios. Specific determinations between original and modified functions are not guaranteed without additional discriminative data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
