  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional region. Suppose the velocity field is represented as \\\\( \\\\vec{u} = (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t)) \\\\) and governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. An external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} = (f_x(x,y,t), f_y(x,y,t)) \\\\) can be controlled as an intervention.\n\nIf an external force \\\\( \\\\vec{f} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) and continued until time \\\\( T \\\\), does the final velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x, y, T) \\\\) depend only on the applied force and not on the initial conditions or viscosity?",
  "Explanation": "While the external force will significantly influence the evolution and state of the velocity field at time \\\\( T \\\\), the outcome still depends on the initial conditions and the fluid properties such as viscosity, along with how these factors interact with the force applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
