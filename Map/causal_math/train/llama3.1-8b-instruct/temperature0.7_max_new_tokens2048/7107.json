  "Problem": "Examine the effects of a complex function transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\(t\\\\) is time. This scenario includes the subsequent application of Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) on a complex function \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(z'(t) = e^{-t}\\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(z'(t))\\\\}\\\\) solely reflect the properties of the new transformation ignoring the earlier \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The secondary transformation, \\\\(z'(t) = e^{-t}\\\\), shifts the function further, potentially affecting both convergence and the range of \\\\(f\\\\). The final behavior of the Laplace transform will be a result of both the original and the intervention transformations, combining effects from \\\\(e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{-t}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
