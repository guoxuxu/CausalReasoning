  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, and \\\\(f\\\\) is holomorphic. We transform this function using the Laplace transform on the real part and the Fourier transform on the imaginary part, denoted as \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Re(f(x, y))\\\\}(s) + i\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{Im(f(x, y))\\\\}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the original function \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) is analytically continued, will the transformed function \\\\(F(s, \\\\omega)\\\\) still represent the same complex function in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\) is holomorphic and the transforms applied are linear and respect the structure of complex functions, the transformation will conform to the new domain while preserving the integrity of the underlying function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Analytic continuation of f(x, y) → holomorphic property of f; holomorphic property of f → existence of Laplace transform; existence of Laplace transform → existence of F(s); existence of Fourier transform → existence of F(s); existence of F(s) → F(s, ω) represents the same complex function in the transformed domain"
