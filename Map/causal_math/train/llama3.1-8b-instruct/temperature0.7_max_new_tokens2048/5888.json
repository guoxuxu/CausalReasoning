  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Poisson equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = f\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\), with \\\\(f\\\\) representing a source term. This domain undergoes a transformation \\\\(T\\\\) that maps it to a new domain \\\\(D'\\\\). The transformation changes how the system responds over time.\n\nCan the original domain \\\\(D\\\\) and source term \\\\(f\\\\) configuration be accurately determined from the solution in the modified domain \\\\(D'\\\\) with an intervened source term, based only on observing the final state in \\\\(D'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state in the transformed domain \\\\(D'\\\\) with an additional source term results from complex interactions between domain alterations and source dynamics. These factors create a non-unique scenario where multiple configurations from the original setting could lead to similar outcomes in \\\\(D'\\\\), rendering precise backward inference impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
