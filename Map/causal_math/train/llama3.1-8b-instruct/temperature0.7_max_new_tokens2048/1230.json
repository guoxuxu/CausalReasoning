  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt} z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is also a constant matrix, is applied at a specific time interval.\n\nGiven the outcome of the transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can one uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the function was solely evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) incorporates the effects of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\), which blends with the effects of the original differential operator P. This integration masks the initial conditions uniquely provided by P's evolution alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
