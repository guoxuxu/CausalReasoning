  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by the function \\\\( q(z) = Tz \\\\) (where T is another constant, invertible matrix) is applied to the system, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be fundamentally unaffected by the earlier transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(z) \\\\) compounds with the effects of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the inherent stochasticity of the process. The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both the prior and the latest transformations, as well as the unpredictable influence of the Weiner process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
