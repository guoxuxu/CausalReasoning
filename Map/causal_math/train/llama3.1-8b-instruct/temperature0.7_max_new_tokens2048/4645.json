  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real scalar constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the changes in the function under different transformations and interventions, especially focusing on transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real scalar constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial state to \\\\( e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\). The trajectory of the system under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) starting from this modified initial condition leads to \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}(e^{iBT}z_0) \\\\), which exhibits a phase shift introduced by B, modifying the trajectory and end state compared to direct evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
