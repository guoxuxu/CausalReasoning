  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. This setup is used to analyze the interaction between the two exponential terms over time.\n\nGiven the information about \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it feasible to backtrack and accurately pinpoint whether the transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied, considering the combined dynamics of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data about system configurations or specific constraints on the dynamics, it's highly complex to deduce just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) whether the intervention \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied. The transformations due to \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), overlaps, and their exponential nature can result in equivalent effects for different initial conditions or intervention applications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The feasibility of backtracking and pinpointing the transformation g(u) depends on the values of the matrices A and B, as well as the combined dynamics of C."
