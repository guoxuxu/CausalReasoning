  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nGiven the output at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (either \\\\(f(z)\\\\) or \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or both) were applied during the evolution to time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlaid effects of the transformations \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) can result in similar or indistinguishable trajectories at time \\\\(T\\\\), making it impossible to definitively identify which transformations were applied based solely on the endpoint data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
