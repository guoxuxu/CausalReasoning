  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\alpha t} \\\\) could have scaled \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in various ways depending on its value, affecting the amplitude and phase of the trajectory. Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
