  "Problem": "Consider a set of complex functions defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state in the complex plane. We assess the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kz} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-kz} \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interaction of the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition and thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), through the non-trivial coupling of the exponential parameters. This means the endpoint will be affected by both \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
