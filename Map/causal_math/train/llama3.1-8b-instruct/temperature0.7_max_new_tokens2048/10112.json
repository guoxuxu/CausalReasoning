  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in a complex domain that undergoes a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to it, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Consider also actions of modifications using multiplier functions \\\\( m(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) and \\\\( n(s) = s^b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nKnowing only the modified transform \\\\( s^b F(s+a) \\\\) at a endpoint, can we ascertain both the original modifications via \\\\( m(x) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( n(s) \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of multipliers in both x-domain and s-domain make it difficult to separate out the individual impacts of \\\\( m(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) and \\\\( n(s) = s^b \\\\) only from the final form \\\\( s^b F(s+a) \\\\). Different combinations of a and b can produce similar results, leading to an inability to conclusively determine the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
