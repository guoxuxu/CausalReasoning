  "Problem": "Analyze a system modeled by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) the initial condition. We consider the impact of applying a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{Bt}x_1 \\\\), resulting in a new function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the convolution described by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied initially and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without further action, will the resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be identical to the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\) evolved without the convolution?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the convolution alters the initial condition and introduces new dynamics to the system, hence \\\\( f(t) \\\\) created by the convolution of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) will differ from the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The influence of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( x_1 \\\\) modifies the response and is not merely a time-shifted version of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
