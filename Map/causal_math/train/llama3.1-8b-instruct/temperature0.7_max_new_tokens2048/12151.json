  "Problem": "Investigate the effects of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, on a real variable system \\\\( x(t) = t^2 \\\\) under both normal evolution and perturbed conditions.\n\nGiven the observed outcome of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) following an intervention, can one discern whether the initial affecting function was \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the intervention function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), based solely on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because \\\\( x(t) \\\\) naturally evolves independently from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and is only influenced by real value changes like those introduced in \\\\( h(x) = x + \\cos(t) \\\\), the final value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not give any specific clues about the presence or role of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) versus the direct impact of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
