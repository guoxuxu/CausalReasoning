  "Problem": "Let's analyze a control system with state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) whose dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We observe the effect when transforming the state by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied, and given that \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( Q \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectories predictably, it's generally impossible to uniquely infer \\\\( x_0 \\\\) due to potential alterations caused by \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
