  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to the system, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = U(s) \\).\n\nGiven the transformed output \\( U(s) \\) at point \\( s = S \\), can it be determined precisely which operators (whether \\( L \\), \\( M \\), or both) were involved in shaping \\( u(t) \\) by solely analyzing \\( U(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-unique nature of the operators' effects and potential overlaps in how they can modify \\( u(t) \\), it is challenging to determine precisely from \\( U(s) \\) alone which operators were used. The transformed space can represent multiple potential scenarios in original domain dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
