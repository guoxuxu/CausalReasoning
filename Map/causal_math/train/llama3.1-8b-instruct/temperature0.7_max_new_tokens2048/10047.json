  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) in the complex plane, where A is a real constant and i represents the imaginary unit. The function describes rotation around the origin with angular velocity A. We explore different transformations involving the operator \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, and examine the trajectories and causality in this rotating system.\n\nSuppose an intervention changes the angular velocity to \\\\( iBt \\\\) at a time t_1, and \\\\( B \\\\neq A \\\\), would the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward purely reflect the new velocity rather than any influence from the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the angular velocity changes to \\\\( iBt \\\\), the impact of the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) influences the subsequent trajectory. The state not only rotates with a new velocity but from a position already altered by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making its evolution a combined effect of both the initial condition and the new velocity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
