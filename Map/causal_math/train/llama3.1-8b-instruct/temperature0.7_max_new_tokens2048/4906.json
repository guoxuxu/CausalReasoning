  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt} F(t) dt \\\\, C \\\\) where C is the contour in the complex plane and F(t) is an analytic function. We are investigating the implications of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\( L[G] \\\\) on \\\\( G(z) \\\\).\n\nCan the original function \\\\( G(z) \\\\) be reconstructed uniquely by merely observing the transformed function after applying \\\\( L[G] \\\\) without knowing the specifics of L?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit details of the transformation operator L, the operation might introduce or obscure information that is integral to reconstructing the original function uniquely. Hence, the original function cannot be accurately determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
