  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time. The function is impacted initially by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) (where A is a complex constant and t is time). We analyze the effect of an operational matrix L of the Laplace transform applied to z(t).\n\nDoes the application of the Laplace transform L to the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0, without further intervention, result in the same transformed outcome at t = T as if the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly transformed under its natural evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The operational effects of the matrix L combined with the initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modify how the function evolves through the complex plane, altering its Laplace transform. The nature of the complex exponent \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which twists and scales z(t), results in a different outcome than if \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s natural evolution was transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
