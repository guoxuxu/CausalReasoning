  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over a period \\\\(T\\\\).\n\nGiven a nonzero result for \\\\(T(z)\\\\), can we determine whether an intervention such as a frequency shift by \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) was applied only by knowing the result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The nonzero result of \\\\(T(z)\\\\) indicates a deviation from the original \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over the evaluated period, but it does not specify what kind of perturbation occurred. Various interventions could produce similar alterations in the integral transform, such as different values of \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) or even changes in the amplitude or phase of the exponential function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
