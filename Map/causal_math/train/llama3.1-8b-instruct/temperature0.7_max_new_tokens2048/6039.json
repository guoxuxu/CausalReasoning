  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) denote the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\) respectively. The system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. Let us explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z(t)) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying a Laplace transform \\\\( L(z(t)) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) at a certain t1, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 solely depend on the dynamics defined by A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( L(z(t)) \\\\) introduces another transformation which changes the system’s trajectory and, thus, the final outcome depends on both the initial action of A and B as well as the effects introduced by the Laplace transform. These transformations impact the system's trajectory in a combined manner depending on the specific values of A, B, and s (from the Laplace transform).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
