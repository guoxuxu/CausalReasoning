  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar, is analyzed for its effects over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The possible overlap in the effects of C and D on the trajectory of z from t = 0 to T means multiple combinations of interventions could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The scalar exponential factors influencing the real and imaginary parts independently complicate the ability to uniquely trace back the interventions without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
