  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) for complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. By defining a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix, we test the effect over a period of time t.\n\nIf an intervention by a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) (with E a constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 depend solely on C and not on D or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) further complicates the system by introducing yet another layer of transformation. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus becomes dependent on the interplay between C, D, and E, with each transformation potentially affecting the trajectory and final conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
