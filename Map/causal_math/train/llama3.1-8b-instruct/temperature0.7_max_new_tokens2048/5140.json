  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nGiven results from the integral transformation at time t > t2 where an intervention with matrix S occurred, can we determine whether the original or modified system governed the effect without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "With results obtained post-intervention, you cannot conclusively distinguish if the integral's output derived from the original eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) or their modified form \\\\( S\\\\lambda_iS^{-1} \\\\) without explicit knowledge of the intervention's specifics. Ambiguity arises due to the integral reflecting the current system's state, irrespective of its genesis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "intervention with matrix S → eigenvalues of A change; eigenvalues of A change → matrix A changes; matrix A change → function h(z) changes; function h(z) change → integral transformation result changes; intervention with matrix S → time t > t2; time t > t2 → additional information not available"
