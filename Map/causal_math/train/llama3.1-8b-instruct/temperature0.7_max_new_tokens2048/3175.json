  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output signal \\( z(t) \\) is determined by applying a Laplace transform \\( L \\) to an input signal \\( x(t) \\). The transfer function in the Laplace domain is given by \\( H(s) = \\frac{s + a}{s + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by applying a different modulation \\( n(t) \\) is made, resulting in \\( L(n(t) z(t)) = N(s)Z(s) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\), will the final output \\( Z_f(s) \\) depend on \\( N(s) \\) and not be determined purely by \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\( n(t) \\) introduces a new variable \\( N(s) \\) which modulates the already transformed output \\( Z(s) \\). Hence, the final output \\( Z_f(s) \\) is now \\( H(s)M(s)N(s)X(s) \\), clearly affected by \\( N(s) \\), and thus not determined solely by \\( H(s) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
