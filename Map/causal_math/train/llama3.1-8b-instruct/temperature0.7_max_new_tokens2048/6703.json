  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nAssuming a new intervention in the form of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, ignoring the effects of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "Since the additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) also plays a role, the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent not only on A and B but also on the complex constants C and D. These transformations interact multiplicatively, and thus their combined effect must be accounted for.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
