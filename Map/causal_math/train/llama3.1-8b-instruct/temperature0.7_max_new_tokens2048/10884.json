  "Problem": "Consider the relationship governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), representing the unit circle in the complex plane. Study the behavior of the system when a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we conclusively determine whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both were applied, merely from the value of \\( z(T) \\) and knowing it follows \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\( z(T) \\) provides the endpoint of a trajectory on the unit circle, the potential to reach this point through multiple distinct sequences of applications of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) (i.e., squaring and cubing transformations) creates ambiguity. This is due to the multiplicative nature of the transformations affecting the angle in the exponential function, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack the interventions from the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
