  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a complex oscillation on the unit circle in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined for any function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we uniquely identify the scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\) and the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the Laplace transform of the transformed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for a known \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, especially without constraining additional parameters, does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine both the scaling factor and the frequency. Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) might produce similar transformations for a given \\\\( s \\\\), making unique identification infeasible without further data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
