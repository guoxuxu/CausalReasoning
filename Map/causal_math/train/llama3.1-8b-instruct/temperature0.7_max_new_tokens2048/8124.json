  "Problem": "Assume that we have a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a linear operator represented by a matrix. We consider the modification caused by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = N^t z \\\\), where N is also a matrix representation of a linear operator.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the interventions that were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( i(z) \\\\), or both) using only the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved via various combinations of transformations and interventions, specifically if N, M, and P have non-commuting properties. The same endpoint could potentially be reached from different innovative and interaction patterns among applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
