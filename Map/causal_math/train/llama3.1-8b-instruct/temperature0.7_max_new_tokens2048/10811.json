  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by complex function theory, where \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a given function. Assess how transformations by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which acts on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) as \\\\( L[f(x)] = f(ax+b) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, affect the outcome in terms of the causality and intervention.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by modifying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) to a new operator \\\\( M[f(x)] = f(cx+d) \\\\) at a certain point, will the outcome of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) now only depend on the new operator \\\\( M \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral will carry the effects of both transformations, first by \\\\( L \\\\) and then modified by \\\\( M \\\\). Each of these operations alters the input function, affecting the integral outcome due to variations introduced by constants in both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
