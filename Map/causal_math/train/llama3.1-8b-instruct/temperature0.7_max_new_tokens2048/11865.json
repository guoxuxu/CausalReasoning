  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, with an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and an output \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Let's assume an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is applied where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf only \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is known, can we determine if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before computing the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) or the usage of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) merely from \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) is challenging without additional information about the possible transformations applied prior to the Laplace transform, due to the many potential functions that could yield the same transformed result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
