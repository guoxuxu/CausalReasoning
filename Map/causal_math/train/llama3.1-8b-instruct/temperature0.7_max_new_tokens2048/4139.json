  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{pt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( m, n \\\\) or \\\\( p \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a product of interactions between \\\\( m, n, p, \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\). Each exponent contributes differently, influencing both magnitude and phase of the solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
