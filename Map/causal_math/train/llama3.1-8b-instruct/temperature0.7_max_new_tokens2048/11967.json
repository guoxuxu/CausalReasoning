  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a vector space described by a matrix 𝐌. An integral transformation \\\\( T[𝐱](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}𝐌𝐱(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where 𝐱(t) is a vector function affected over time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the final result of the Laplace transform \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\), can we accurately determine if the transformation by \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) or any subsequent intervention by \\\\( 𝐍 \\\\) was applied, solely from the value of \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of both \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) and any intervention transformations like \\\\( 𝐍 \\\\) on the integral transformation result in multiple possible trajectories that could lead to the same resulting transform \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\). The complex interplay and potential non-unique mapping from the result back to initial conditions or transformations prevents precise identification of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
