  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i \\theta}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\theta \\\\) is a constant phase shift.\n\nAssuming that at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{i \\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces an additional phase shift, which, along with the initial modification by \\\\( h(z) \\\\), affects the trajectory and final state at T. Thus, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is affected by both \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\phi \\\\), not just the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
