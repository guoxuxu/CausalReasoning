  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nGiven only the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we identify if there was an intervention at some time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\) and what that intervention was?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of interventions or precise changes in conditions at some previous point purely from the endpoint data \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) is not feasible. Multiple potential interventions or modifications at \\\\(t_1\\\\) could lead to the same observed endpoint, especially given the heat equation's sensitivity to initial and boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
