  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents a control input. When a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx\\\\), with \\\\(Q\\\\) as a constant matrix, is applied, the dynamic response characteristics of the system are altered.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at t = T be directly predictable by simply using \\\\(D\\\\) to project \\\\(x_0\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "By altering the initial state via the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx_0\\\\), the system's trajectory will evolve differently under the dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\). The transformation \\\\(Q\\\\) reshapes the initial conditions and thus the evolution path, making it distinct from the direct projection by \\\\(D\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
