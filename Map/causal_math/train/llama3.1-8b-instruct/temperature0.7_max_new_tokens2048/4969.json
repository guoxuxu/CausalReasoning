  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using Fourier Transform at t = 0, and further evolved with its dynamics under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) without any additional intervention, will the transformed state at t = T match the Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) directly applied at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform alters the frequency components of the signal, and additional evolution under \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) will shift and potentially dampen or amplify these components differently than if it were applied directly at t = T. Thus, the sequence and timing of application affect the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
