  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a Laplace transform where the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Ky \\\\) governs the evolution of the function y(t). We apply a transformation \\\\( f(y) = L^{-1}(P(s) L(y(s))) \\\\), where P(s) is a polynomial in s and L denotes the Laplace transform.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( y_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The operation involving L, P(s), and L^{-1} modifies the frequency components and dissipative/amplifying factors of the system in ways that are generally irreversible without explicit knowledge of P(s). Therefore, uniquely determining \\\\( y_0(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing P(s) is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
