  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is a time-dependent input vector and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of introducing a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) over time t, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf after a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied as an intervention and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is computed to t = T for T > t_1, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still reflect the initial matrix A irrespective of the intervention with B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\), that is \\\\( e^{Bt}x \\\\), affects the input from t_1 to T, changing how the integration accumulates contributions of the modified input vector towards \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the influences of both A and B post-intervention, making it dependent on the specifics of both matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
