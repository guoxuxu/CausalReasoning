  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source influences the system described by \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) being added to certain regions at specific times.\n\nIf a specific heat source profile \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and then removed at \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the temperature distribution at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_2 \\\\)) be independent of the heat source profile?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction and subsequent removal of a heat source alters the temperature distribution transiently, and these changes persist even after the source is removed. The final temperature distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) retains memory of this intervention, thus not being solely dictated by the initial conditions or natural diffusion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
