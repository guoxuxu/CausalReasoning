  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2tz \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nBased on the transformed output \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively identify whether an intervention occurred at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and determine the value of c?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the intervention (adding ct to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)) blends into the integral operation involving the exponential term \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\). This results in a mixed modification over the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, making it complicated to disentangle and precisely attribute changes in \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T to the intervention or to determine the constant c specifically.",
