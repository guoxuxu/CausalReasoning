  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, any observed rotation or change in phase of the vector cannot be confidently attributed to either the intrinsic behavior or the transformation. Consequently, the original value \\\\(z_0\\\\) cannot be determined uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
