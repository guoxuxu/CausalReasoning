  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) evolves according to the linear time-invariant system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) an input vector. We are interested in examining the effects of implementing an input transformation \\\\(u(t) = D v(t)\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represents a new transformed input.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(v(t) = E w(t)\\\\) (where E is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A but not on B, D, or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(v(t) = E w(t)\\\\) adds another layer of input modification, affecting the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) depending on B, D, and E, as well as the system matrix A. Each of these transformations impact how the control input shapes the evolution of the state vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
