  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), particularly under the influence of a derivative operation, defined by \\\\( g(t) = d^n(t) / dt^n \\\\) where n is a positive integer.\n\nIf we apply the nth derivative operation to \\\\(f(t)\\\\) before taking its Laplace transform, will the result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the derivative operation changes the function from \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\), which leads to a mathematical modification reflected in the Laplace domain. Specifically, the Laplace transform of a derivative introduces additional powers of s, changing the nature of the transform: \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} = s^nF(s) - s^{n-1}f(0) - ... - f^{(n-1)}(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
