  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. The impact of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t, x)\\\\}(s)\\\\) is analyzed to understand its effects on the solution trajectory over variable \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{bx}\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be independent of the original transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\(g(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) adds another level of spatial transformation which interacts with the initial modification brought by \\\\(f(x)\\\\). The resulting state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) will be dependent on both transformations, affecting the final outcome through the compounded effect of sequential spatial changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
