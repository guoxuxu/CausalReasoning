  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The transformation studied involves the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, does the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) match the original evolution of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) without using \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory from a simple exponential growth to one that integrates past states of the system due to the transformation's accumulating nature. This makes the new system trajectory different from the unaltered exponential evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
