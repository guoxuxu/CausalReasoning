  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the influence of the transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) operating in the complex plane.\n\nUpon observing the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T, can we conclude whether the Laplace transform had been applied at an earlier time without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the function to a representation in the frequency domain and isn’t directly observable in the time evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations unless specific inverse transform effects are detectable, which is generally not the case without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
