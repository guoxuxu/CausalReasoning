  "Problem": "Evaluate the real part of the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a, b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(t\\\\) is the time variable. We explore an integral transformation by applying Laplace transform on this complex function.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform result after a phase shift, can the original function be exactly recovered including the value of the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift introduces an ambiguity, as the same modified Laplace transform result could possibly be produced by different combinations of phase shifts and alterations in the original function’s parameters. Thus, without additional information, exact recovery including the phase shift value is not achievable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
