  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. We examine the effect of applying the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), on this function over the variable 's', a complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is it always possible to uniquely retrieve the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information or assumptions?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace Transform used to retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) may not always uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing initial conditions or specific boundary behaviors. Ambiguities can arise in cases of non-unique mappings from the complex frequency domain back to the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
