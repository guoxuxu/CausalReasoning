  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a real constant, over time \\\\( t \\\\) is scrutinized.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial state to \\\\( e^{C0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as t progresses, the influence of \\\\( C \\\\) in \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), leading to a different endpoint than that obtained from mere evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\). The effect of the transformation is compounded by the exponential growth factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
