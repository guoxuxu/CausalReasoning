  "Problem": "Investigate a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where y(t) is the response of a circuit involving a unit step function shifted by a time delay \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), and knowing a transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied, can we explicitly determine if the transformation was the square power \\\\( t^2 \\\\) or another function like \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), solely based on \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to multiple transformations' ability to alter the sign and position of poles and zeros in the Laplace spectrum, it is infeasible to uniquely determine whether the input was transformed by \\\\( t^2 \\\\), \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\), or another similar modification without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "Transformation → Laplace Transform Output Y(s); Unit Step Function → Time Delay δ; Time Delay δ → Shifted Response y(t); Transformation → Shifted Response y(t); Shifted Response y(t) → Laplace Transform Output Y(s); Y(s) → g(t); g(t) → Square Power t^2 or e^(-at)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A transformation applied to a unit step function with a time delay causes a shift in the response, which results in a Laplace transform output Y(s), and this output can be related back to the original transformation, but the specific transformation type (square power or exponential decay) cannot be determined solely from Y(s) without additional information."
