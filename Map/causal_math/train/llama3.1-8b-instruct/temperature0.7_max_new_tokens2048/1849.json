  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We study the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) being another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) over a time period T without any transformation applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) had been applied continuously from t = 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Without the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the system simply follows the path given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\). When \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied, it accumulates complex values influenced by both \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), leading to a different outcome because integral transformations generally modify the trajectory by amalgamating the effects over the interval.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
