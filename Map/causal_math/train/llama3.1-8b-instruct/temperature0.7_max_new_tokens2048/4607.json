  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on the characteristics of both transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The interaction of the two transformations, \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\), introduces additional complexity. The final state \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) will reflect the combined effects of both transformations, where each contributes differently depending on their integration limits and exponential factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
