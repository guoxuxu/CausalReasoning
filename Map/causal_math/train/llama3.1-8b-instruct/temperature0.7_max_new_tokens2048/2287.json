  "Problem": "Let's consider the complex plane where the function is defined as \\( z \\mapsto w = e^z \\). Investigate how the transformation of this function affects the analytical structure of a complex domain, specifically whether causal inference about the original complex value (z) can be derived from its transformation (w) under various circumstances.\n\nIf an intervention changes the function to \\( w = e^{z+C} \\) where C is a constant, does the final outcome \\( w \\) for any \\( z \\) depend only on the new configuration and not on historical data of \\( z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( w = e^{z + C} \\) uniformly shifts every point z by the constant C in the exponent, which directly determines the final state \\( w \\) independent of the prior state of z. As a result, this transformation depends solely on the present configuration of z incorporating C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
