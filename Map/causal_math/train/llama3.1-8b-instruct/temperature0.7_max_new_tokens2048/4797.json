  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) is a time-dependent input signal and \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. The dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) in the system are described by a complex function \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear transformation.\n\nIf the transformation \\( z(t) \\) is applied to the signal \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( x(t+1) = L x(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\( z(t) = e^{j\\omega t} x(t) \\) introduces a complex exponential modulation to the signal, which changes its phase and potentially its amplitude, depending on \\( \\omega \\). This alteration affects the signal’s evolution under \\( L \\), leading to a different result at time \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
