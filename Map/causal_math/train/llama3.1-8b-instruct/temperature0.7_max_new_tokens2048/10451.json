  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze how the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter, affects the output.\n\nIf a corrective term \\\\( h(z) = z + p \\\\) (where \\\\( p \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and both functions \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) affect the system, will the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) depend on the original parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds a complex constant \\\\( p \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), changing the trajectory and outcomes even after applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The final output relies on the interaction of \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\), and the introduced constant \\\\( p \\\\), altering the complexity of the dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
