  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega t + c)} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real positive frequency and \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T_\\lambda [z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we exactly determine the original function parameters \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( T_\\lambda [z](T) \\\\) at any time T without any knowledge about \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation introduces a component dependent on \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), which mixes with the effects of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), we cannot uniquely decompose \\\\( T_\\lambda [z](T) \\\\) to retrieve \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) unequivocally.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
