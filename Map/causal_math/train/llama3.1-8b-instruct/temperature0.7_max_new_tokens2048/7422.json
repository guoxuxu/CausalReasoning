  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants. We investigate how the application of an input signal function transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) impacts the output over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modified by \\\\( e^{dt} \\\\), it's not possible to accurately trace back to the original input just by analyzing the output. The transformation could significantly alter the spectral characteristics, leaving ambiguity in the causality from output back to the original input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
