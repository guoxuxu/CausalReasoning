  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the influence of the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) from the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) observed at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the evolution law \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}z = i\\\\omega z \\\\), the form of the function in the frequency domain remains consistent. Thus, knowledge of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) uniquely determines the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to a constant phase factor, even at the initial time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
