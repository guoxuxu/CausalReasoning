  "Problem": "Consider a signal process represented by a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = L\\{z(t)\\} \\), where \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an input signal modified by the transformation \\( h(t) = e^{Bt} \\) on the system's response over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(t) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( h(t) \\), it's impossible to accurately trace back the original signal due to the potential modification introduced by \\( e^{Bt} \\), especially if B does not commute with A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
