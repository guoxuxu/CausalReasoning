  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - a^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant parameter. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\), particularly focusing on changes over time in the spectral domain defined by \\\\( k \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from observing the function in the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied at any point?",
  "Explanation": "Without assured knowledge of the transformation status at the initial time, it's uncertain if \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) results directly from initial conditions or transformed conditions. The information loss about initial applications of transformations prevents the exact reversion to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
