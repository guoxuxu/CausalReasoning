  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of t. The Laplace Transform of z is defined as \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). Consider the impact of the differential operator D on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented as \\\\( Dz(t) = z'(t) \\\\) and its effect on the transformed function.\n\nCan the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be precisely identified after applying \\\\( D \\\\) and observing \\\\( L(D(z + w))(s) \\\\) in the transformed domain if \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( L(D(z + w))(s) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is infeasible since the intervention mixes effects of both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The overlap in transformations due to these functions makes it impossible to disentangle and uniquely retrieve the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the given data alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
