  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nCan we precisely determine the functional form of the intervention \\(g(t)\\) based solely on observing the transformed result \\(X(s-k)e^{-s\\tau}\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformed result \\(X(s-k)e^{-s\\tau}\\) indicates a shift and a scaling, multiple interventions or different parameters \\(k\\) and \\(\\tau\\) can yield a similar effect in the Laplace domain. Without additional data, identifying the exact nature of \\(g(t)\\) and separation from \\(k\\) is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
