  "Problem": "Investigate a discrete dynamical system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant square matrix representing the evolution operator, and \\\\( x_n \\\\) is the state vector at the n-th step. We also explore the influence on the system of applying a nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is introduced to initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state vector \\\\( x_n \\\\) at step n be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to step n under \\\\( M \\\\) with no initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( x_0 + u \\\\). Each subsequent step multiplies this altered state by \\\\( M \\\\). Hence, the trajectory of \\\\( x_n \\\\) is shifted by \\\\( M^n u \\\\) at every step compared to the purely linear evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\( M \\\\), resulting in a different state vector at each step.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
