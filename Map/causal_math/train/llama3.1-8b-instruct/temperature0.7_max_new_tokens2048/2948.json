  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) describes the evolution of a variable vector \\\\( z \\\\) through a linear transformation system in time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. Another function \\\\( w(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix, applies another linear transformation at an arbitrary time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\), \\\\( v(z) \\\\), or both) merely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various sequences of transformations involving \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\). There may be indistinguishable effects due to different properties of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) that could lead to a similar state, complicating the clear identification of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
