  "Problem": "Let the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Consider an intervention where a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i \\theta t}z + c \\\\), with constants \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), is applied.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were employed (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), just by knowing the configuration of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the endpoint could potentially be achieved through different combinations of interventions due to the possible overlaps in the influences of phase shifts and translations enacted by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). Without additional data about the sequence or types of interventions applied, it is unfeasible to conclusively determine what modifications were made to the dynamical system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
