  "Problem": "Investigate the influence of a linear operator transformation \\\\( z = L(x) \\\\) on a vector field \\\\( x \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The transformation L represents another linear operator with a constant matrix.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be reliably determined at t = 0 after observing the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing if the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( L \\\\), reconstructing the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is not straightforward. The application of L can alter the vector in ways that are not easily reversible, especially if L and M are not designed to reveal their effects straightforwardly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
