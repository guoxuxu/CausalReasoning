  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a rotational motion in the complex plane. We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) applied at time T affects this motion.\n\nIf the integral transformation H(z) is applied at T and then allows the system to evolve with the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) until time t > T without further intervention, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be identical to its evolution without applying \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) computes an integral over a fixed interval and does not affect the underlying function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), which continues to evolve independently. Thus, the post-transformation evolution at t > T remains unaffected and identical as if \\\\( H(z) \\\\) had not been applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
