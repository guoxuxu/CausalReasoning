  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nCan we precisely infer the specific time and the type of interventions, such as the application of a Fourier transform, applied during the evolution from observing the population distribution at a later time \\\\( t_2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact nature and timing of interventions like a Fourier transform solely from the population distribution at a later time is highly challenging due to the diffusion process's tendency to smear out details and the potential variety of equivalent transformation effects possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
