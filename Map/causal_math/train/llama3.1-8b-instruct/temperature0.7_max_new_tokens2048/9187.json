  "Problem": "Consider the integral equation of the form \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix determining the system's dynamics and f(s) is a vector function. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse on this system.\n\nIf an intervention is introduced at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is modified by another function \\\\( g(s) = e^{B(t_1-s)}f(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s > t_1 \\\\), will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) after intervention depend only on the initial A and not on the new modification pattern B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(s) \\\\) incorporates new system dynamics via \\\\( B \\\\), significantly affecting the subsequent behavior modelled by the integral equation. Therefore, the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) reflects dependencies both on the initial matrix A and the intervention's matrix B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
