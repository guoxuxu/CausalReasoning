  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by a set of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')\\\\, dt'\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nIs it possible to precisely recover the original complex function \\\\(z_0\\\\) after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear information about the application or non-application of \\\\(T(z)\\\\), and given the integral's effect over the complex function, multiple initial conditions could yield the same result at t = T. The indeterminate nature of back-tracking an integral amplitude modulation makes it difficult.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
