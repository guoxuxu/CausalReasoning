  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex constant, in the context of an integral transformation. We are particularly interested in the causality analysis between transformations and original functions.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform resulting from an operation involving A and an uncertain linear transformation M, can we unerringly deduce the exact form of M?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform is affected by the composition of A and M, leading to generalized forms that do not uniquely specify M. Different M matrices could yield similar effects on the transformation outcome, obscuring a direct determination of M from the Laplace transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → M; A → Laplace transform; M → Laplace transform; M → g(t); g(t) → Laplace transform; A → g(t)"
