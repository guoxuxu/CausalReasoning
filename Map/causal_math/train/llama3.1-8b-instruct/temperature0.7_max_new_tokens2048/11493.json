  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^{Aw} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and w is a complex variable. Suppose we perform an integral transformation on z(w) given by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sw}z(w) dw \\\\), where s is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is mapped using the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) from w = 0 to w = t without any additional modifications, will \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time t = T be influenced solely by constant A?",
  "Explanation": "While A directly influences the form of \\\\( z(w) \\\\), the integral transformation involves another complex constant s, which impacts how \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is integrated over the interval [0, t]. Thus, \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) also depends on s as well as A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
