  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) used to solve differential equations. Assume the system is initially impacted by a function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\), and later, an intervention using the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(\\\\omega)\\\\) applied to the result.\n\nCan we determine from the final Fourier and Laplace domain data whether the initial function was \\\\( t^2 \\\\) or another quadratic function, if only the Laplace followed by Fourier transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The similarity in Laplace and Fourier transforms for quadratic functions makes it challenging to identify exclusively that \\\\( t^2 \\\\) was the initial function solely based on the final domain representations. Other similar quadratic functions could produce indistinguishably similar transform results, especially after compounded transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
