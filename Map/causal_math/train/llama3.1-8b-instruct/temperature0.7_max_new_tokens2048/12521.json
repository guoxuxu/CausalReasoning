  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced accurately after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( w(z) \\\\), the transformation offsets the initial state in an unknown way, specifically through altering the phase. Without knowing the phase change introduced by \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
