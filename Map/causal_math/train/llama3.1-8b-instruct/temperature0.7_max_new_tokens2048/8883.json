  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic economic model governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where x and u denote state and control vectors respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We observe the effect of input changes via the transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) for some constant matrix C.\n\nIf at a time t = t_1 a different transformation function \\\\( h(u) = Du \\\\) is applied where D is another constant matrix, will the different transformations at t = 0 and t_1 independently affect \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1?",
  "Explanation": "The successive transformations modulate the control vector at different times, creating a compounding effect on the system's trajectory. Each matrix transformation (C at t = 0 and D at t = t_1) independently alters the dynamics under \\\\( Bu \\\\), leading to a distinct state trajectory by time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
