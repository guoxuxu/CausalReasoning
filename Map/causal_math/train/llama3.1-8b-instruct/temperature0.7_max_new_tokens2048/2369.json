  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a complex oscillation on the unit circle in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined for any function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the function is allowed to evolve without further transformation, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( s = i \\\\omega \\\\) equal zero?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) at \\\\( s = i \\\\omega \\\\) results in an integral that does not converge, hence it is not zero but undefined or typically considered as diverging. This indicates that the evaluation of the Laplace transform at the same frequency as the oscillation does not stabilize to a finite value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
