  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the Laplace transform domain, where a is a constant. This function corresponds to the solution \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) being a step function. We analyze the impact of multiplying by another function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), corresponding to \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, and where b is also a constant.\n\nIf a correction function \\\\( q(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-c} \\\\) (where c is a constant) is added in the Laplace domain to \\\\( h(s) \\\\) at some time during its evolution, and then the inverse transform is taken, will the resulting time-domain function be solely determined by the original functions \\\\( z(s) \\\\) or \\\\( g(s) \\\\) without the effects of \\\\( q(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( q(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse Laplace transform (which corresponds to another exponential function, \\\\( e^{ct} u(t) \\\\)) will convolute with the current state and further modify the resulting function in the time domain. This implies that the outcomes in time domain are influenced by all three functions, not just the original ones.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
