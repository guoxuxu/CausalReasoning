  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Suppose the transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve without further intervention through inverse transformation, will the reconstructed signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t be the same as if \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) was inversely transformed without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the Laplace domain representation by introducing a pole at \\\\( s = a \\\\), which fundamentally alters the time-domain behavior of the system. This will lead to a different signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) than the one that would be obtained directly from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
