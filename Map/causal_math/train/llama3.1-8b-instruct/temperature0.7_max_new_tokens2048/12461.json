  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Examining the impact of the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential application of transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\), which modifies \\\\(z_0\\\\) by \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\), reconstructing the original \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is not feasible without the knowledge of whether the transformation took place, especially since C might not commute with A or B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
