  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear operator. An intervention is applied via a transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + h(t)\\\\), with h(t) representing a controlled input function.\n\nCan we uniquely determine, based on \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) alone, whether the intervention was modified from \\\\(h(t)\\\\) to \\\\(h'(t)\\\\) at some \\\\(t_1\\\\), knowing only the form of \\\\(h'(t)\\\\) and not \\\\(h(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) results from complex interactions between the initial conditions, the operator L, and the changes in interventions. Several different scenarios involving changes from \\\\(h(t)\\\\) to \\\\(h'(t)\\\\) could yield the same final state, especially without precise knowledge of the original intervention \\\\(h(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
