  "Problem": "Examine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix \\\\(A\\\\) and their changes after the matrix undergoes a linear transformation \\\\( T(A) = B^{-1}AB \\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is an invertible matrix.\n\nIf an additional matrix transformation \\\\( S(A) = C^{-1}AC \\\\) is applied after \\\\( T(A) \\\\) at some point, will the eigenvalues of the final matrix depend only on the eigenvalues of \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformation, involving \\\\( C \\\\) after the initial transformation by \\\\( B \\\\), will still result in a matrix that has the same eigenvalues as \\\\( A \\\\), despite going through two different transformations. This is because both \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) transformations are similarity transformations, and eigenvalues are invariant under such transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
