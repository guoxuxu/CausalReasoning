  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), where A is a constant coefficient. We explore the influence of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{B(x-s)}u(s)ds \\) on the solution \\( u(x,t) \\), where B is another constant coefficient.\n\nCan we deduce the original initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\) after observing \\( u(x,T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( T(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\( T(u) \\) was applied, the evolved state \\( u(x,T) \\) with its possibly altered distribution due to convolution cannot uniquely determine the original initial condition, especially since the convolution might dampen or amplify certain features of \\( u(x,0) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
