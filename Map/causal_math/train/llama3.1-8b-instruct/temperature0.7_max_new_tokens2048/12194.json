  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t,x) \\\\) is the temperature distribution over a domain. We investigate the effect of introducing a source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\) applied from time t = 0, described mathematically as \\\\( u_t = \\\\Delta u + S(x) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a modification of the boundary condition or an additional source term \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\) is introduced, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\) be only dependent on the original source term \\\\( S(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a new source term \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\) or altering the boundary conditions at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) can significantly influence the system dynamics and the resulting temperature distribution. The effects of \\\\( S(x) \\\\) and \\\\( S_2(x) \\\\) and any change in boundary condition accumulate, influence diffusion, and affect the final state \\\\( u(T,x) \\\\), making it dependent on more than just the original source term.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
