  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(t) \\\\)'s Laplace transform at some future time T, can we recover the exact form of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) have altered?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the parameters \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely invert the Laplace transform and accurately trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The parameters could have significantly manipulated the dynamics and initial conditions encoded in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
