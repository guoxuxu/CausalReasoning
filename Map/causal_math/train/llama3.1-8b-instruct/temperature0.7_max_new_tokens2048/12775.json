  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over a complex domain, where \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\\\) with matrices A and B. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) to analyze its properties in the frequency domain.\n\nIf only the Fourier-transformed outcome \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) of the modified function is provided, can we pinpoint the exact role or structure of the intervention matrix C?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific properties or structure of matrix C based only on the Fourier-transformed outcome is challenging due to the intertwining effects with matrices A and B. Diverse matrices can produce similar transformations, resulting in ambiguity regarding the exact nature or influence of C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
