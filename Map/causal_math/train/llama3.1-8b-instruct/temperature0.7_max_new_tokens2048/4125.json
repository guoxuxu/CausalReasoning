  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate how the transformation by the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\) without any other intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from what would occur if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) increasingly influences the solution trajectory due to its multiplicative effect with \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory and final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
