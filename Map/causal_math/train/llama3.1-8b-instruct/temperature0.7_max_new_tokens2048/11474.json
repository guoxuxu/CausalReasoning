  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) as a signal through a linear system described by the transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-ix}z(x)dx \\\\). We explore the causal inference ability by analyzing the system's response using advanced calculus and integral transformations.\n\nGiven the output from the system, \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can one infer the exact function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such as \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), assuming no knowledge of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple functions could theoretically yield the same result under the integral transformation due to properties of the Fourier transform and orthogonality in function space, making it impossible to conclusively determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
