  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario with the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{st} \\\\). An external intervention uses the Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to modify the function before its evolution.\n\nGiven the output of the Laplace transform after unknown interventions (either Fourier transform, inversion operator, or both), can we deduce which interventions were applied by only analyzing the Laplace transform output?",
  "Explanation": "The final state, as influenced by potentially multiple and overlapping transformations (Fourier and causal inversion), can arise from various sequences of these operations. The Laplace transform alone, being a linear and invertible operation in this context, doesn't provide information to uniquely determine the sequence or specific types of interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
