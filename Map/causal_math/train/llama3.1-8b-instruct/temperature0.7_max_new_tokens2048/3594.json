  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\), where f(t) is an original function in the time domain. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\\\) where k is a non-negative integer, and the implication of such transformations on the resulting function in the complex s-domain.\n\nGiven \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) solely by knowing the integer k?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing k provides a method to adjust the differentiation level in the s-domain, it does not contain sufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\), as multiple time domain functions could potentially result in the same transformed expression after applying the derivative operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
