  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), altering the trajectory. Assuming that \\\\( C \\\\) is not a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, the transformation shifts the phase and potentially amplifies or diminishes the magnitude, resulting in a different endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved directly under the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
