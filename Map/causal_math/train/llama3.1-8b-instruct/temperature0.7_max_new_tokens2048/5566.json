  "Problem": "Evaluate the nonlinear system governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = z^n + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex function of a real variable \\\\( t \\\\), \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, and \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider transformations using a function \\\\( h(z) = z^{m} \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is an integer, applied at different time points.\n\nIf we observe \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved from either \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z_0) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given just the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and considering the nonlinear dynamics and potential multiple roots arising from polynomial expressions, it cannot be definitively concluded if the initial condition was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z_0) = z_0^m \\\\). Multiple initial conditions can lead to the same final state due to the complex powers involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
