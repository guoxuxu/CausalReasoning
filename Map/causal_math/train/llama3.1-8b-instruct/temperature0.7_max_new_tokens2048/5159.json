  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are also complex constants.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another transformation \\\\( h(z) = ez + f \\\\) (where \\\\( e \\\\) and \\\\( f \\\\) are complex constants) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) after \\\\( g(z) \\\\) but before \\\\( f(z) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( f(h(g(z_0))) \\\\) depend solely on the parameters of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on those of \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output of \\\\( f(h(g(z_0))) \\\\) is influenced by the parameters of all involved transformations (\\\\( g, h, \\\\) and the non-linearities within \\\\( f \\\\)). The sequence and parameters of these transformations directly influence the resulting values, determining the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
