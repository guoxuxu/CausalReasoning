  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( g(z) = e^{-i\\omega t}z \\) (counteracting \\( f(z) \\)) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\( T(z)(T) \\) be equivalent to that obtained from evolving \\( z_0 \\) under \\( M \\) without \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\( g(z) \\) is designed to counteract \\( f(z) \\), the non-commutative nature of the transformations and the irreversible effects of the integral and differential transformation processes mean that intervening with \\( g(z) \\) does not exactly reverse the modifications caused by \\( f(z) \\). The result \\( T(z)(T) \\) therefore differs from the unmodified trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
