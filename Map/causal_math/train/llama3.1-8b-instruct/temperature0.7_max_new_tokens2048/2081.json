  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) is computed for the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any additional operations or manipulations, will the resulting transformation be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) had not undergone the transformation \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) accumulates the effect of the complex exponential function over the interval [0, T], resulting in a new function different from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The operation fundamentally alters the output by integrating the oscillatory behavior of the exponential function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
