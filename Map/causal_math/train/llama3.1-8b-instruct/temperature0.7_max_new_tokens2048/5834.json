  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We analyze the potential effects of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where S is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed at time T, is it possible to deduce precisely the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), which modifies the initial state and integrates the evolving function over time, it is impossible to retroactively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed state at T, affected by the integral operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
