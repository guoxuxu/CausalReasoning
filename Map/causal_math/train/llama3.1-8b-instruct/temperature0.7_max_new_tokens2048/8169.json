  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation described by \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function in time. We investigate the causal relationships under the application of the Fourier Transform \\\\( F \\\\), a complex integral transformation defined for function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and analyzing the transformed function over time without any further modification provide the same outcome as the direct application of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier Transform changes the function from time domain to frequency domain, which alters the characteristics and behavior of the original function. Applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and to the Fourier Transformed version of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will generally yield different results because \\\\( L \\\\) may interact differently with these representations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
