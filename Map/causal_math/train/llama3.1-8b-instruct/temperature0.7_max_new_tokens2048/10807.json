  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate what happens when a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied on the initial temperature distribution, and later an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is used.\n\nIf a different transformation, say a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied to the system state at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we still ensure that the ultimate temperature profile at any later time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) can be successfully recovered by only applying the inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Laplace transform as an intervention introduces additional complexities and changes state representation, which are not directly reversible through the inverse Fourier transform alone, thereby affecting the accuracy of recovering later state solely based on the inverse Fourier process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
