  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an additional damping factor represented by \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) (for \\\\( a > 0 \\\\)) is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform, will the spectrum still be a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the damping factor \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) modifies the original function to \\\\( e^{(i\\\\omega - a)t} \\\\), and its Fourier transform results in a peak shifted from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and broadened, reflecting the decay rate \\\\( a \\\\). This alteration makes the spectrum not a pure delta function and not solely centered on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
