  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and the function maps a real value \\\\(t\\\\) to a point on the complex unit circle. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Az\\\\), where A is a complex square matrix, at different times.\n\nKnowing the system state at time \\\\(T\\\\), is it feasible to uniquely identify which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\) and/or \\\\(g(z)\\\\)) were applied earlier, assuming the time periods of their application are known?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specifics of the transformations only from the end state is inherently challenging as multiple combinations of parameters and even the application order of \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) can yield similar end states. This is especially so without knowing the specifics of each matrix transformation and considering the continuous and cyclic nature of the complex exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
