  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original \\\\( ω \\\\) without considering the impacts of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\\\). The squaring operation alters the frequency, and the reciprocal transformation \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) will change both the magnitude and phase of the trajectory. Thus, the endpoint depends significantly on both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
