  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}(t-s)p(s)ds \\\\), and where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is the input signal. The integral kernel \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) represents the system's response to the input, transitioning over time.\n\nIs it possible to determine if the matrix was changed during the interval [0, T] purely based on the output signal \\\\( z(T) \\\\), assuming no information on the form of the input signal \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is available?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the input signal \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and the exact interventions on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), any changes in dynamics represented by a different output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot conclusively indicate whether an intervention occurred or what type it was. The output could result from various transformations and inputs, rendering such backward inference unreliable.",
