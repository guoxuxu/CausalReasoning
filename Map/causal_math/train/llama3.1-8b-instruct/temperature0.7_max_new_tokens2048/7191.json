  "Problem": "Examine the implications of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), with D as a constant matrix, upon inclusion of a linear operator mapping \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), where F is another constant matrix applied intermittently.\n\nShould an intervention via the application of \\\\( k(x) = e^{Gt}x \\\\) (where G is another constant matrix) be implemented at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 merely depend on the matrix D and not on F or G?",
  "Explanation": "The introduced intervention modifies the trajectory. Thus, the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by the matrices F and G, in addition to D. The interplay and possible non-commutation between these transformations alter the end state significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
