  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + c\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. Evaluate the stability and transformation of the function under an integral transformation, defined as \\\\( T_h[f](z) = \\\\int_0^1 e^{ht} f(tz) dt \\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a real constant parameter.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is initially applied to a complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) without any transformations and then subjected to the integral transformation \\\\(T_h\\\\), will the outcome at \\\\(z = 1\\\\) for \\\\( T_h[f] \\\\) be the same as simply evaluating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation incorporates a continuous blend of function evaluations across a scaled domain of \\\\(z_0\\\\), differing significantly from a single evaluation of \\\\(f\\\\) at \\\\(z_0\\\\). The transformation integrates values dependent on the function's behavior over a range, altering the outcome at \\\\( z = 1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
