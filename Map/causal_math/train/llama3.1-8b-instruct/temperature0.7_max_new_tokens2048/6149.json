  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a specific \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and then allowed to evolve naturally, will the resultant function at time t = T be the same as if no transformation \\\\( T \\\\) but just natural evolution occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) results in an integral of the function over time, which modifies its behavior significantly from natural exponential growth. Instead of rotating about the origin, the transformed function accumulates values, reflecting a growth in magnitude that is distinctively different from the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
