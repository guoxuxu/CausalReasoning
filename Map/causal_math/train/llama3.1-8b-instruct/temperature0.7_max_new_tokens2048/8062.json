  "Problem": "In a quantum mechanical system, an operator \\\\( P(x) = -i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) is employed to measure the momentum of a particle in state \\\\( \\\\psi(x) \\\\). We consider how changes to the quantum state through different transformations influence measurements. One such transformation involves the function \\\\( F(\\\\psi) = e^{ikx} \\\\psi(x) \\\\), where k is a real number representing a shift in momentum.\n\nCan we determine the original quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed state at t = T, without knowing whether transformation \\\\( F(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the presence and specifics (value of k) of the transformation \\\\( F(\\\\psi) \\\\), the momentum information alone, altered by an unknown phase shift, is insufficient to reconstruct the original state \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) due to the inability to distinguish between original and momentum-shifted components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
