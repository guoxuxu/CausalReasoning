  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t, z) dt \\\\), where \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is a function of both the real variable t and the complex variable z. This transformation maps complex functions into other complex functions using an integral transform influenced by the parameter s.\n\nIf the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) in the integral transform is changed from \\\\( s_0 \\\\) to \\\\( s_1 \\\\) at t = 0, and the transform is then computed without further change, will the resulting function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) for \\\\( s_1 \\\\) be the same as it would be using \\\\( s_0 \\\\) over the entire interval?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) modifies the weighting of the exponential function in the integral transform, thus altering the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The decay rate imparted by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) directly affects how contributions from \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) are accumulated, leading to a different outcome for differing values of \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
