  "Problem": "A two-dimensional linear system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) represents a rotation. We examine the effect of the function \\\\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) on the system's behavior over time t, where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\), which also results in a rotational transformation.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(y) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to a vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\), and afterward the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\) without any further intervention, does the trajectory of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) align with that if \\\\( y_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "Both A and B are rotation matrices with the same structural form but possibly different rotation speeds. The composite effect of applying \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and then evolving under \\\\( A \\\\) results in a system undergoing rotations, which is qualitatively the same as evolving under \\\\( A \\\\) alone. The difference lies only in the speed and phase of rotation, not the nature of the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
