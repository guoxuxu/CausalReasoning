  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and C is a real constant. The function undergoes an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iCs}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nAssuming the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T[z] \\\\) and then evolved according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\) from time 0 to T, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) match the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) affects the initial phase and amplitude of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since it integrates over a path affected by \\\\( e^{-iCs} \\\\), the resultant state at any t including T will not match the direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iCz \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
