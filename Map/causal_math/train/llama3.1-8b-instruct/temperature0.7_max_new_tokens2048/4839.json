  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that describes a two-dimensional motion, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with a constant complex matrix \\\\( P \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf an intervention by a function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant complex matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the natural dynamics matrix \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the state of the system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This introduces the effects of another non-trivial transformation, meaning the system's trajectory and final state at time T will depend on \\\\( P \\\\), \\\\( Q \\\\), and \\\\( R \\\\). The composed effect of these transformations profoundly influences the overall state dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
