  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equation set \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\) applied to z(t) for causal inference.\n\nCan we determine whether the alteration by matrix C was implemented solely based on changes observed in the post-intervention Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While differences in the Laplace transform indicate a change, they do not conclusively specify what type of intervention (such as the addition of C) was applied. Various types of interventions could result in similar changes in the Laplace transform, thereby requiring more specific data to identify the intervention precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
