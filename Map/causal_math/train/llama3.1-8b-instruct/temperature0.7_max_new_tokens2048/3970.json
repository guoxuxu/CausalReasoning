  "Problem": "Assume a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We consider the impact of a Fourier transform operation, \\\\(F[\\\\cdot]\\\\), applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\(F[z(T)]\\\\) of the function at time T, can one accurately determine the initial function \\\\(z(0)\\\\) without knowing if any transforms were applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform preserves all frequency information, including amplitudes and phases. Given \\\\(F[z(T)]\\\\) and knowing it evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z\\\\), one can reverse the phase shifts applied over the interval from 0 to T to perfectly reconstruct \\\\(z(0)\\\\), assuming there was no loss of information through any potential transforms initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
