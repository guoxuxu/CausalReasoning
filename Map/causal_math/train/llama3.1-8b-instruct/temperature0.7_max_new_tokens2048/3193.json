  "Problem": "Let's consider a scenario involving a circuit with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and two components: a resistor with resistance R and a capacitor with capacitance C. The input voltage across the circuit can be described by the function \\\\( u(t) = U_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and we are interested in analyzing the output voltage across the capacitor \\\\( v(t) \\\\) using the Laplace transform.\n\nIf the input voltage \\\\( u(t) \\\\) changes frequency from \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\), and no other intervention is done, will the phase shift of the output voltage across the capacitor still be solely determined by the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift of the output voltage depends on the ratio of the angular frequency of the input voltage to the natural frequency of the circuit (i.e., \\\\(\\\\omega/\\\\omega_0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega_0 = 1/(RC)\\\\)). Changing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) changes this ratio, thereby altering the phase shift of the output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
