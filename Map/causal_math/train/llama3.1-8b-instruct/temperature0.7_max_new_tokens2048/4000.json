  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by the Laplace operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s)\\\\), examining the function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and its transformation \\\\\\\\(( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\)). We then intervene by applying a transformation through the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{t}f(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the final function in the Laplace domain after the intervening transformation with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we deduce both the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the exact nature and timing of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While we could theoretically deconvolve the Laplace transform to move backwards through transformations, in practice, ambiguity in decomposition, especially without explicit time points of intervention or additional constraints, makes it troublesome. Identifying the specifics and sequence of interventions based purely on the final transform is highly challenging and often indeterminant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → F(s); F(s) → g(t); g(t) → Laplace transformation; Laplace transformation → f(t); Laplace transformation → intervention timing; intervention timing → nature of intervention"
