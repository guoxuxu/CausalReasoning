  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the iterated integral transformation \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(f(x)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}(\\int_0^t f(u) du) dt\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a complex function. We examine the impact of modifying \\\\(f(x)\\\\) by a transformation \\\\(g(f(x)) = f(x) + ce^{dx}\\\\), where c and d are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) after computing \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g(f(x))) \\\\) and knowing c and d, without knowing whether \\\\(g\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information on the application of \\\\( g \\\\), and knowing only the constants c and d, it's not feasible to reverse engineer \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g(f(x))) \\\\) due to the integrated effects introduced by \\\\( ce^{dx} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
