  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\< T \\\\) an inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be solely dependent on the operator \\\\( iA \\\\) applied in \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) following the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Fourier transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the state from the frequency domain back to the time domain, introducing additional complexity. The subsequent evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) still depends on the transformed state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and so \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not solely depend on \\\\( iA \\\\) but also on the specifics of the transformation states prior to intervention.",
