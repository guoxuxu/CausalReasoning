  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\) is subject to the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0 and then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be affected by the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), existing as an integral over a period from 0 to T, encapsulates a cumulative effect, distinct from a point transformation, contributing additional phase shifts and magnitudes throughout the interval. Hence, the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced inherently by \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
