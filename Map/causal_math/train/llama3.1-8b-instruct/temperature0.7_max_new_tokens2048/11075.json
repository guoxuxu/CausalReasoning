  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend solely on the original evolution without considering the effect of the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform introduces a significant shift from time to frequency domain, altering the trajectory even if the original system was governed by a time-domain function. This dependency means the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent not only on the natural evolution but also on how these transforms interact with each other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
