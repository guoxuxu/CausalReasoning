  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is driven by a voltage source \\\\( V(t) \\\\). The relationship is governed by a linear differential equation involving a convolution with the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) of the circuit. We analyze how the response changes if we modify the signal using a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{V(t)\\\\} = \\\\tilde{V}(s) \\\\), apply a filter defined by a function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and then take the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{ F(s)\\\\tilde{V}(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nGiven the output current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) and knowing that some filtering was applied, can we determine precisely which filters (\\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or both) were used based on the output alone?",
  "Explanation": "Filtering in the frequency domain might produce similar or even practically indistinguishable effects on the output current depending on their characteristics. Thus, knowing the output current alone does not suffice to definitively identify whether \\\\( F(s) \\\\), \\\\( G(s) \\\\), or both were applied, especially without additional information about the phase and amplitude modifications made by these filters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
