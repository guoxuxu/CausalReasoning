  "Problem": "Consider a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) that is governed by the Schrodinger equation with a potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). An integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = \\\\int h(x) \\\\psi(x,t) dx \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a fixed function.\n\nIf \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is computed for an initial wave function at t = 0, and then \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) is evolved over time t under the Schrodinger equation without further application of \\\\( f \\\\), will the computation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at a later time t = T be affected by its initial calculation?",
  "Explanation": "The computation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) at t = 0 does not modify \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\). Thus, the wave function evolves solely based on the dictated dynamics of the Schrodinger equation, independent of the initial calculation of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\). The changes in \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) over time are dictated by the potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and not the initial application of the transformation \\\\( f \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
