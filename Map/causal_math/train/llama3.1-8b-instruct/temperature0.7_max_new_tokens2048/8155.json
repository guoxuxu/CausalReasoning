  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where the current in a circuit is modified through a signal processing function, described by \\\\( I'(t) = L(I(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator characterizing an integral transformation. Here, \\\\( I(t) \\\\) represents the original current signal over time, and we analyze the effects of this transformation over the performance of the circuit.\n\nAssuming an intervention is made at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with a different transformation \\\\( M(I) \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( I'(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 accurately represent the original dynamics of the circuit governed solely by \\\\( I_0 \\\\), unaffected by transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation, \\\\( M \\\\), will further modify the signal in addition to the initial transformation by \\\\( L \\\\). The final state of the signal \\\\( I'(T) \\\\) would be influenced by both transformations, deviating it from the original dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
