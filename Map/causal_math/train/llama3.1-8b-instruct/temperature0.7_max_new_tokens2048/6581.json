  "Problem": "Consider a system based on the function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real scalar. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix, on the variable \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied at x = 0, leading to \\\\( z(0) = Bz_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state, and then allowed to evolve under the function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = X be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to x = X under \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz_0 \\\\) changes the starting point from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Bz_0 \\\\), which then evolves according to \\\\( e^{Ax}Bz_0 \\\\). Since matrix exponentiation and multiplication are not necessarily commutative, \\\\( e^{Ax}Bz_0 \\\\) might not equal \\\\( Be^{Ax}z_0 \\\\), leading to a different state at x = X.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
