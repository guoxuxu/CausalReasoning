  "Problem": "In a control system, consider a scalar linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p z \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a constant parameter. The function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\sin(qz) \\\\) is applied, transforming the state, where \\\\( q \\\\) is another constant parameter.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and without additional context?",
  "Explanation": "The interaction of non-linear transformations like sine and the square function, along with the parameter-driven linear growth term, generates a complexity that obscures the specific sequence or type of transformations applied. Multiple transformation pathways could result in the same final state, making it impossible to definitively unravel the interventions used based on the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
