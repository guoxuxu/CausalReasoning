  "Problem": "Let's consider a functional space where we deal with the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace Transform. We analyze the causality and effect relations within signals \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and their Laplace Transforms \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\).\n\nIf an extra filtering process defined by another Laplace Transformable function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( X_{new}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t) * x(t)) \\\\), does the result depend only on the original \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and not on the particular choice of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transformed signal \\\\( X_{new}(s) \\\\) is a product of the original Laplace Transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the transform of the filter \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\), i.e., \\\\( X_{new}(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\). Hence, it critically depends on the choice of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and its properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
