  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\), where K is a matrix. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\), where L is a diagonal matrix and S is an invertible matrix, over the time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T be identical to what would result if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) means that the starting point of the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\) is fundamentally altered by the application of \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Lt}S \\\\), which typically reshapes the trajectory based on L and S in relation to K, therefore leading to a different result at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
