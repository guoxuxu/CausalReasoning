  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(t) \\\\) has a certain frequency spectrum determined by \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), and then is allowed to evolve naturally according to its physical laws without further intervention, will the Fourier Transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) include new frequency components?",
  "Explanation": "If the system evolves naturally without external input or changes, the frequency components determined at any later time will remain consistent with the initial intrinsic frequencies set by \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) unless there are internal nonlinearities or additional forces influencing the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
