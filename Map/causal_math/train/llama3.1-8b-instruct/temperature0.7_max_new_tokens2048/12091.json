  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space where functions are defined as \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real number. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on these functions across variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nCan the original configuration of \\\\( A \\\\) in \\\\( h(x) \\\\), any intervention \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or the absence thereof be precisely identified from the Laplace transform output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\), or identifying the particular function \\\\( g \\\\) used, based on the Laplace transform output alone is impractical without additional constraints or information. The transformation output could potentially result from various configurations of \\\\( A \\\\) and different forms of interventions overlapping in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
