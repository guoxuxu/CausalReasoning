  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) within a domain. We explore the influence of boundary conditions altering the function \\\\(u\\\\) through an integral transformation \\\\(T[u] = \\\\int_D k(x,y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\(k(x, y)\\\\) is a kernel modifying \\\\(u\\\\) along the boundary \\\\(D\\\\).\n\nSuppose another transformation, \\\\(S[u] = \\\\int_D m(x,y) u(y) dy\\\\) (where \\\\(m(x, y)\\\\) is another kernel), is applied at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state of \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T > t_1\\\\) be independent of initial transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) will be influenced by both transformations since each modifies the boundary conditions in potentially non-overlapping ways, affecting the overall solutions of the Laplace equation across the domain. The presence of multiple transformations complicates the trajectories and cannot be disregarded.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
