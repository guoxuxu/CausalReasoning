  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) with a thermal diffusivity constant k. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied as a functional alteration, impacting the system's response to thermal inputs.\n\nKnowing the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we ascertain precisely which transformations were applied (either Fourier, Laplace, or both) throughout the timeline, considering only the observed ending state?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects and the transformations altering the behavior of the heat equation in different operational bases (frequency and complex plane for Fourier and Laplace, respectively), it is impossible to decisively identify which transformations were applied only from the endpoint observation. Such transformations can equivalently modify the trajectory, leading to indistinguishable end states.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
