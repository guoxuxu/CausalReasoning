  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series, described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = E(t) \\\\), where \\\\( q(t) \\\\) is the charge and \\\\( E(t) \\\\) is an external voltage source. The relationship to be studied involves examining the behavior of this RLC circuit under the transformation of an applied impulse response function denoted as \\\\( F(t) = e^{-st} \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original charge \\\\( q(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( q(T) \\\\), without knowing whether an impulse response \\\\( F(t) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( F(t) \\\\), the transformation can render the initial condition \\\\( q(0) \\\\) untraceable by solely observing \\\\( q(T) \\\\). The exponential factor in \\\\( F(t) \\\\) may affect the state in a non-reversible manner without additional data or constraints on the system's dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
