  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts respectively, which are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We further analyze the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on matrices C and D as well as A and B. The transformations have cumulative effects that intertwine dynamically, affecting the trajectory and final state of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
