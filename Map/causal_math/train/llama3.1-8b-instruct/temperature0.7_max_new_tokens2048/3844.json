  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where C is a complex constant, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the consequences of an integral transformation on this system, denoted by \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda (t-\\\\tau)} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a decay factor.\n\nKnowing the system reaches a specific endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely the type and time of interventions applied (whether \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\), \\\\(T_{\\\\mu}[z](t)\\\\), or both)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), multiple scenarios involving different applications of \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\) and \\\\(T_{\\\\mu}[z](t)\\\\), potentially at different times, could lead to the same final state due to the linearity and complexity in decay integration, leading to an inconclusive identification of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
