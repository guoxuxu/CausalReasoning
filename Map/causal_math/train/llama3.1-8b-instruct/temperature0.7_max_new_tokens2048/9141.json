  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is calculated initially at t = 0 and the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved to t = T under the given differential equation without any further transformation, does \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the differential equation is inherent and depends solely on the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), regardless of the initial computation of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The integral transformation does not alter the differential equation itself but merely computes a quantity based on \\\\( z \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
