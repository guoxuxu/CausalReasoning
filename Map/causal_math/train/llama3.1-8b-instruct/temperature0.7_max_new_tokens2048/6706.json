  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial form of \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) integrates effects cumulatively and involves an exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), which can obscure unique features of the original function, particularly the linear and oscillatory components. The transformation masks specific details making it impossible to reconstruct the original function uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
