  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a vector space described by a matrix 𝐌. An integral transformation \\\\( T[𝐱](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}𝐌𝐱(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where 𝐱(t) is a vector function affected over time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the output of the Laplace transform \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\( 𝐱_0 \\\\) without knowing if it was transformed by 𝐌?",
  "Explanation": "Laplace transform encodes the whole function \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\), not just the initial state, and does not typically allow for the precise inversion to the exact initial conditions without prior knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( 𝐌𝐱_0 \\\\) was applied. Ambiguities arise due to potential variations in \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) and its effect on \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
