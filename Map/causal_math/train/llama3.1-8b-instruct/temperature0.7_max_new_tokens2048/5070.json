  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the impact of the linear operator \\\\( L \\{z\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform, on this function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z\\}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "From the transformed function \\\\( L\\{z\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), we can uniquely solve for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) since it directly corresponds to the imaginary part of the pole of the Laplace transform. Hence, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can be uniquely identified.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
