  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + Lz = 0\\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We study the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[z(t)](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), on a function z(t) in this context.\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[z](s)\\\\) after interventions, can we precisely determine both the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and the nature of any control functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) used, only from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[z](s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and complexity of the inverse Laplace transform in conjunction with added control functions, multiple plausible initial conditions and control functions can yield the same transformed function. This overlap in potential solutions introduces inherent ambiguity, making it impossible to uniquely identify the original conditions and interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
