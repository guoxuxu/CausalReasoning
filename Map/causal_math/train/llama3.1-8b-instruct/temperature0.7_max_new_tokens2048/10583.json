  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system which is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a linear operator. An external control is modeled by multipling the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) by a matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\), where M is a time-independent matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nIf another intervention \\\\(e^{Nt}x(t)\\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will depend on all three matrices D, M, and N. The new intervention with \\\\(e^{Nt} \\\\) further diverges the system’s evolution path from what it would be under the effect of D alone, reflecting the combined influences of these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
