  "Problem": "Consider the impact of varying the counterpart of a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant real number, on the integral transform \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\\\). We investigate how changes in \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) affect the outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nIf the parameter \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is increased, without any other intervention to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) or its environment, will the peak of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) shift accordingly to higher frequencies?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) directly alters the frequency component in \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) which leads to a corresponding shift in the peak of \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) towards higher frequencies. This is due to the inherent properties of the Fourier transform where the frequency domain representation directly correlates to the frequency components present in the time-domain function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
