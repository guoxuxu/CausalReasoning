  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent variables described by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constant matrices A, B, C, and D. We investigate the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{st} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine with certainty what transforms (either \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both) were applied at earlier times, solely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of applications of the transforms \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) at different times can lead to the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The overlap in potential effects due to the convolution-like nature of the transforms and their dependence on initial conditions and parameters makes it impossible to uniquely identify the applied transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
