  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a continuous function. The transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{at} \\\\) is explored, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an adjustment \\\\( h(t) = g(t) e^{ct} \\\\) is applied at a certain point where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, does \\\\( H(s) \\\\) equal \\\\( F(s - a - c) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention, \\\\( h(t) = g(t) e^{ct} = f(t) e^{at} e^{ct} = f(t) e^{(a+c)t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), denoted \\\\( H(s) \\\\), is \\\\( F(s - a - c) \\\\) by applying the shift property successively. Hence, every adjustment changes the domain in the Laplace space consistently by the respective additive constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
