  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) in a material is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T\\\\), where \\\\(k > 0\\\\) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material. We examine the effect of an external heating function \\\\( h(t) = H e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant heat input.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an additional cooling function \\\\( c(t_1) = -Ce^{-kt} \\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant) is applied to the system, does the final temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\) depend solely on the initial thermal parameter \\\\(k\\\\) and not on \\\\(H\\\\) or \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\) is affected by both the heating and cooling interventions. The constants \\\\(H\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), representing the intensity of heating and cooling, significantly influence the final state at time T, alongside the decay rate controlled by \\\\(k\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
