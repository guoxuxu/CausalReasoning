  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\), involving a complex matrix F, is applied at different instances.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T evolve identically as it would without the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by scaling and rotating the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, which significantly alters the trajectory under the given system dynamics, leading to a potentially different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
