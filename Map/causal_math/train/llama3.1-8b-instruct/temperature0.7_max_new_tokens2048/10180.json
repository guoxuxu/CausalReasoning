  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of functions over complex domains and examine the impact of an integral transformation. Let \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) be defined on the complex plane minus the origin z = 0 and let an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_{C} f(z) dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin.\n\nKnowing that the result of the transformed integral \\\\( T(fg) \\\\) is zero after applying the regularization function g(z), can we determine that the original function had a singularity?",
  "Explanation": "The result of zero in the integrated value of \\\\( fg(z) = 1 \\\\) could occur irrespective of whether f(z) had a singularity or not before the intervention by g(z). The regularization by multiplying with z suppresses the original singularity (if any), making it impossible to infer the nature of f(z) directly from the resultant integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
