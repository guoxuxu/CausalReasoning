  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equation set \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\) applied to z(t) for causal inference.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we uniquely infer the original matrices A and B used in the differential equations for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Though the Laplace transform provides information about the system, it generally cannot uniquely determine A and B without additional data such as initial conditions or specific system properties. The information lost in transformation to the frequency domain complicates the reversion to the time-domain matrices uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
