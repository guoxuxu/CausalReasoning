  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions that describe oscillations in a physical system modeled by the second order differential equation \\( \\\\ddot{z} + \\omega^2 z = 0 \\). The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) at some later time \\( T \\), can we uniquely determine the exact initial conditions \\( u(0) \\) and \\( v(0) \\) without additional information about the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides information integrating over the entire history of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), and while it encapsulates data about initial conditions, it cannot disentangle those specifics if the functional form of \\( z(t) \\) or any additional initial phase shifts are unknown. Multiple sets of initial conditions may result in the same Laplace transform, particularly without knowing the specific values of \\( \\omega \\) or how \\( z(t) \\) was altered initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
