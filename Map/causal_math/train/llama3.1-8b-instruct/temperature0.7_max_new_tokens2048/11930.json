  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane, \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We are interested in understanding how the integral transforms, specifically the Laplace transform, affect this function and its causal inference.\n\nIf we modify \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = f(z) + cos(z) \\\\) and then apply the Laplace transform, will the resulting function's transform be a direct additive result of the Laplace transforms of \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is linear, meaning that the transform of a sum of functions is the sum of their transforms. Thus, the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will indeed be the sum of the transforms of \\\\( e^z \\\\) and \\\\( cos(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → f(z); f(z) → g(z); g(z) → Laplace_transform(g(z)); Laplace_transform(g(z)) → Laplace_transform(e^z) + Laplace_transform(cos(z)); Laplace_transform(e^z) → Laplace_transform(cos(z)); Laplace_transform(cos(z)) → Laplace_transform(e^z) + Laplace_transform(cos(z)); z → Laplace_transform(e^z); z → Laplace_transform(cos(z)); e^z → Laplace_transform(e^z); cos(z) → Laplace_transform(cos(z))"
