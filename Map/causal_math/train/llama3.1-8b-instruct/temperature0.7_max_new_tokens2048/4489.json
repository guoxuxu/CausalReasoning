  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nDoes applying the time-scaling operation \\(g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t)\\) to a function and then computing its Laplace Transform change the result compared to directly computing the transform of \\(f(t)\\) under normal conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The time-scaling operation modifies the function which results in a different Laplace Transform, specifically \\( L(g)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}L(f)(\\\\frac{s}{\\\\alpha}) \\). This change clearly indicates that the outputs will not be the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "time_scaling → f(αt); α → g(t); g(t) → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → L(f); L(f) → L(g); L(g) → L(f(αt); α → L(f(αt); f → L(f); L(f) → L(g); L(g) → result; f(αt) → L(f(αt))"
