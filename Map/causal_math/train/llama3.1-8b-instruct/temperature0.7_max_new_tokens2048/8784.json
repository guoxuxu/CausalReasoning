  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Let's analyze the effect of applying the Laplace transform with respect to time on the equation, transforming the wave equation into the s-domain.\n\nGiven the final s-domain solution \\\\( U(s, x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_2 \\\\), is it possible to precisely infer both the original transform applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and any interventions applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities of Laplace transforms and possible interactions (or dependencies) between transformed initial conditions and mid-process interventions, it is generally infeasible to uniquely untangle and correctly deduce both the original transformation and the precise nature of any intermediate interventions solely from the final s-domain outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
