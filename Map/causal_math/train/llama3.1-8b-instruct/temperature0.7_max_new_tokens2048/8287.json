  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), with \\\\( F(z) = Az + C \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and C is a constant vector. We analyze the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and its inverse \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) applied to this system over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying the inverse Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) is performed at time \\\\( T_1 \\\\), will the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > \\\\( T_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and not on the initial application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) attempts to revert the system back to its time-domain state. However, the transition history affected by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) influences the system’s behavior. Consequently, both transformations impact the state at time T, meaning dependencies extend beyond just \\\\( F(z) \\\\) to include effects and modifications from these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
