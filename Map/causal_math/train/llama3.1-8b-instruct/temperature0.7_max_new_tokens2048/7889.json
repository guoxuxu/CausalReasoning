  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the system's response under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), applied over a time interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is computed on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves from an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) for a duration T without any intervention, will the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) unequivocally reflect the influence of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) inherently includes contributions from both the homogeneous solution influenced by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and the particular solution introduced by \\\\( k \\\\). Thus, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) captures and reflects the effect of \\\\( k \\\\) integrally across the interval, factoring in both the resonant and forced components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
