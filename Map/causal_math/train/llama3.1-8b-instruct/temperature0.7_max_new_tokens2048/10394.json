  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\( x_N \\\\) at step N, can we infer the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( B \\\\) introduces an ambiguity. Without knowing whether \\\\( B \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x_N \\\\) as both \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( B x_0 \\\\) could potentially lead to observed states, depending upon their respective evolutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
