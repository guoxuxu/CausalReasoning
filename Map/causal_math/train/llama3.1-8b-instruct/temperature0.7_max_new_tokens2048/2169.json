  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to examine the system behavior.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the system dynamics without further interventions, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T resemble the trajectory if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under the standard differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial setup by integrating the function over time with exponential weighting, which changes the trajectory fundamentally. The original dynamics governed solely by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) will not catch these modifications independently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
