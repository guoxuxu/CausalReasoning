  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function, transforming it into \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\).\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and the transformed function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) evolves under its own defining equation without further transformation, will the inverse Laplace transform at some later point s = S lead back to the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T assuming no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are inverse operations. Assuming the system is described entirely by \\\\(M\\\\) and no other interventions alter its state, the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) can be fully recovered from \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at any later point by applying the inverse Laplace transform, hence retaining the original function form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
