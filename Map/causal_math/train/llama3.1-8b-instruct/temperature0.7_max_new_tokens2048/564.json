  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(s-t)A}h(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent function. The transformation \\\\(g(z) = Cz + D\\\\int_0^T z(s) ds\\\\) is applied at time T, where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nKnowing the transformed output at time T, can we ascertain with certainty whether an intervention was applied or deduce the specific timing and nature of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity of the transformations involving both current and integrated past states, and the nontrivial effects of matrix transformations on these, means that different combinations of interventions and original functions \\\\(h(t)\\\\) could yield equivalent results at \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making precise identification of the history and interventions unfeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(t) → z(t); A → z(t); C → g(z); D → g(z); D → ∫_0^T z(s) ds; ∫_0^T z(s) ds → g(z); z(T) → g(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The value of h(t) directly influences z(t), the matrix A influences z(t), the matrix C influences g(z), and the matrix D influences both g(z) and the integral of z(s) from 0 to T. The integral of z(s) from 0 to T also influences g(z), and z(T) directly influences g(z)."
