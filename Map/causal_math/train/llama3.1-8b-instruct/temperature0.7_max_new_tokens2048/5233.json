  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a linear transformation given by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\ c & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) applied to the components \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if the initial conditions \\\\( (x_0, y_0) \\\\) had been directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( M \\\\) alters the initial conditions, which in turn changes the evolution of the system. Since the system's behavior is linearly dependent on the initial conditions and the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ from the trajectory starting from untransformed initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
