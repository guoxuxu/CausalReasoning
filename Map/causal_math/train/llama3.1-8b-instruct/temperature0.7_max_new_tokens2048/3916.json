  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the Hamiltonian function \\\\( H(p, q) = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are the momentum and position of the particle, and \\\\( V(q) \\\\) is the potential energy as a function of position. We explore the effect of a canonical transformation \\\\( (P, Q) = \\\\phi(p, q) \\\\) on the system's dynamics.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( (P(T), Q(T)) \\\\) observed at t = T, can we determine with certainty the specific nature of any interventions (such as changes in \\\\( V(q) \\\\)), merely by using the information of the transformed Hamiltonian \\\\( K(P, Q) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific nature of interventions like modifications in \\\\( V(q) \\\\) from the final transformed state \\\\( (P(T), Q(T)) \\\\) alone is not feasible, as multiple different interventions (or combinations thereof) could lead to identical or indistinguishable outcomes in the transformed state, particularly without explicit knowledge of the intervening modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
