  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\) by the operator \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tA} f(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The transformation is used to analyze the effect of the modified function over the interval [0, x].\n\nKnowing the value of the transformed function \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\) for some x, can the exact point and nature of an intervention on \\\\( f \\\\) be determined?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation provided by \\\\( T \\\\) integrates over the modified areas of function \\\\( f \\\\), smoothing out specific information about the point and extent of interventions. Multiple different interventions could result in the same integral value, making it impossible to pinpoint the nature and location of the intervention solely based on \\\\( T[f](x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x → T[f](x); f(t) → T[f](x); A → T[f](x); T[f](x) → exact point of intervention; T[f](x) → nature of intervention"
