  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we determine the exact form of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\) solely based on the function observed at some \\\\( z = Z \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the function at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) post-transformation, and without information about \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\), there are countless possible combinations of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) that could yield the observed output. This uncertainty arises because the initial form and the transformation's frequency heavily influence the resulting function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
