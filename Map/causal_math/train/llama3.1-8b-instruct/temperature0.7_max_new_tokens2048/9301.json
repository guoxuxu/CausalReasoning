  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is computed for a function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = \\infty \\), does this transformation preserve the frequency \\( \\omega \\) in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\( g(z) \\), specifically the Laplace transform in this context, converts the function into a frequency domain representation. However, the presence of \\( s \\) alters the frequency components, meaning \\( \\omega \\) is represented differently in the transform's output compared to the original domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
