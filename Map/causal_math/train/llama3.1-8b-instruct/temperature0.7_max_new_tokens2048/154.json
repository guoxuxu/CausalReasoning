  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^2 \\\\) defined over the complex numbers, and let \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\\\) be an integral transformation. Investigate the implications of this setup where \\\\( z \\\\) evolves as a complex function.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( z \\\\) without additional information about any transformation like addition of \\\\( i \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) involves an exponential integral that is not straightforward to invert and is highly sensitive to the input \\\\( z \\\\), retrieving \\\\( z \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without knowledge of any transformation applied to \\\\( z \\\\) beforehand is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
