  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + i y(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is examined under this transformation over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely by observing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interaction of exponential transformations in the complex plane, which can involve scaling, rotation, and more, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not sufficently reveal whether specific transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or a combination of both, were applied. Different initial conditions and transformations can yield the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
