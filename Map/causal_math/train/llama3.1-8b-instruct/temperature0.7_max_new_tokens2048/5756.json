  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a periodic function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze how different types of interventions (applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) depending on a parameter matrix \\\\( P \\\\)) affect the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) post-intervention, can we conclusively state which matrix \\\\( P \\\\) was applied to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple matrices \\\\( P \\\\) could potentially yield the same modified function characteristics (altered amplitude and phase), especially without explicit knowledge of the original function's characteristics and the exact nature of the intervention. The result might match for different matrices due to their effect on amplitude and phase, making it impossible to uniquely identify the matrix \\\\( P \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
