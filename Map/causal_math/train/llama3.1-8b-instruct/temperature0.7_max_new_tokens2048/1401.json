  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a matrix \\( M \\) is applied to vector \\( x \\) creating \\( y = Mx \\). An integral operation \\( I(f(x)) = \\int_0^T f(x(t)) dt \\) is performed to analyze the transformed vector \\( y \\) over a period \\( T \\), where \\( f(x(t)) \\) is a function dependent on vector \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\).\n\nIf the matrix \\( M \\) is applied to vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then \\( y \\) evolves under \\( I(f(x)) \\) without further matrix applications, will \\( y(T) \\) be only dependent on \\( M \\) and \\( f(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further transformations are applied and the evolution is guided by the initial matrix transformation \\( Mx_0 \\) and the integration of \\( f(x) \\) over \\( T \\), \\( y(T) \\)'s dependency is strictly on \\( M \\) and \\( f(x) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
