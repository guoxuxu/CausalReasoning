  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) applied over time t, with C being another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) at t = 0 modifies both x and y components of z, thus altering the trajectory from the initial conditions. Since C can affect each component differently, this typically leads to a distinct endpoint at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
