  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra scenario where the action of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\) on a vector space is modified by a function \\\\( g(v) = V^{-1}e^{Dt}Vv \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix, \\\\(V\\\\) is the matrix representing a basis transformation, and \\\\(v\\\\) is an arbitrary vector in the space.\n\nBy observing the resultant vector at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) after the transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\) then \\\\( L \\\\), can we ascertain precisely the initial vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(v) \\\\) or its parameters were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the specific diagonal matrix \\\\(D\\\\) and basis transformation matrix \\\\(V\\\\) used in \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is crucial. Without this, recovering the exact initial vector \\\\( v_0 \\\\) or determining whether \\\\( g(v) \\\\) was applied is indeterminate, because these influence how the vector space was altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
