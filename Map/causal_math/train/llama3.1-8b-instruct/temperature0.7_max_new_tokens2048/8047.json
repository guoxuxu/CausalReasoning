  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation on the state vector described by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new control \\\\( v = Cu \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, where C is another constant matrix, and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) has been applied, will the new state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be independent of C?",
  "Explanation": "The new control input modifies the system's input from \\\\( Bu \\\\) to \\\\( BCu \\\\), thus the matrix C will influence the system's dynamics and consequently the state at time T. The system's response is a combination of past states (influenced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)) and the new control dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
