  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) that maps complex numbers to other complex numbers defined by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We analyze the behavior of this function under different transformations and the inversion through the integral transformation \\\\( W(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-uz} w(z) \\\\, dz \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( W(u) \\\\) from the transformed complex function, can we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without intervention, considering the transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( W(u) \\\\) loses certain information about the specific \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the integral's averaging effect and the exponential nature of \\\\( w(z) \\\\). Multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) may result in the same transformed output, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
