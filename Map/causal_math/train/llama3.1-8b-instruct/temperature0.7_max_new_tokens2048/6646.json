  "Problem": "Investigate the interplay between two functions, \\\\( p(z) = z^2 + 1 \\\\) and \\\\( q(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, and their effects within the integral transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed outcome \\\\( I[p(z)] \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( p(z) \\\\) used, if it was applied before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( I[f(z)] \\\\) might significantly modify certain characteristics of \\\\( p(z) \\\\), and multiple functions could yield similar outcomes under this transformation. Thus, reconstructing \\\\( p(z) \\\\) from \\\\( I[p(z)] \\\\) is not straightforward without additional constraints or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
