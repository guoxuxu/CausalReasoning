  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the vector field is governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L \\{ v(t) \\} = sV(s) - v(0) \\), with \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) where A is a constant matrix. We'll examine the effects of perturbing this system with another transform \\( f(v) = e^{Bt}v \\) where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\( v(T) \\) resulting from evolution under \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\), can we trace back to determine the original vector \\( v_0 \\) without knowing whether \\( f(v) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lack of information about the application of \\( f(v) \\), which includes the transformation \\( e^{Bt} \\), obscures the ability to determine \\( v_0 \\) uniquely. The transformation could have altered the initial state in a way that isn't directly reversible especially if B modifies the dynamics non-trivially relative to A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
