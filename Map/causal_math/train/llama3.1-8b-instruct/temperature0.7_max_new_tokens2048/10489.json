  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system dynamics are further influenced by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) without further intervention, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) will alter the initial system state to \\\\( z_0^m \\\\). As \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) is affected by the initial conditions, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) = e^{kmT}z_0^m \\\\) will not match the state obtained by direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without transformation, which would have been \\\\( e^{kT}z_0 \\\\). The exponentiation changes the trajectory uniquely depending on the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
