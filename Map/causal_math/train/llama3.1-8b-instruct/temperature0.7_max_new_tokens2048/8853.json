  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the effects of applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) where C is a constant.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed from t = 0 to t = T, and then the system continues to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) computes a modified trajectory separately and does not influence the dynamics of the underlying system, which continue to evolve according to their respective differential equations. Thus, the effect of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is independent from the ongoing evolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
