  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), it's impossible to trace back reliably as the transformation \\( e^{Ct} \\) could have scaled the initial state in a complex manner, and this scaled state's evolution under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) could correspond to multiple possible initial conditions \\( z_0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
