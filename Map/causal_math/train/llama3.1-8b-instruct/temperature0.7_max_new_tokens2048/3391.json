  "Problem": "Analyzing a time-dependent quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian of the system. We explore the scenario where an operation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), with \\\\( H' \\\\) being another Hamiltonian, is applied to the system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( V(t) = e^{-iH''t} \\\\) (where \\\\( H'' \\\\) is a third Hamiltonian) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( H \\\\) and not on \\\\( H' \\\\) or \\\\( H'' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( V(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics into the system's evolution, affecting the final quantum state. The quantum state's development becomes dependent on the dynamics introduced by both \\\\( H' \\\\) and \\\\( H'' \\\\), along with the original \\\\( H \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
