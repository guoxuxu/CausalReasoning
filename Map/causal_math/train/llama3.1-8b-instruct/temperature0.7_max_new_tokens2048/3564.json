  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely resolve all actions (including any spatial transformations) applied to the system, from its initial state to time \\\\( T \\\\), by knowing only the final distribution?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the thermal diffusion properties being largely smoothing and potentially isotropic, it's particularly challenging to back-calculate any applied spatial transformations from the temperature distribution alone at time \\\\( T \\\\). The transformations could have overlapping effects, enhancing the complexity of unambiguous determination.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
