  "Problem": "Consider the fluid dynamics described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Let \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid, where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We investigate the behavior of the fluid under a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\times (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), which represents the curl of the velocity field.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the curl transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the curl transformation, it is impossible to accurately trace back to the exact original state \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0 \\\\), as the transformation could have altered significant characteristics of the velocity field, such as introducing or modifying the vorticity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
