  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) (also transformable) is added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant Laplace transform \\\\( W(s) \\\\) only depend on the transforms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and not on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( w(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) results in a new function whose Laplace transform, \\\\( W(s) \\\\), will be the sum of the individual transforms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( W(s) \\\\) will depend on both the components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
