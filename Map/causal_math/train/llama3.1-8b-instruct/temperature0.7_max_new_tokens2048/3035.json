  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z \\\\mapsto z + a \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real positive number, and then \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is computed, will the result always be bounded?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z \\\\) by adding a positive real constant \\\\( a \\\\) ensures the real part of \\\\( z \\\\) is positive or increases, leading the exponential function \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) to decay more strongly, ensuring the integral is always bounded.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
