  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = A x + B u\\\\), with A being the system matrix and B the input matrix. The input \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of time and defined by an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) x(s) ds \\\\), where K is a kernel matrix function.\n\nIf the kernel matrix function \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is applied to influence the input \\\\( u \\\\) from time t = 0 onward, will the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T be identical to a scenario where \\\\( K(s) \\\\) was a zero matrix?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( K(s) \\\\) influences the input \\\\( u \\\\), which in turn affects the dynamic behavior of the system. A non-zero \\\\( K(s) \\\\) modifies the state trajectory compared to the zero matrix, resulting in a different \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel matrix function K(s) indirectly influences the state vector x(t) at time T, because K(s) affects the input u, which in turn affects the state vector x(t), and x(t) affects the input u, creating a feedback loop."
