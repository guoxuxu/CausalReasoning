  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem associated with the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space. The operator is defined by the differential equation \\\\(L[u] = -y'' + q(x)y \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(y(0) = y(1) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is a potential function.\n\nCan we determine which potential function, either \\\\(q(x)\\\\) or \\\\(p(x)\\\\), was originally part of the system by examining the modified eigenvalues after intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The eigenvalues resulting from the combination of potentials do not uniquely identify which potential was initially present. The eigenvalues are influenced by both, and their resulting spectrum cannot reliably distinguish between the potentials' pre-intervention origins.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
