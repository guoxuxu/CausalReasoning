  "Problem": "Consider a controlled dynamical system where the input-output relationship is governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{tA}x(t) \\), with \\( x(t) \\) representing the system state at time \\( t \\) and \\( A \\) a complex constant matrix. We analyze the effect of transforming the system state via a function \\( g(x) = D x \\), where \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\( z(T) = e^{TA}x(T) \\) for some \\( T \\), can we ascertain the initial condition \\( x(0) \\) without knowing whether it was transformed by \\( g(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The exact effect of \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) on \\( x(0) \\) influences the system's trajectory in such a way that knowing just \\( z(T) \\) provides insufficient information to uniquely recover \\( x(0) \\) without additional data about the application or non-application of \\( g(x) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
