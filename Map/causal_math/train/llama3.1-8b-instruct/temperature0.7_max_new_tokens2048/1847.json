  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf at a given time \\\\(t_2\\\\), an intervention involving another transformation \\\\(h(z) = Se^{Nt}z\\\\) (where \\\\(S\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices) is enacted, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_2 be solely determined by \\\\(D\\\\), and not by \\\\(K\\\\) or \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(S\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an additional transformation as an intervention introduces new variables. The resulting state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) becomes influenced by the compounded effects of \\\\(K\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), and \\\\(N\\\\) alongside \\\\(D\\\\), each contributing to the trajectory and the ultimate position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
