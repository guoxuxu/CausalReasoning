  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), where \\\\(w(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) over a variable t, with z as a complex variable. The function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed via another function \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\). Analyze the impact of transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) on the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\).\n\nIf after applying the transformation \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\), a function modifier \\\\(h(t) = t f(t) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the new function \\\\(w_{new}(z)\\\\) be of the form \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^3 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with the function \\\\(h(t)=t f(t)\\\\) after the application of \\\\(g(t)\\\\) results in a combined effect where the term \\\\(t^2\\\\) from \\\\(g(t)\\\\) will multiply with \\\\(t\\\\) from \\\\(h(t)\\\\), effectively transforming the integrand to \\\\(t^3 e^{zt}f(t)\\\\). Therefore, the integral now becomes \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^3 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
