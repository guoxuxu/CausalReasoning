  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\) where \\(M\\) is also a diagonalizable matrix and \\(S\\) is the matrix that diagonalizes \\(D\\).\n\nAssuming that at an intermediate time \\( t_1 \\), the additional transformation \\( k(x) = e^{Nt}x \\) (where \\(N\\) is another diagonalizable matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( M \\) or \\( N \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential application of transformations \\( h(x) \\) and \\( k(x) \\) contributes additional dynamics through \\( e^{Mt} \\) and \\( e^{Nt} \\). The final state \\( x(T) \\) becomes influenced by \\( M \\), \\( N \\) as well as \\( D \\), affecting the evolution and leading to a state that does not solely reflect the action of \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
