  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\) represents the transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The impact of a linear operator \\\\( A \\\\) acting on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(t) = A f(t) \\\\) is being analyzed, where the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to determine exactly which operators (whether \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), or both) acted on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to achieve \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by only examining the result in the s-domain?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), it is challenging to precisely backtrack to identify whether \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), or both were used, as multiple combinations of operators can lead to the same s-domain result due to the complexities and non-uniqueness of transforming operations in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
