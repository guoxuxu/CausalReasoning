  "Problem": "Consider the response space of a signal processing system, modeled by the integral transform \\( Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\), known as the Laplace transform. We explore the effect of modifying the input signal \\( x(t) \\) by a function \\( f(x) = e^{At}x(t) \\), where A is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\( x_0(t) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( Y(s) \\) at s = S without knowing whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied, deducing \\( x_0(t) \\) from \\( Y(s) \\) is not possible because the transform could have been altered by an unknown exponential scaling \\( e^{At} \\), which modifies the spectrum in a way that obscures \\( x_0(t) \\)'s original form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
