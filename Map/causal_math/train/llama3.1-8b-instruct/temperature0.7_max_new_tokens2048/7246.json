  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\), applied over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty regarding the application of transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\), there exists ambiguity in reconstructing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) = Ce^{DT}x(T) \\\\). The possible modification of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) by \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) introduces multiple potential original vectors that could result in the same observed outcome at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
