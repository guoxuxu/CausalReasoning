  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), representing a Laplace transform of a time-domain function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). We explore how applying an integral transformation and its inverse affects our ability to infer causal relationships in the transformed domain.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes the transformation to become \\\\( z(s) \\\\) through the Laplace transformation, and then \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is directly used without further transformation, will the inverse Laplace transform yield the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse form a bijective pair for functions meeting certain reasonable conditions (e.g., piecewise continuity and exponential boundedness), ensuring that the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed from its image \\\\( z(s) \\\\) under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
