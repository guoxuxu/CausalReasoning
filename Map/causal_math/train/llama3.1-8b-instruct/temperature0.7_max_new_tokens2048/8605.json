  "Problem": "Consider a quantum system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. We examine changes due to the operation of the unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), where \\\\( H' \\\\) is another Hamiltonian.\n\nIf \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( U(0)\\\\psi_0 = \\\\psi_0 \\\\), but as t increases, the effect of the differing Hamiltonian \\\\( H' \\\\) alters the evolution trajectory of \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), leading to a state at time T that is generally different from just the evolution under H alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
