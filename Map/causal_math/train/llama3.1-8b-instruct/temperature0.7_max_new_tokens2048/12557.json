  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{L}u\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a function of both space and time, and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), on the system and querying causality with and without intervention.\n\nObserving the Fourier transformed system state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(t, k)\\\\) at time t, can one uniquely determine the initial Fourier-transformed state \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(0, k)\\\\) assuming no knowledge of intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and time-invariant nature of the operator \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) in the Fourier domain, knowing the state at any time allows the unique determination of the initial conditions in the transformed \\\\(k\\\\)-space by reverse applying the exponential solution of the transformed differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
