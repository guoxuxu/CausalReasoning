  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation in a vector space governed by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We are considering the impact of applying another linear operator transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = Mx \\\\) at time t=0, where \\\\( M \\\\) is also a linear operator.\n\nIf partway at time t = t1, an intervention via a transformation \\\\( G(x) = Nx \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another linear operator) is applied, does the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t1 depend exclusively on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Any sequence of transformations significantly impacts the trajectory and the final state of the system. Applying \\\\( G(x) = Nx \\\\) introduces a modification at t1, changing the state from whatever it was at t1 to something new, and thus, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and particularly how they interact with \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
