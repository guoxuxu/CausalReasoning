  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely exclusively on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention involving \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) influenced by not just \\\\( P \\\\), but also \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\). The exponential transformations can adjust the system’s path and the ultimate position in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
