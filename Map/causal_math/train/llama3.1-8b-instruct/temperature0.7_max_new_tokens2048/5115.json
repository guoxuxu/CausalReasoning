  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex domain \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. We investigate the effect of the complex integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{U}(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{kt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( k \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the final transformed output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\) depend solely on the original transform parameters and not on the new transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{U} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) interferes with the original transformation process, influencing the entire computation and final output of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\). Therefore, the final result depends not only on \\\\( s \\\\) but also on \\\\( k \\\\) and the interplay between their respective effects over the integral period.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
