  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a complex plane, described by the relation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant complex number, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Consider the effect spatially shifting this function using another transformation \\\\( h(z) = z + Ce^{Bt} \\\\), where B and C are constant complex numbers.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( q(z) = z - De^{Et} \\\\) (where D and E are constants) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 remain solely dependent on A and not on B, C, D, or E?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( q(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics, affecting both the trajectory and endpoint. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interplay of A, B, C, D, and E due to the combined effects of these transformations and their timing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
