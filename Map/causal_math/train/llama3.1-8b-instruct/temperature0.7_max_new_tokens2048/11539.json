  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) over time t, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number. We are interested in the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds\\\\) applied to z.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(h(z) = z^*\\\\) (complex conjugate) is applied as an intervention on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and then the transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is reapplied, will the result of \\\\(T(z)(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be simply the sum of the original and conjugate integrals of z?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies z(t) post \\\\(t_1\\\\) into its complex conjugate, fundamentally altering z's trajectory and hence, the concept of simply summing the original and conjugate integrals becomes incorrect. The outcome will be dependent on exactly how z was altered (here, conjugated) post-intervention and how these complex values accumulate over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
