  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices, and x is an initial condition vector. We examine the influence of the Laplace transform \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number, during different interventions over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention altering D to a new constant matrix E is applied, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward be independent of the initial matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening and changing D to E creates a new system dynamics starting at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The result of the Laplace transform for times greater than \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect the change, indicating dependency on both the initial condition influenced by D and the subsequent dynamics governed by E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
