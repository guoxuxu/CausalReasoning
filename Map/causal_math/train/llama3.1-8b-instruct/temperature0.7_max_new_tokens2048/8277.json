  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the complex function is \\\\( z(t) = w(t) + iu(t) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) representing the real part and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) the imaginary part governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{w} = Cw\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\), here C and D are constant matrices. Analyze the system after applying the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(w(t)) + i\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) and then conducting an inverse transform.\n\nIf the Laplace transform followed by an inverse transform is applied to \\\\( z_0 = w_0 + iu_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{w} = Cw\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\) without further intervention, will the \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform followed by the inverse transform is mathematically designed to reconstruct the original function, leaving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) unchanged theoretically. Thus, the system's state at any later time T would follow its intended trajectory had no transformation occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
