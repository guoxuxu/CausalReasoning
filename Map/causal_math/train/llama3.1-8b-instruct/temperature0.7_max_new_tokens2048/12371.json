  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\\n\nCan the original functional form of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) be reconstructed just from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) knowing all applied transformations, including \\\\( e^{ax^2} \\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given complete knowledge of the transformations and their order of application, it is theoretically possible to reverse each transformation and reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), provided these transformations are invertible and well-defined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
