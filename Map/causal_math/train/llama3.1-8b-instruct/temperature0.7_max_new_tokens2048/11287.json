  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We analyze the effect of complex conjugation on this function and any potential impacts on integral transformations of the resulting function over time t.\n\nIf an additional operation of complex exponentiation by \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) is applied midway through the evolution of the function, will the Fourier transform at t = T exclusively depend on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention operation will also affect the overall transformation and thus the Fourier transform at t = T. The composition of exponential terms where the bases are also exponentials produces changes in the resulting Fourier transform that are distinct from those produced solely by the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
