  "Problem": "Investigate the causal inference in an electrical circuit with a complex function impedance represented by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + Ls \\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) are the capacitance and inductance respectively. We will examine the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which transforms the input current source \\\\( i(t) \\\\) through a Laplace transform with a added constant shift in the s-plane, \\\\( i(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(i(t)) + k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the original input current \\\\( i_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing the voltage \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether a shift \\\\( k \\\\) was applied in the Laplace domain?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of the shift \\\\( k \\\\) applied during the Laplace transform, it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( i_0(t) \\\\) merely from \\\\( v(t) \\\\). The shift influences the entire dynamics, thus complicating the reverse deduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
