  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, on the function over a time interval is analyzed.\n\nOn observing the function at time \\\\( T \\\\) and knowing that \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), can we exactly deduce the function's form at earlier times without knowing if any transformation such as \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature and time-invariance of the differential equation, its future or past states can be uniquely determined from any present state assuming no additional transformation has affected the system. Any transformation like \\\\( T(z) \\\\) represents a separate computation that does not impact the system’s inherent dynamic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
