  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function mid-process to \\\\( z(t) = (t+1)e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at some time t_1 < T, will the final outcome of the transformation \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) still reflect only the effects of the initial function form?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the initial function to a new form, which would then contribute differently to the integral transformation from time t_1 onward. This modification affects the final outcome, making it a composite result of both the original function and the intervention, thereby not solely reflecting the initial function form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
