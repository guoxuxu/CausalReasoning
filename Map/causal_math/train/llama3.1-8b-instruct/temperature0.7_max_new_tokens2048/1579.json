  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\) where c is a complex number. We analyze the impact of integral transformations using the Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). Let's examine the transformations with and without interventions on the function and its reverse causality.\n\nIf at a certain point s = S1, we apply an intervention by modifying t to \\\\( t+u \\\\) where u is a real number, will the transformation of \\\\( f(t+u) \\\\) at s = S still purely depend on the original c in the absence of other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by shifting t to \\\\( t+u \\\\) modifies the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( (t+u)^2 + c(t+u) \\\\), which changes the integral in the Laplace Transform. This shift affects the dependence on c since both the squared term and the linear term with c are altered, meaning that the output depends on both c and u.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
