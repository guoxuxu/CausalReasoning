  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) might result from various combinations of interventions due to the superposition principle in quantum mechanics and the non-commutative properties of the exponential operators used in \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and \\\\( V(t) \\\\). Without additional information, it is impossible to uniquely determine which interventions were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
