  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing dynamic states of a system, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. A transformation defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a complex constant matrix is introduced.\n\nAssuming that after a specified time t_1 an additional complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant matrix) is applied, will the eventual state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original dynamics (A and B) and disregard the transformations applied (C and D)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further modifies the trajectory, incorporating effects from matrices D in addition to C. Thus, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the compounded influence of A, B, C, and D, making it not solely reliant on the original dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
