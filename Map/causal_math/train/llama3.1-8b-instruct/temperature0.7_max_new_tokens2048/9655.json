  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} x \\\\) defining a rotation in the complex plane, where A is a real constant matrix and x is a complex vector. We investigate how time-dependent transformations \\\\( f(t, z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with B also a constant matrix, influence the system's evolution.\n\nConsidering a specific intervention by applying a transformation \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 unaffected by B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) results in a compositional effect involving matrices A, B, and C. Since these matrices define separate and potentially non-commutative dynamic transformations, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any time T > t1 will be influenced by all three, leading to a unique trajectory dictated by their combined rotational effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
