  "Problem": "Consider a control system modeled by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z is a function representing system states over time. The impact of applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by introducing a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix), will the final output \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T be dependent exclusively on A?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds an additional layer of influence through the matrix C affecting the subsequent state of z. This results in an output at T that is a result of the compounded effects of A, B (from the initial \\\\( g(z) \\\\)), and C, making the final system state a function of all three matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
