  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to definitively trace back and determine which transformations (\\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\) or both) were applied solely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from multiple possible applications of the transformations \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\), due to the potential overlapping effects and non-uniqueness in the way the transformations interact with the system. Hence, knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not suffice to determine the specific transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
