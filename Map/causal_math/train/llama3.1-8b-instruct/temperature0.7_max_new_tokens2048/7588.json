  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable z, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^t dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. The question examines the sensitivity of the integral transformation under varying parameters.\n\nWith the knowledge of the output from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) and a parameter shift to \\\\( s+\\\\delta \\\\), can we accurately determine the specific interventions applied?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) post-intervention could potentially result from various combinations of parameter shifts and transformations of z. Consequently, multiple scenarios could lead to the same output, making it unclear what specific changes were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
