  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation under a Fourier transformation, denoted as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -k^2 \\\\hat{u} + \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k,t) \\\\) is a transformed external force. The parameter k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nIf an intervention is applied in the form of a new force term \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k,t) = e^{-k^2 t}k \\\\) at some time t>0, will the state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) for T>t solely depend on the initial and new force term, disregarding any prior applied force \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k,t) \\\\) introduces another dynamic into the equation, affecting the future states. Previous forces and conditions influence the solution up to t, and post-intervention solution paths need to consider the cumulative effects of all applied terms, both \\\\( \\\\hat{f} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\hat{g} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
