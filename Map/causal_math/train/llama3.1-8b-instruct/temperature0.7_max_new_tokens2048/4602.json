  "Problem": "Consider a system of equations governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\) is applied to this system resulting in the transformed function \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t,s) x(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) at s = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the form of the kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific kernel \\\\( K(t,s) \\\\), it is impossible to accurately reverse engineer the original function \\\\( x(s) \\\\) since different kernels could modify the contributions of earlier states of \\\\( x(s) \\\\) in various ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
