  "Problem": "Evaluate the causality in a system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze this under the operation of the integral transformation represented by \\(\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt\\), where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\) is applied to a vector \\(z_0\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\) without further intervention, will \\(z(t)\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\(z_0\\) to t = T under \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\(\\mathcal{T}(z)\\) changes the initial condition \\(z_0\\) by adding an integral term, affecting the system's trajectory due to \\(D\\) introducing potentially different dynamics from \\(C\\). At time \\(T\\), \\(z(t)\\) will reflect the compounded impact of both \\(D\\) and \\(C\\), leading to a different final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
