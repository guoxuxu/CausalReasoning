  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a time-dependent state of the system. The impact of convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) expressed as \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is the current state of the system, and it is allowed to evolve under the original rules without further intervention, will \\\\( L[h(t)] \\\\) at some later time T still incorporate the effects of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in its representation?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) fundamentally alters the system's state. The Laplace Transform \\\\( L[h(t)] = F(s)G(s) \\\\) incorporates the influence of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and this combined effect persists in the transform domain without degradation over time unless intervened.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
