  "Problem": "Examine a control system defined by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Cx + Du\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix and \\(D\\) is the control input matrix. The analysis covers the impact of a non-linear transformation \\( h(x) = \\sin(Kt) x \\) on the system's state \\(x\\), over time \\(t\\), where \\(K\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\( x(T) \\), can we identify definitively the interventions used (whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( i(x) \\), or both), solely by knowing the state at \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( x(T) \\) might result from different sequences or combinations of applied transformations \\( h(x) \\) and interventions \\( i(x) \\), along with different control inputs \\( u \\) across the period. The various possible combinations and their non-linear interactions render it unfeasible to uniquely decipher the sequence of events leading to \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
