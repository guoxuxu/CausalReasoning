  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with respect to its behavior modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = f(t) \\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace transform of the differential equation is considered to see the change in the solution's domain from time to frequency.\n\nGiven the final observed behavior of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after applying the Laplace transform and an intervention, can we determine precisely what transformations and interventions were applied only by observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) could result from various transformations and interventions in the frequency domain, making it non-trivial to uniquely backtrack and identify what specific operations (like transformations or added factors) were performed. This ambiguity arises due to the many-to-one nature of differential solutions and their sensitivity to initial conditions and transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
