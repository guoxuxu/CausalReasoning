  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and its interaction with different operational kernels. Through this scenario, we explore a system modeled by the equation \\\\( L[g(t)](s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2 + b^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is known to be a damped sine function, and the Laplace transform is applied without any further transformation, will the resulting function in the s-domain remain strictly of the form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "A function like a damped sine wave, typically resulting in a transformed function involving both sine and cosine components, leads to a more complex s-domain expression than simply \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\). Thus, the operation generates components reflecting both decay and oscillatory behavior, not just a simple pole.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → b; b → (s - a)^2; (s - a)^2 + b^2 → 1/((s - a)^2 + b^2); 1/((s - a)^2 + b^2) → L[g(t)](s); L[g(t)](s) → g(t); g(t) → damped sine function; 1/((s - a)^2 + b^2) → strictly of the form 1/(s + a)"
