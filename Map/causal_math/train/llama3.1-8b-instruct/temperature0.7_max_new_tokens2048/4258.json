  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of the complex function z(t). The functions are related through the Laplace Transform: \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we retrieve the original forms of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) \\\\) by observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at any time t and applying the inverse operations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the Laplace Transform, observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) allows us to apply Laplace Transform to obtain \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The Laplace Transform is uniquely reversible, assuming the necessary conditions for existence are satisfied, hence we can precisely trace back to the original transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
