  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) representing a complex valued function, where \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), and \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real valued functions governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = A u \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = B v \\). We further study the transformation by the integral operator \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{C s} z(s) ds \\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a new operator \\( \\mathcal{S}(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{D s} z(s) ds \\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting function \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), disregarding \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention introduces another modifying layer represented by \\( e^{D s} \\), making the end state \\( z(T) \\) dependent on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), in addition to \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The superposition of integral transformations significantly impacts the resultant state at \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
