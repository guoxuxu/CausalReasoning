  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original function form at t = 0 after observing the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation masks the original state by accumulating history-dependent changes, complicating the trace back to the initial state without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
