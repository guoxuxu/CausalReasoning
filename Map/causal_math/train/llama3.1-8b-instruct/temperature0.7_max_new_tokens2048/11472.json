  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and are solutions to the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P is a constant complex number and Q is a complex forcing term. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\), with another constant complex number S, investigates the effects on this system.\n\nGiven the final complex state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine definitively the interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping impacts of exponential growth and rotations due to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), combined with the complex plane's dynamics, lead to multiple potential precursory conditions and interventions that could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The ambiguity of exponential transformations in the complex plane prevents precise determination of the type of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
