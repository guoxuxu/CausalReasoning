  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ruled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2 \\\\), where A and B are constants. We investigate the impacts of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and the nonlinear term \\\\( Bz^2 \\\\) complicate the trajectory. The ambiguity in the system's evolution precludes backward determination of the exact initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
