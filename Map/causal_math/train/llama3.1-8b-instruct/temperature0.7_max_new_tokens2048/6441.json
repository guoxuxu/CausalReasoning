  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\( S(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of modifying this system using another transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\) over time t, where M is a transformation matrix that describes an intervention.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is not applied and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is simply evolved over time t under \\\\( S(x) = Dx \\\\), can we infer that the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will always follow the trajectory dictated by \\\\( Dx \\\\) without deviations?",
  "Explanation": "Without the intervention of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the system's state evolves strictly according to \\\\( Dx \\\\). The transformation generates a predictable path determined only by the original matrix D, following the natural dynamics of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
