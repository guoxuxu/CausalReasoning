  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( x(s) \\\\) is an input function. We study how manipulations through a specific function \\\\( g(x) = x + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, influence the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by again applying a function \\\\( h(x) = x - d \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( y(T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), depend only on the kernel function \\\\( K \\\\) and not on the interventions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's output at \\\\( T \\\\) will incorporate effects of both interventions. Since each adjustment alters the input which then influences the integral, \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will involve a layered effect of both \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) added to the input function via the integral, affecting the outcome in a compound manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
