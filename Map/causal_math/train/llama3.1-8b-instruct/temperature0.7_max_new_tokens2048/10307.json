  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a linear operator described by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the behavior of the vector field under the mapping \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a transformation matrix, by applying it at different times t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(x) = Nx \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on the matrix D and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) with \\\\( k(x) = Nx \\\\) introduces a new transformation affecting the trajectory of our vector field, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent also on matrices M and N, alongside D. The transformations due to \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can distinctly alter the vector field pathway leading up to T, depending on their relationship with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
