  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nIf during the path from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\), an intervention is made to deliberately encircle a singularity of another function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - c} \\\\), will this affect the integral result of \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a second function's singularity affects only its own integral behavior. The function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) remains unaffected by the singularity of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as long as \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) does not have a singularity at the same point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "intervention → path modification; path modification → encircling singularity; encircling singularity → presence of singularity; presence of singularity → f(z) value; f(z) value → integral result; intervention → integral result"
