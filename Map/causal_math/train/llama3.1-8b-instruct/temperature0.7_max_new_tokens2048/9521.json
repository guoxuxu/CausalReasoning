  "Problem": "In a fluid dynamics context, we consider the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. To study the effect of a varying thermal diffusivity, a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modulates \\\\( k \\\\) as \\\\( k(t) = k_0 h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k_0 \\\\) being the initial thermal diffusivity.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is integrated into the heat equation from the start without further manipulation, will the temperature profile \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to a scenario where \\\\( h(t) = 1 \\\\) for all \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), by altering the value of \\\\( k \\\\), impacts the rate at which temperature diffuses through the medium. Variations in \\\\( k(t) \\\\) alter the heat equation's behavior, leading to a different temperature profile at time \\\\( T \\\\) compared to when \\\\( k \\\\) is constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
