  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function operates in a space undergoing changes described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), with A being a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then the system evolves based on \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be identical to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "By transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), it influences the initial conditions and hence the system's trajectory. The multiplication by \\\\( e^{iT} \\\\), an exponential function of a complex number, modifies the growth rate and direction, leading to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
