  "Problem": "Consider the system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) to this system and studying its evolution.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we recover the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) provides a transformed state influenced by both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the exponential term, recovering \\\\( x_0 \\\\) solely from this information is ambiguous without separation of the exponential influence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
