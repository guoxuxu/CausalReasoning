  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) (where \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency) applied to a signal transformation described by the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{s(t)\\\\} = S(\\\\omega) \\\\). We examine the impact of modifying the frequency component by multiplying the original signal by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the transformed signal is Fourier transformed without further intervention, will the Fourier transform result \\\\( S'(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the same as the original \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) causes a frequency shift in the original signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\). The Fourier transform of the modified signal \\\\( s'(t) = s(t)e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) will be \\\\( S'(\\\\omega) = S(\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0) \\\\), indicating a shift, hence the transformed signal's spectrum is not the same but shifted.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
