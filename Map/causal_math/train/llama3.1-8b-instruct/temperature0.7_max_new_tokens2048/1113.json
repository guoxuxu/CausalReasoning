  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a Fourier transform, subjected to a filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and then converted back using the inverse Fourier transform. Let's denote the output signal as \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(H(s) \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t))) \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a sinusoidal function without any initial alteration before applying the Fourier transform, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be solely determined by the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by how the filter \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alters the transformed signal in the frequency domain. The nature of the filter defines the characteristics of the output, assuming no additional interventions modify the signal processing path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
