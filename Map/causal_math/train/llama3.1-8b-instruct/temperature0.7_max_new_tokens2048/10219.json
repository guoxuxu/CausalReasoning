  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf, after initially computing \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), an intervention changes the function to be integrated to \\\\(g(z) = z + f(z)\\\\), will the result of the new integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C g(z) dz\\\\) still reflect the original integral without considering the effects of\\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the integrand to \\\\(g(z) = z + e^{z^2}\\\\) introduces additional complexities that distinctly affect the integral's value. Since the transformation incorporates terms involving \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\), it will not merely reflect the original simple pole structure around \\\\(z=a\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
