  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional space where a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)) \\\\) influences particle trajectories. We analyze the impact of applying a transformation defined by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), which rotates vectors by a fixed angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nGiven the altered states and orientations of particles at a later time \\\\( T \\\\), can we decipher which transformations, between \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( L' \\\\), or combinations thereof, were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The combinations of the transformations and their effects on particle trajectories can be complex and have overlapping influences due to differing angles. Multiple scenarios could lead to the same observed state at \\\\( T \\\\), causing ambiguity in back-calculating to the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
