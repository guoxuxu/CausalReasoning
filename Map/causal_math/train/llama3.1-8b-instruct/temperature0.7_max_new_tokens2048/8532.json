  "Problem": "Consider a heat conduction process governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( u_t \\) and \\( u_{xx} \\) denote the temporal and spatial second derivatives of \\( u \\) respectively, and \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\). Analysis involves examining the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(s, t) \\) applied at t = 0.\n\nGiven the solution \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) at t = T, can we conclusively determine the time \\( t_1 \\) at which the thermal diffusivity changed from \\( k \\) to \\( k^\\prime \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in potential transformations due to exponential decay terms in solutions involving \\( k \\) and \\( k^\\prime \\), as well as the potential similarity in decay patterns, precludes precise determination of the exact time \\( t_1 \\) of intervention without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
