  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency parameter. We study the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse in the system, given by the transformations \\\\( f(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(z) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation by a different parameter \\\\( k \\\\), where \\\\( h(z) = e^{k{t}}z \\\\) is applied after the initial Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the resulting function after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) still be solely a function of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a dependency on the new parameter \\\\( k \\\\) before the inverse Laplace transform is applied. This modifies the spectral characteristics of the signal, leading to a final outcome dependent on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
