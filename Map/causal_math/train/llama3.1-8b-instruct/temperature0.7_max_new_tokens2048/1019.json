  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) represented as a matrix on a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) under the flow given by \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\mathbf{x}} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a square matrix. The transformation applied is \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = L\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\), and we are interested in evaluating how this affects the system dynamics.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using another matrix transformation \\\\( N \\\\) is applied to the system, will the final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\( N \\\\) introduces a new dynamic layer. The state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is influenced by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and altered by the early application of \\\\( L \\\\) as well as the later application of \\\\( N \\\\). The interaction among these matrices shapes the trajectory and final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
