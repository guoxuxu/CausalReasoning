  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of the system. The effect of the integral transformation described by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed with respect to its impact on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) given the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) had been applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The potential application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) complicates backtracking to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) as it entails an integration process influenced by \\\\( B \\\\), which impacts the trajectory in a non-trivial way, obscuring the original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
