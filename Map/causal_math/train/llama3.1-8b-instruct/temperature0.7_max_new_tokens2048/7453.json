  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) initially, and then allowed to evolve by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\) for time T without further changes, will the resulting \\\\( w(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was evolved by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) changes the initial condition from \\\\( w_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{iT}w_0 \\\\). Since the transformation modifies the magnitude and phase of the system state vector initially, it will typically lead to a different state at time T when evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), unless A is specifically tailored or zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
