  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the elliptic partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\\\lambda u(x, y)\\\\) in a region \\\\(D\\\\). We explore how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which converts functions into their frequency components, influences our understanding of the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) of the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) is calculated, then is the resulting function in the frequency domain affected by the presence of \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) in the original PDE without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\), which is affected by the parameter \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), reveals how the solution's frequency components are scaled. Each frequency component is scaled inversely proportional to \\\\(\\\\lambda + |\\\\xi|^2\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\xi\\\\) represents the dual frequency variables. Thus, \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) significantly influences the transformed result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
