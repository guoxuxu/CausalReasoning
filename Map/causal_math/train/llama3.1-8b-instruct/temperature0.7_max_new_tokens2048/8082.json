  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. We analyze the behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without being aware of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), or the specific matrix C, the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be deduced solely based on the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation could have altered the initial condition in a complex, non-reversible way, especially if C carries distinct eigenvalues compared to A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
