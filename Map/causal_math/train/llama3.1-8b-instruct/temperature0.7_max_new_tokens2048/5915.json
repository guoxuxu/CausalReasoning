  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), the scaling linear transformation \\\\(L(v) = sv\\\\) is applied as an intervention and the vector continues to rotate, will the final state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on the rotational transformation and not on the scaling factor \\\\(s\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the scaling transformation \\\\(L(v) = sv\\\\) alters the magnitude of the vector, which affects its subsequent rotation trajectory. Therefore, the final state at time \\\\(T\\\\) is dependent on both the initial rotation parameter \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\(s\\\\), influencing the position and size of the vector at \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
