  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the original system without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) essentially changes the representation from time domain to complex frequency domain, altering how the dynamics are observed and analyzed. As this transformation is a form of integration, it aggregates the history of the system up to time T, which cannot be inverted to yield the same state as direct evolution without such a transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
