  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) representing a complex valued function, where \\\\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\\\). We analyze the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ h(z) \\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) also belongs to the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the precise form of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the filtering function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) solely from the final transform function, knowing only that it includes elements like \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s = -\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed function having poles at specific locations such as \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s = -\\alpha \\\\) indicates the effects of the original function and the filtering. However, there may be multiple combinations of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) (potentially including other components besides the sinusoidal function) and different parameters for \\\\( G(s) \\\\) that could result in the same pole structure in the transformed function. Without additional information, the original formulation and exact filtering process cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
