  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed state \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing it a priori?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the system's evolution, losing specific information about the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the integral's averaging effect. The specific phase information of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
