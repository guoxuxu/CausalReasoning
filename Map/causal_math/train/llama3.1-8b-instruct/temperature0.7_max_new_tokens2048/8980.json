  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modulated by a stochastic process defined as \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + dB_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( B_t \\\\) is a Brownian motion. We are interested in the behavior of \\\\( X_t \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( f(X) = e^{Ct}X \\\\) for a constant matrix \\\\( C \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( F(X_t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)A}X_s ds \\\\).\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\( F(X_T) \\\\) at time T and knowing the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Dt}X \\\\) took place, can we identify whether the transformation \\\\( f(X) \\\\) was also applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic nature of \\\\( B_t \\\\) and the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials applied at different times make it challenging to disentangle the influence of \\\\( f(X) \\\\) from just the observation of \\\\( F(X_T) \\\\). Multiple combinations of initial conditions and interventions could lead to the same observed outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
