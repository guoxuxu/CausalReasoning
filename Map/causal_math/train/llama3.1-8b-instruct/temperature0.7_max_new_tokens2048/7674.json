  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system controlled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = r(t)e^{i\\\\theta(t)} \\\\), where \\\\( r(t) \\\\) is the amplitude and \\\\( \\\\theta(t) \\\\) is the phase. A transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = ze^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) with a complex constant \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is considered over time t.\n\nCan we conclusively determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T if we are uncertain whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the certainty of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the differences in the potential amplitude and phase due to the transformation by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) make it impossible to accurately trace back to the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
