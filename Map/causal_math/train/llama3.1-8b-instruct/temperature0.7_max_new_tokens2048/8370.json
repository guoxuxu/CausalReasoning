  "Problem": "Consider an iterative linear system transformation defined by the equation \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) applied periodically over discrete time steps t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x_n \\\\) at t = N without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial intervention using \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), it is impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) as the transformation modifies the initial condition. This absence of knowledge about the use of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) means we cannot uniquely reverse the transformations applied by M and D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
