  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined over the complex domain and transformed through a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} z(x) \\\\, dx \\\\). We aim to analyze the relationship between the original function and its transform's behavior, specifically through operations such as scaling and modulation.\n\nIf a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is initially modulated by \\\\( e^{-ibx} \\\\), and later its Fourier transform is scaled in frequency by \\\\( c \\\\) (i.e., considering a transform given by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\to c\\\\omega \\\\)), will the resulting transform reflect only the original modulation and not the frequency scaling?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier transform of the modulated and frequency-scaled function reflects both operations. The modulation shifts the spectrum by \\\\( b \\\\), while the frequency scaling changes the spread and positioning of the spectrum by \\\\( c \\\\). The resulting transform is different from the scenario where only the modulation or only the scaling is applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "modulation → phase shift; frequency scaling → change in frequency; Fourier transform → representation change; phase shift → modulation; modulation → change in representation; frequency scaling → change in representation; change in representation → change in frequency",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Modulating the original function with e^{-ibx} causes a phase shift, which results in a change in representation in the Fourier transform. Scaling the frequency in the Fourier transform causes a change in frequency, which reflects the original modulation but not the frequency scaling in the resulting transform."
