  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F[z] = \\\\int e^{iBt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) over time interval [0, T], where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nBy observing the result of \\\\( F[z] \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we deduce the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowledge about the transformation \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation involves convolution with \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) which blends with the structural properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of the presence and form of \\\\( F \\\\), retrieving \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from the outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is unfeasible due to loss of information and possible diverse solutions fitting the resultant transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
