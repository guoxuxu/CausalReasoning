  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. The function acts on an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\)\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\), at time T, be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved to time T under \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\) starting from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) describes the evolution of the system over time by its very definition, the application of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and allowing it to evolve naturally without intervention will indeed result in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) being exactly as it is defined by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(t)z_0 \\\\). The evolution is deterministic and solely dependent on \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
