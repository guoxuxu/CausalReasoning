  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space where functions are defined as \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real number. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on these functions across variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) for some \\\\( s \\\\), can it be conclusively argued that \\\\( A \\\\) was or was not modified to \\\\( A + \\\\Delta A \\\\), based solely on the Laplace transform output?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the Laplace transform, while indicative of changes, does not uniquely determine whether \\\\( A \\\\) was modified to \\\\( A + \\\\Delta A \\\\) due to the potential for multiple transformations resulting in similar or the same outputs, especially if \\\\( \\\\Delta A \\\\) imparts a change counterbalanced by the dynamics of other parameters within \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → h(x); h(x) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → output; s → Laplace transform; A + ΔA → A"
