  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real constants and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is used to transform an initial condition in a spatial eigenfunction problem governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -Au + iBu \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies the constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's behavior at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be independent of the original constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constants \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) partway through evolution introduces a new dynamic that depends both on the initial segment of evolution (influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)) and the latter part governed by \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\). Hence, the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of both segments of the dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
