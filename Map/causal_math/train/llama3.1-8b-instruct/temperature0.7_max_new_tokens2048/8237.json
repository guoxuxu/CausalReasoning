  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx + Nu \\\\), with M and N as constant matrices representing the system dynamics and control input respectively. We consider the role of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = k^Tx \\\\) applied at different times, where k is a constant matrix and T denotes the transpose.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is subsequently evolved according to \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\) without further control input \\\\( u \\\\), will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same equation without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) effectively changes the initial condition to \\\\( k^T x_0 \\\\), which impacts how the state evolves under the dynamical system. The trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will diverge from that of an untransformed \\\\( x_0 \\\\), influenced by the new initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
