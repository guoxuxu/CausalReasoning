  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with an initial state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and a square matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The dynamics of the system are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) \\\\). For the purpose of investigation, we introduce a transformation function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix, influencing the state vector.\n\nCan the precise interventions (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or any other interventions) be fully determined by just the observation of the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and knowledge of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations introduced by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\) can result in similar or overlapping state trajectories depending on their relationship with \\\\( A \\\\) and each other. Since multiple pathway combinations could lead to the same state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), merely knowing \\\\( A \\\\) is not sufficient to decipher the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
