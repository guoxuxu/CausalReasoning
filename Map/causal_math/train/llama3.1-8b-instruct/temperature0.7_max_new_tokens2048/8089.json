  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle in a potential, \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\nabla^2 \\\\psi + V(x) \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is the potential energy function. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iHt/\\\\hbar} \\\\), where H is a Hamiltonian operator.\n\nIf \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is applied to a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to Schrödinger's equation, will the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under Schrödinger’s equation without applying \\\\( U(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(t) \\\\) modifies the initial state, changing the evolution trajectory of the wave function. Even though \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is unitary and preserves norms and orthogonality, it alters the phase and spatial properties of the wave function, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
