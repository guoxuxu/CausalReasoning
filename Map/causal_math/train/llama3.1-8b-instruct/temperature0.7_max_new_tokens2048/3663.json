  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), within a system governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L(z) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 z \\\\). Analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( I(z) = e^{i2\\omega t} z \\\\) is applied, will the behavior of the system at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depend uniquely on the operator \\\\( L(z) \\\\) and not on the initial transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( I(z) \\\\) further complicates the dynamic by introducing an additional frequency component to the system, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only a function of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) but also influenced by both the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and the intervention. These effects are non-trivial and interdependent due to their complex exponential nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
