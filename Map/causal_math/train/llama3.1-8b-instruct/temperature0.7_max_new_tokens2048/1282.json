  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. We are interested in the causality implications of an integral transformation applied to initial conditions given by some function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) related to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a Laplace transform.\n\nGiven \\\\( h(u(t)) \\\\) for all t > 0, can we precisely recover \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) without any prior knowledge of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovery of \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) from \\\\( h(u(t)) \\\\) would require inverse transformation information, which, without explicit knowledge of the behavior of z(t) and the parameters s, makes precise recovery of \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(t) → z(t); s → h(z(t)); h(z(t)) → h(u(t)); z(t) → u_0(t); z(t) is related to u_0(t) by Laplace transform"
