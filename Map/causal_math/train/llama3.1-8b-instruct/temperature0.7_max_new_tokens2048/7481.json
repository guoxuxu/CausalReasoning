  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We also define a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, applied to the function z over the time period t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the vector is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) modifies the trajectory in the complex plane depending on C. This initial alteration changes both the real (x) and imaginary (y) components, causing the final state at time T to differ from the untransformed trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
