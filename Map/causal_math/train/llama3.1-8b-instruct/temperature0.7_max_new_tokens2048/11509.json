  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which describes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. We examine how the Laplace Transform affects this function and the implications for causally interpreting transformations over time.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) is computed, then does \\\\( F(s) \\\\) accurately reflect the continuous, periodic nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under its original definition?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), which is not absolutely integrable over \\\\( [0, \\\\infty) \\\\), does not converge in the usual sense. Therefore, \\\\( F(s) \\\\) might not exist or if applied using certain techniques (like distributional Laplace transform), it may not reflect the periodicity clearly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
