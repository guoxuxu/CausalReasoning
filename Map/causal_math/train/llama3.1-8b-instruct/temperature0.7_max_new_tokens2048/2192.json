  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the time-series data \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}x(T) \\\\), can we determine what interventions occurred (specifically whether the Fourier transform, the filter \\\\( H(f) \\\\), or both were applied) solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the type and sequence of interventions from the end state is complex due to the intertwining of transformations in time and frequency domains. The final observed state could arise from different combinations of initial conditions and interventions, making exact determination from \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
