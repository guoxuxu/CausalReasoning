  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) is used to transform a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) into a complex function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) of a complex variable \\\\(s\\\\). We then apply an inverse Laplace transform to retrieve \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we always determine the original time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform is designed to uniquely recover \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\), assuming all necessary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Laplace transform hold. Thus, \\\\(f(t)\\\\) can be determined from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
