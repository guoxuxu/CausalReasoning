  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) defined in the complex plane by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's response and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines the effects and causal inferences when the function is modified by a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the transformed integral result \\\\( z(s) \\\\), can the specific transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k \\\\) that was applied to the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified without pre-existing knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "From the transformed integral \\\\( z(s) \\\\) alone, multiple forms of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) could yield similar alterations in the result, especially when considering the variety of function manipulations and the non-unique decomposition of effects in integral transformations. The lack of one-to-one correspondence between transformation and integral result prevents certain identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
