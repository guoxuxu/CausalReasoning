  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. This scenario explores how the Laplace transform impacts the behavior of the function over time.\n\nIf a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and this transformed function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is then used without any further transformation, will the influence of the variable \\\\( a \\\\) still be detectable in \\\\( z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) leads to \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) distinctly defines the form of \\\\( z(s) \\\\). Thus, the influence of \\\\( a \\\\) is directly observable in the transformed function without any additional intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
