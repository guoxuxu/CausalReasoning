  "Problem": "Analyze a system where the temperature distribution along the line, u(x,t), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where k is the diffusivity constant. We consider the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\), where v is a constant scalar added at a specific time t.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(g(u) = u + v\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to determine whether the observed temperature distribution at t = T originated from \\\\(u_0\\\\) or \\\\(u_0 + v\\\\). This indeterminacy arises because the scalar shift v could have modified the initial state in a way that is not detectable only from later temperature observations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
