  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = z e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z e^{Ct} \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system. This change affects how the solution to the differential equation evolves over time, resulting in a trajectory that is distinct from that which would result from evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The presence of the exponential term \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) introduces a shift in the solution's phase and magnitude.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
