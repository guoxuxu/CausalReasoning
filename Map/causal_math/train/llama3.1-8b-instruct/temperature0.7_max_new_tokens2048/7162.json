  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) within a domain. We explore the influence of boundary conditions altering the function \\\\(u\\\\) through an integral transformation \\\\(T[u] = \\\\int_D k(x,y) u(y) dy \\\\), where \\\\(k(x, y)\\\\) is a kernel modifying \\\\(u\\\\) along the boundary \\\\(D\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we definitively trace back if the transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\), it is not possible to assert whether the transformation \\\\(T[u]\\\\) was applied without knowledge of the initial or boundary conditions. The solutions to \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) could be similar through different manipulations or natural boundary evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
