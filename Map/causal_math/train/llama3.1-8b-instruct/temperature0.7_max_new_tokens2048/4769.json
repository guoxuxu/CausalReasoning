  "Problem": "Consider a stochastically driven system modeled by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + BX_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are deterministic matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Brownian motion. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(X) = C e^{Dt}X_t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and explore the system's evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( g(X) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( X_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the original equation without further intervention, will \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( X_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the original stochastic differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\) alters the initial state by the matrix \\\\( C \\\\) and potentially changes the system's dynamics due to the exponential term \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). The stochastic nature of the equation with added effects of \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) introduces a different evolution path, resulting in an altered state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
