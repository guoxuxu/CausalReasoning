  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the action of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time.\n\nBased on knowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we identify which transformations (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used exclusively through \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of magnitude modifications due to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the identical nature of their influencing mechanism, it's infeasible to discern exactly which transformations or their sequence were applied just from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
