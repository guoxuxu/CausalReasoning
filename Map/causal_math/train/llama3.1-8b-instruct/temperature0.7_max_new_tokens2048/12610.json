  "Problem": "Evaluate the causality in a system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze this under the operation of the integral transformation represented by \\(\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt\\), where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\(t_1\\), a new function \\(h(z) = e^{Et}z\\) (where \\(E\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depend solely on \\(C\\) and not on \\(D\\) or \\(E\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\(h(z)\\) introduces a new factor \\(E\\), which modifies the trajectory in combination with effects from \\(D\\) and \\(C\\). The outcome \\(z(T)\\) will depend on how \\(C\\), \\(D\\), and \\(E\\) interact, each potentially altering the path and final state of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
