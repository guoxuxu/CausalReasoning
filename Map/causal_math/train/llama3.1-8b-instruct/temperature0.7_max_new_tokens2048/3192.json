  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( t \\) represents time. The function undergoes a Fourier transformation \\( F(z) \\) which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency components \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nGiven the final modified signal at time \\( T \\), can we determine the exact nature of interventions (original transformations or inverse transformations) used by only analyzing the signal at \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Analyzing the signal at time \\( T \\) provides limited information, mainly reflecting the cumulative effect of both the original and any inverse transformations. The overlap in potential effects from different transformations makes it impossible to uniquely discern the interventions applied solely based on the final signal characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
