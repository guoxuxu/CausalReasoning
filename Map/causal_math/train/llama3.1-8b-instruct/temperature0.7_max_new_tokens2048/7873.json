  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and x is a constant vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We explore how different transformations influence the behavior of function z over time using the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to simplify the analysis.\n\nIf an initial transformation by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) is applied, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under its defined transformation without further changes, will the output at some time T be the same as if the initial vector x was directly used in function z at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by multiplying with \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), which modifies the resulting vector from the one that would occur if x was directly used in function z. The differences between matrix B and A in the exponentials can yield significantly different results at the same time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
