  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observed state \\( z(T) \\) under the system's evolution with unknown initial transformation, can we unequivocally determine whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied at t = 0, or if \\( z_0 \\) was evolved purely under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the value of \\( k \\) or whether the transformation \\( f(z) \\) was initially applied, multiple trajectories including varying complex \\( k \\) values could yield the same \\( z(T) \\). The evolution under \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\) alone is indistinguishable from one altered by some \\( k \\) values solely by observing \\( z(T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
