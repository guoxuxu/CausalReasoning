  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + N \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of system states. The system's behavior is analyzed under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = C e^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are also constant matrices.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another operation \\\\( k(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix, is implemented as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by \\\\( M \\\\) and not by \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the transformation \\\\( k(x) \\\\) with matrix \\\\( F \\\\) introduces further deviations influencing the system state at any later time. Therefore, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on the interplay between \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( F \\\\), which defines a new trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
