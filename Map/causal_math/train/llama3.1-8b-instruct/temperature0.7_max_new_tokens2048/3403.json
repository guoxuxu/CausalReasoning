  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made at time t = t' > 0, such as multiplying \\\\( u(x, t') \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), will the resulting function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) for T > t' be solely dependent on D and not on the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the state of the system at t = t', and this modification impacts the subsequent transformation and evolution of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). The Fourier transform of this modified state would depend not only on D but also significantly on the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
