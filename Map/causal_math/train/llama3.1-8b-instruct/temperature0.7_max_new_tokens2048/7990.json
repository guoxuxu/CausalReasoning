  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) which represents a unit circle in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer, on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nAfter observing a trajectory in the complex plane for \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we infer if a transformation like \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the frequency or rate at which the circle in the complex plane is traversed, we cannot uniquely conclude that \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was applied since multiple values of n can correspond to different frequencies of completing the circle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
