  "Problem": "Let's consider a mathematical model where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) satisfies the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, t)\\\\) is calculated at time t = 0 without any potential change, will the resulting wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) at a later time t = T evolve identically as it would have without applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation and does not alter the underlying function but changes its representation. The evolution of \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) under the Schrödinger equation remains governed by \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and is independent of the Fourier transform itself. Hence, transforming and then inversely transforming back does not affect the solution of the Schrödinger equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
