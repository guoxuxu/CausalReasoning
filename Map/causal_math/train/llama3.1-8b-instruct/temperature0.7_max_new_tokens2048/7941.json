  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time, evolving according to the linear differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), respectively. A Laplace transform is applied to both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), creating a transformed function \\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\).\n\nIf the initial conditions for \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) are set, and the system evolves under their respective differential equations without further intervention, will \\( Z(s) \\) at some s be different if the Laplace transform was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform itself does not alter the original differential equations governing \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\). It provides a different representation (frequency domain) of the same dynamics described by the differential equations. The development of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) remains consistent, whether or not their Laplace transforms are considered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
