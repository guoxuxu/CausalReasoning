  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), described by the equation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-P} \\\\) where P is a complex constant. The integrative effect of a modification function \\\\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\\\) applied at time t=0 is analyzed, where k is a positive integer.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( w(t) = t^m u(t) \\\\) (where m is an integer) is applied as an intervention, will the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\\\) for any s depend only on the original P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( w(t) = t^m u(t) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\\\) dependent on both the original transformation as affected by P and the new characteristic introduced by the power m. The process affects how the function is represented in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
