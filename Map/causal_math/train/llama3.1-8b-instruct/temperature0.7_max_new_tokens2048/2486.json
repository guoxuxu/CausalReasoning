  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\) on an interval \\\\([0, L]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(u(0,t) = 0\\\\) and \\\\(u(L, t) = 0\\\\). An external source \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is introduced, altering the initial condition to \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) of the system at some time T > 0, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(f(x)\\\\) that led to this state, assuming no further data about the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation involves diffusion which inherently blurs initial conditions over time. Due to this smoothing effect, multiple initial conditions could theoretically evolve into similar or indistinguishable states at later times, thus the original \\\\(f(x)\\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
