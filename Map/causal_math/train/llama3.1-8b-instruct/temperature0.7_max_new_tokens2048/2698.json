  "Problem": "Examine the causality in a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are considering the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, without knowledge about whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied, the differential progress and modification through the operator L might leave several possible initial states that could lead to the observed \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), especially if effects of L are dissipative or dispersive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
