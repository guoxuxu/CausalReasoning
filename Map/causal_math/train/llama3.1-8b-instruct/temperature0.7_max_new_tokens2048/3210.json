  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nAfter observing the potential function \\\\(u(x, y, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we infer the original non-transformed boundary conditions at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) without knowing about the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge that \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied to the boundary conditions, an observer cannot determine the original state, as the transformation significantly alters the potential distribution and masks the original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
