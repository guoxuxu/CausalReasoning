  "Problem": "Consider a boundary value problem for the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a bounded region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) with boundary conditions specified by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\). We investigate the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary data \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then solving the modified problem.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is replaced by its Fourier transformed version \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) and the problem is solved for \\\\( u \\\\), will the solution inside \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) change fundamentally compared to the original problem with \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation of the boundary data changes the frequency components of the boundary conditions, which in turn affects the solution \\\\( u \\\\) inside the region. The solution depends sensitively on the boundary conditions, and transforming these conditions significantly modifies the resulting field within \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
