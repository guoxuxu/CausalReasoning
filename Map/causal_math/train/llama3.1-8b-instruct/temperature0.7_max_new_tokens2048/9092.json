  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^{zt} dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the implication of perturbing the variable \\\\( z \\\\) through a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z + w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nConsidering the final output \\\\( F(z') \\\\), can we determine unequivocally which perturbations (\\\\( G(z) \\\\) or the intermediate adjustment) were applied to \\\\( z \\\\), based solely on \\\\( F(z') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential functions and integrals involved in \\\\( F \\\\) can lead to various configurations producing similar or the same output due to their overlap in the transformed domain. Disentangling the specific sequence or type of transformations applied without additional information is highly ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
