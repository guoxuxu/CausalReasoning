  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ct}z \\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied.\n\nCan we infer the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by observing the system at time T and knowing the matrices A and B, assuming no transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature of the differential equations and absence of any transformation, observing the system at T allows for a straightforward calculation backward using the inverses of the matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
