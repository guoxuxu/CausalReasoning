  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + B\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + D\\\\), respectively. We investigate the behavior under the integral transform \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nReverse causation: Can we unequivocally determine the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) throughout [0, T] by observing only the behavior of \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) over time without knowing the differential equations for \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) leads to an overlap of effects through the integral of the exponentially scaled \\\\(z(s)\\\\), such that different functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) might result in the same transformed outcome. Without knowing the specific dynamics (differential equations), one can't deconvolve \\\\(T[z](t)\\\\) to retrieve \\\\(z(t)\\\\) uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
