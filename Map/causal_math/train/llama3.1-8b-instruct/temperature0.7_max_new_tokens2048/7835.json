  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\) is mapped using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. We investigate the function under two scenarios: one driven by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\) with B being another complex constant, and another by a transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a third complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is introduced, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by both A and C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) adds a new layer of transformation that affects the system dynamics along with the initial impact of A. Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes contingent on actions by both A and C, through their respective influences on the evolution over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
