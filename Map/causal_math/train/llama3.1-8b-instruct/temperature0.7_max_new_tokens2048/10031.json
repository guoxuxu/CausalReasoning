  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) applied to a complex plane transformation, and the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\). Evaluate the causal relationships regarding the modulation of the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and the effect on the integral \\\\( I(z) \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) as an intervention to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and modify \\\\( w \\\\), does this change the outcome of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) from what was previously zero?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) changes the integral significantly. The complex exponential no longer completes a symmetric path around the origin due to the non-constant radius, making \\\\( I(z) \\\\) generally non-zero, dependent on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
