  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) representing a complex valued function, where \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), and \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real valued functions governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = A u \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = B v \\). We further study the transformation by the integral operator \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{C s} z(s) ds \\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) \\) is applied to \\( z_0 = u_0 + iv_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then allowed to evolve under the systems \\( \\dot{u} = A u \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = B v \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under its respective differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) \\) modifies the initial conditions applied to the differential equations for \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\). The integral operator introduces an additional component influenced by \\( e^{C s} \\), changing the trajectory of both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
