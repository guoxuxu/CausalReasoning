  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. Analyze the causal influences when we alter \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a multiplier \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the observed transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely deduce both the frequency shift \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) used as interventions, by only analyzing the modified transform?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlapping effects of frequency shift and damping factor in the transform domain, it presents an inherent ambiguity in isolating the values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone. Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) can lead to the same modification of the Laplace transform output, rendering exact deductions about the interventions impossible without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
