  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic economic model governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where x and u denote state and control vectors respectively, and A and B are constant matrices. We observe the effect of input changes via the transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = Cu \\\\) for some constant matrix C.\n\nFrom observing the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine if the control vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was transformed by \\\\( g(u) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and C could yield the same state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) due to the linear dependence of the system on u. Without additional information, the specific intervention of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or the original \\\\( u_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
