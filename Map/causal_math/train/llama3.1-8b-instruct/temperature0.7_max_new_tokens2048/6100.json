  "Problem": "Consider the solution to the Laplace equation in a rectangular domain, governed by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 f = 0\\\\). We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary conditions of the domain. Let the boundary conditions change from function \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) to \\\\(h(x, y) = g(x, y) + e^{kx}\\\\), where `k` is a constant.\n\nKnowing the internal solution and that an intervention was performed, can we identify whether the original boundary was set by \\\\(g(x, y)\\\\) or another function?",
  "Explanation": "Even knowing that an intervention occurred, multiple possible original boundary functions could lead to the same internal solution after various corrections are made. Without explicit knowledge of the nature and precise effect of the intervention, deducing the exact original boundary condition or distinguishing it from others remains uncertain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
