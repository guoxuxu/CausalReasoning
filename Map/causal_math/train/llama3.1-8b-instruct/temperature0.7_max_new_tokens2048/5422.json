  "Problem": "Consider a curved surface in the 3D space described by the equation \\( z = f(x,y) \\). We explore the effect of multiple complex transformations on this surface. Specifically, we look at transformations represented by \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) where C is a constant complex matrix.\n\nCan the original characteristics of the surface \\( z = f(x,y) \\) be conclusively determined from observing the transformed surface at time \\( T \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( g(z) \\), and given the complex nature of the transformation \\( e^{Cz} \\), it's impossible to uniquely deduce the original surface properties. The transformation can create various equivalent mathematical conditions leading to the same observed outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
