  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis context where the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) a complex constant, is analyzed in terms of its effect on the unit circle in the complex plane. We are particularly interested in how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), for a real number \\\\( t \\\\), affects the evolution of points under \\\\( f(z) \\\\).\n\nGiven a final point \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) assuming it started on the unit circle and evolved only under \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), multiple points from the unit circle could potentially map to the same point under \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
