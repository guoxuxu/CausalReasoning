  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) in the complex plane, where A is a real constant and i represents the imaginary unit. The function describes rotation around the origin with angular velocity A. We explore different transformations involving the operator \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a positive integer, and examine the trajectories and causality in this rotating system.\n\nCan we, by looking at the function value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after an intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), uniquely determine the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied at t = 0 and the exact time of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The final observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T can result from various combinations of initial power k in \\\\( f(z) = z^k \\\\) and different moments of changing the angular velocity (at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)). The rotating nature and exponential function's sensitivity to initial conditions create a multitude of possible trajectories leading to the same endpoint without a unique solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
