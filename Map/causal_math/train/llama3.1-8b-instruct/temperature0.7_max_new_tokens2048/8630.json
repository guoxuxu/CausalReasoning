  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps complex numbers to other complex numbers, defined by \\\\( z(x) = e^{iAx} \\\\) for a real matrix A. The evolution of the function is then impacted by an operator \\\\( L \\\\) known from integral transforms, specifically \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of the integral transform \\\\( L(z)(x) \\\\), can we infer the original complex input \\\\( x_0 \\\\), assuming no prior knowledge on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( L \\\\) performs an integration that combines the effects over an infinite range, significantly obfuscating individual contributions from specific inputs like \\\\( x_0 \\\\). Additionally, without information about A, which affects how inputs are transformed, the original input \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the resulting integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
