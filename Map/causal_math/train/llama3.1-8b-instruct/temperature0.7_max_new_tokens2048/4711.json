  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( R \\\\) is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) added into the system, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by \\\\( Q \\\\), \\\\( R \\\\), as well as \\\\( P \\\\). Each transformation impacts how the system develops over time, thereby affecting the endpoint at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
