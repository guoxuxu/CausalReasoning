  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex system modeled by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. The transformation considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf a new complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the system's intrinsic properties (here \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)) and not be influenced by the transformations \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces an additional factor influencing the system's behavior, which changes the state independently from the intrinsic rotation caused by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), as all contribute to magnitude and phase transformations over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
