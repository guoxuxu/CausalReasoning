  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system characterized by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\). We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform-based controller defined by \\( G(s) = s + k \\) for some constant \\( k \\) on the system's response.\n\nIf a controller \\( G(s) \\) intervenes after a specific time \\( t_1 \\), and we vary \\( k \\), will the subsequent output \\( y(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depend solely on \\( H(s) \\), disregarding changes in \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\( G(s) \\) means that subsequent outputs will depend on the controller settings, including \\( k \\). The interaction between \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) means that varying \\( k \\) alters the closed-loop system's characteristics and thus the output \\( y(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
