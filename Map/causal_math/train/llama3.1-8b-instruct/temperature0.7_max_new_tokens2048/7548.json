  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects in a system ruled by the partial differential equation \\u2202u/\\u2202t + A\\u2202u/\\u2202x = 0, where A is a constant velocity, under transformations induced by the integral operator T(u) defined \\u2202u/\\u2202x. Analyze how applying Laplace Transforms to u(x,t) influences the solutions.\n\nGiven the observed solution u(x,T), can we definitively state whether the initial condition or the intervention was or was not transformed by a Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "Determining if transformations such as Laplace Transforms were applied during the initial condition setup or the intervention from the endpoint u(x,T) alone is ambiguous. The overlap in effects due to transformation properties, notably in linear superposition, obscures distinct identification of when and where transforms were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
