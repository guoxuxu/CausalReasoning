  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\). An integral transformation using a kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) = e^{-(u^2+v^2)} \\\\) is applied, transforming the function to \\\\( F(u,v) = \\\\int \\\\int e^{-(u^2+v^2)}(x^2 + y^2) dx dy \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\), can we exactly recover the original form of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) without knowing the specific kernel used in the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) from \\\\( F(u,v) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the kernel \\\\( K(u,v;x,y) \\\\) used is infeasible. The kernel potentially modifies the function in a non-invertible way, particularly in the integration over an infinite domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "kernel → integral transformation; integral transformation → transformed function F(u,v); F(u,v) → original function f(x,y)"
