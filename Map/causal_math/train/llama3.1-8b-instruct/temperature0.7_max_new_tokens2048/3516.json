  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effects of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u}\\\\) to the function u and then analyzing its behavior under different scenarios.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(u(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(u)\\\\), or neither), only by knowing the value of \\\\(u(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(u(T)\\\\) reveals the state of the function after evolution under L, but since both the Fourier transform and its inverse are reversible and non-affecting the dynamics governed by L, it's impossible to uniquely determine if these transformations were applied just by observing \\\\(u(T)\\\\). The state outcomes can be identical irrespective of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
