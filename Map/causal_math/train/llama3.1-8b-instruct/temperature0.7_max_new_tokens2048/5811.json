  "Problem": "Consider the system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) satisfies the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) to this system and studying its evolution.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a scaling matrix \\\\( S \\\\) to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is performed, does the resulting Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely reflect the dynamics governed by \\\\( D \\\\) and not the intervention \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S \\\\) alters \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), consequently affecting \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\). This change is reflected in the Laplace Transform, indicating dependency on the nature and timing of the intervention along with the original matrix \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
