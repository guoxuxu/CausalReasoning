  "Problem": "Examine a scenario where the integral transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), described by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt}f(t) dt \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) describes a physical system's response, and various transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) are studied to understand their influence over system behavior.\n\nIf a modification such as a multiplication by \\\\( e^{ax} \\\\) (where a is a constant) is applied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) before performing the Laplace transform, and no further details about \\\\( a \\\\) are known, will the outcome after applying the inverse transform solely depend on the structure of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and not \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( e^{ax} \\\\) and then transforming by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) will change the Laplace transform outcome to a shifted version in the s-domain (\\\\( g(s-a) \\\\)). The process and its inverse would not merely reflect \\\\( f(x) \\\\) unless the intervention is known and appropriately accounted, indicating dependency on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( f(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
