  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that some interventions (\\\\( T(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( H(z) \\\\)) might have been applied, can we precisely identify the initial conditions and ascertain which interventions were performed?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple potential scenarios could lead to the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) because of the non-linear and overlapping influences of the transformations and the underlying dynamics governed by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\). This ambiguity complicates the determination of the specific initial conditions and interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
