  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a complex constant, we consider the impact of the transformation map \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) where \\\\( J \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity introduced by the potential non-commutative nature of \\\\( e^{Jt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) makes it impossible to deduce precisely which operations were applied during the evolution. Different transformations can result in the same endpoint due to their interplay, leading to ambiguity in identifying specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
