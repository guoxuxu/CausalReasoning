  "Problem": "Consider a linear functional transformation operating on functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined in the complex domain. The transformation is described by the integral transform \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We are interested in analyzing the effect of an intervention function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), where the transformed function becomes \\\\( g'(t) = g(t)h(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention \\\\( k(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g''(t) = g(t)k(t) \\\\), will the end state \\\\( G''(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) post \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be dependent solely on the properties of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), without influence from \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( k(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) further complicates the transformation process, embedding the influences of both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k(t) \\\\) within the resultant \\\\( G''(s) \\\\). The transformed function's end state depends on the properties of all applied functions, not just the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
