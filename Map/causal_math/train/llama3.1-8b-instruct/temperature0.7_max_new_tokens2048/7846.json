  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that evolves according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Let \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition and \\\\( F(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, represents an integral transformation applied to \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied, reconstructing the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) becomes ambiguous. The potential modification by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) at t = 0 means the original condition could have been one of multiple possible states depending on the specifics of the exponential matrix \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
