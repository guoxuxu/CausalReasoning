  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The system is characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether a transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reliably trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially since the initial transformation could have altered the trajectory in a way that is not reversibly traceable due to the exponential nature of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
