  "Problem": "Assume we have a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) following the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. At time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the trajectory at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) only depend on the original system parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity affecting the trajectory. The final state at time \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on all three parameters: \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). This dependency arises because both transformations modify the magnitude and potentially the direction of the state vector depending on the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
