  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time. The function is impacted initially by a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) (where A is a complex constant and t is time). We analyze the effect of an operational matrix L of the Laplace transform applied to z(t).\n\nAfter applying the Laplace transform L to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T and observing the result, can we infer the initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowledge of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) being applied?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) may significantly change the initial condition, and without knowing this transformation, the original conditions cannot be accurately deduced just by observing the Laplace transformed output at t = T. The transformation potentially obscures or alters key characteristics of the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
