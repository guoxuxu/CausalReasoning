  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system that filters an input signal x(t) using a transfer function H(s). We examine how impulse response h(t), which is the inverse Laplace Transform of H(s), affects the output y(t) of the system.\n\nAssuming that we observe the system output y(T) at some time T, can we unequivocally infer the original input signal x_0(t) at t = 0 without knowledge of h(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the impulse response h(t), it's impossible to work backward uniquely from y(T) to deduce x_0(t), as different input signals could produce the same output when convoluted with different impulse responses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
