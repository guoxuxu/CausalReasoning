  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where \\( M \\) is a constant complex matrix. An operator \\( T \\) that transforms \\( z(t) \\) is defined as \\( Tz = e^{Nt}z \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf an intervention \\( Qz = e^{Pt}z \\) (where \\( P \\) is a distinct constant complex matrix) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\) and the system is left to evolve further until \\( t = T \\) (> \\( t_1 \\)), does the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) rely solely on \\( M \\) and not on \\( N \\) or \\( P \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\( Qz \\) at \\( t_1 \\) significantly modifies the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\). As a consequence, the final state \\( z(T) \\) depends not only on \\( M \\) but also critically on \\( N \\) and \\( P \\). These transformations, \\( e^{Nt} \\) and \\( e^{Pt} \\), applied at different time points, impact the subsequent evolution and final state of \\( z \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
