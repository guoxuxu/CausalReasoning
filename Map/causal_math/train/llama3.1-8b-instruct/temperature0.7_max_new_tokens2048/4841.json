  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) representing a surface in 3D space. We are examining the effect of two transformations: \\\\(T1(u,v) = (u+1, v-1)\\\\) and \\\\(T2(u,v) = (uv, u-v)\\\\) on the initial coordinate point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\).\n\nIf the point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) is transformed by \\\\(T1\\\\) and then evaluated by \\\\(z(x,y)\\\\), will the value be the same as if executing \\\\(z\\\\) directly on \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) without any transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T1(u,v) = (u+1, v-1)\\\\) alters the coordinates from \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) to \\\\((x_0 + 1, y_0 - 1)\\\\). Since \\\\(z(x,y)\\\\) depends on both x and y quadratically, the calculated value of \\\\(z\\\\) at this new point generally differs from \\\\(z(x_0, y_0)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
