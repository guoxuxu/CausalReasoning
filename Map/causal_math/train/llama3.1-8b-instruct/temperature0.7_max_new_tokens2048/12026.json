  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the impact of an integral transformation represented by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iws} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in the form of a differential operator \\\\( D[f](t) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}f(t) \\\\), will the resulting function at time \\\\( T \\\\) (for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) still be represented as a simple transformation (by either \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)) of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combined effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) as an intervention alters the course of the function beyond simple transformations of \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\). The differential operation introduces an additional dynamic dependent on the derivative, not just the original exponential function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
