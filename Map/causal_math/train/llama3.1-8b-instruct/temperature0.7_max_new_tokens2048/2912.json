  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transform \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. This scenario explores both the direct evolution of the function and the impact of modifications through an operational function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine accurately whether interventions (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied by analyzing only the final output \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) may appear the same under several combinations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) interventions, because the influence of exponential matrix functions at different times can yield similar final states under the integral transform. Without specific phase or functional decomposition data, discerning exact intervention sequences remains uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → T(z)(t); B → z; B → f(z); f(z) → T(z)(t); T(z)(t) → final output"
