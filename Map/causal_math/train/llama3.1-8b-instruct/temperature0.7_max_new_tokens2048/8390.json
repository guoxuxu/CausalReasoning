  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). Analyzing the impact of the inverse transformation given by \\\\( g(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) where \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) knowing only \\\\( g(t) = f'(t) \\\\) and without additional information about initial conditions or boundary values?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( g(t) = f'(t) \\\\) is not deterministically feasible without initial conditions or boundary values since multiple functions could have the same derivative but differ by a constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
