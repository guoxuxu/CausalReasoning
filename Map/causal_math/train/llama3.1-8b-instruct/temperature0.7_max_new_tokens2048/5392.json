  "Problem": "Consider a linear system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the implications of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the system, affecting the solution characteristics over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether the Fourier transform or the Laplace transform, or both) only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used is difficult from just the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) due to the possible overlap in effects from the Laplace and Fourier transforms and non-trivial interactions with the operator L. The transformations' effects in their respective domains do not make it straightforward to isolate and identify their individual impacts retrospectively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
