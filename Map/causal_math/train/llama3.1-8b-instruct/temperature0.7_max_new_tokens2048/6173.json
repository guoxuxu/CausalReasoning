  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Kz \\\\), where K is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\), which transforms the function to \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{z(0)}{s-K} \\\\), and its inverse on the function's evolution over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z}= Kz \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t > 0 \\\\) be equivalent to the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse do not alter the actual differential equation governing the system. The function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), when transformed and then inversely transformed, leads back to the original function governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Kz \\\\), showing that the causal dynamics are preserved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
