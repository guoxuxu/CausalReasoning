  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) on the function u(t).\n\nIf an external force is introduced by modifying the differential operator L to \\\\( L' \\\\) at a certain time t = t_1, and then the system evolves to T > t_1, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) at s = a be exclusively dependent on the new operator \\\\( L' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the operator has changed to \\\\( L' \\\\), the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(s) \\\\) represents the aggregate influence of the operator over the entire time span, including the impact prior to t_1 from L. Thus, it is dependent on both L and L' over the respective intervals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
