  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. This integral transformation is used to analyze the behavior of z(t) in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven only the transformed function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the corresponding time-domain function z(t) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) unambiguously yields \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\). Thus, knowing the frequency domain representation precisely points to its unique time-domain counterpart.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
