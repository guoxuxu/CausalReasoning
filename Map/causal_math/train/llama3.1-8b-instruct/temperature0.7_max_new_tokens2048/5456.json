  "Problem": "In the context of a quantum mechanics framework, the time evolution of a quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, where the Hamiltonian operator \\\\( H \\\\) may involve time-dependent terms. We study the effect of applying an initial quantum gate transformation, represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U \\\\), on the state \\\\( \\\\psi(0) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine uniquely whether the initial transformation \\\\( U \\\\), the intervention \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both were applied during the evolution, knowing only \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) could be obtained through several different combinations of initial states, transformations, and interventions due to the linearity and superposition principle in quantum mechanics. Thus, it is not possible to uniquely identify whether \\\\( U \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both were used based solely on the end state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
