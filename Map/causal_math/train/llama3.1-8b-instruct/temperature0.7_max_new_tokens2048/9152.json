  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by an integral transformation using Laplace Transform with \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We focus on the consequences of modifying this system through a convolution with the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and the corresponding transformation in the Laplace domain is \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformed state \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we determine the specific convolution functions used (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both), just by examining \\\\( Y(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain may be achieved through different combinations and sequences of convolutions, considering the overlapping impacts of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\). Thus, it's not feasible to uniquely determine the interventions from the final result alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
