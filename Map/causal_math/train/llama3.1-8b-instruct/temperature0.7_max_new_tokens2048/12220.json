  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} + i \\\\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds \\\\), where A is a constant and i represents the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of z when affected by transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t, z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given function without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be unchanged compared to directly applying the initial function to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation modifies the initial condition and the trajectory of the function. Since \\\\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) scales and possibly rotates z, the final value at z(T) is altered by B and is not typically the same as simply evolving z(t) from t = 0 to t = T without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
