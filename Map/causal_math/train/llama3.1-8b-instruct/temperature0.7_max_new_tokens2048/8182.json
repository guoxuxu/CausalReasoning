  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\). We are examining the effects of a subsequent operation using the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) of a modified function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex numbers.\n\nGiven the output of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}f(t) \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the parameter \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to correctly back-calculate to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), as the exponential term \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) alters the frequency-domain representation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), affecting the Laplace Transform results uniquely depending on \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier Transform → modified function g(t); parameter a → modified function g(t); Laplace Transform → output of Laplace Transform on g(t); parameter s → output of Laplace Transform on g(t); output of Laplace Transform on g(t) → original function f(t) via inverse Laplace Transform"
