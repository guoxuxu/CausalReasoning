  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit with an impedance represented by the function \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s + c} \\) in the Laplace transform domain, where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. The input to the circuit is a voltage \\( V(s) \\), and the output is current \\( I(s) \\). The response of the circuit is also influenced by an operational amplifier with a Laplace transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\), which can be switched into the circuit as an intervention.\n\nKnowing the output current \\( I(s) \\) at a certain \\( s \\) and that an intervention was used, can we definitively identify whether the operational amplifier \\( H(s) \\) was engaged?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the knowledge of \\( I(s) \\) and that an intervention occurred, multiple interventions could lead to similar \\( I(s) \\) values. Given the nature of the Laplace transform and how components like \\( Z(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\) interact, it isn't possible to definitively conclude the presence of \\( H(s) \\) without additional specific information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
