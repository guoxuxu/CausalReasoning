  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform and its implications on signal processing.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, does the transformed function describe the frequency domain representation of the original time domain signal accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) precisely identifies the frequency \\\\( ω \\\\) in the frequency spectrum, demonstrating a delta function at \\\\( ω \\\\). This transformation is exact and reflects the frequency content of the original time domain signal accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
