  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a linear transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is the initial vector. We examine the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(y) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}y(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) starting from t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(y) \\\\), the effects of B integrated over time obscure the original effects of A alone on \\\\( y_0 \\\\). Consequently, \\\\( y_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) due to the mixed influences of A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
