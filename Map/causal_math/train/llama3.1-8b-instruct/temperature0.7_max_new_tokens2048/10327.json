  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu + f(x) \\\\), where L is a linear operator and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) represents a source term. We analyze the impact of implementing an integral transformation \\\\( T[u] = \\\\int u(x,t) \\\\phi(x)dx \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi(x) \\\\) is a weighting function.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the source term \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to a new term \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), with \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the value of \\\\( T[u(T)] \\\\) depend solely on the linear operator L and not on the changes in \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing the source term to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) alters the evolution of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) directly and thus affects \\\\( T[u(T)] \\\\). As \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) potentially have different influential factors on the dynamics of \\\\( u \\\\), the resulting calculation of \\\\( T[u(T)] \\\\) will be contingent on this change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
