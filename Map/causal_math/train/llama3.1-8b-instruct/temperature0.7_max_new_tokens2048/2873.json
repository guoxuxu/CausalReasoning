  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) which describes the heat distribution in a rod over time. We also examine a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) which transforms the heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is transformed using an initial Fourier transform and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation, will the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as solving the heat equation in the spatial domain without the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator that can be applied initially without affecting the dynamics governed by the heat equation. The solution in the frequency domain will correspond to the solution in the spatial domain when transformed back, hence the end solution remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
