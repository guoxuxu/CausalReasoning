  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)\\\\) is applied to the function \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve governed by the transformed PDE, will \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for some T > 0 be the same as if \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) was evolved under the original PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear and invertible operation that, when applied to the PDE, changes the form but not the fundamental solution to the equation. The evolution in the transform space due to the transformed operator \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) effectively captures the dynamics dictated by L. Transforming back to the original space after evolving preserves the original dynamics, thus the state at time T remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying the Fourier transform → Fourier transform of u(x, 0); u(x, 0) → u(x, T); Applying the Fourier transform → Fourier transform of u(x, T); Fourier transform of u(x, 0) → solution under transformed PDE; solution under original PDE → u(x, T); Fourier transform of u(x, T) → u(x, T)"
