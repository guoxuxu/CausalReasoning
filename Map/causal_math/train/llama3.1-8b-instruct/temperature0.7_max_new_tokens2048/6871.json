  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Investigate how the Fourier transform affects this system, particularly through a transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is the variable of transformation.\n\nIf an intervention applies another Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\omega'' \\\\) during the transformation process, will the resulting double transform depend only on the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega'' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a second Fourier transform at a different frequency introduces additional complexity into the system. The final transform result, being a combination of the effects from \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega'' \\\\), will depend on both these frequencies as well as the original \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The overlapping spectral contributions modify the final output significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
