  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t \\\\ln(1+s) z(s) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final form of the function at T solely depend on the initial condition \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) rather than the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another transformation \\\\( U[z] \\\\) further complicates the system by integrating a new modifying factor \\\\( \\\\ln(1+s) \\\\) with the function. This makes the final state at T depend crucially not only on the original condition but also significantly on the nature and effects of both transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
