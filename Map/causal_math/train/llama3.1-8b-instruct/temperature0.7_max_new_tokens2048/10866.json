  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sC} f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant coefficient, on this complex function over time t.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can one deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( T(f) \\\\) was applied, the original state of \\\\( z(0) = x(0) + iy(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined. The transformation could fundamentally alter initial states, and multiple initial conditions could yield the same outcome at T due to the non-linearity introduced by the exponential and integral in the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
