  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) applied to the function u(t, x) and investigate its evolution.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function as an intervention, will the transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T, x)) \\\\) for T > t_1 still solely depend on L and not on M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M \\\\) introduces another factor that affects the evolution of the system. This modifies the state at T, and thus \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T, x)) \\\\) will depend on both L and M, affecting the resultant transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
