  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, complex matrix, and \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We analyze how the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a constant matrix, changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) does not change the initial condition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) which matches \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) indicates that the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) did indeed have no effect when applied; this can be concluded directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
