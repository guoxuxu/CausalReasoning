  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Let's explore the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\), on this system over a period of time t. Analyze how the inverse transform interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an additional function \\\\( H(t) \\\\), which is a result of another integral transform, is applied as an intervention, will the result at time T (for T > t_1) be independent of the effects caused by both \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and the transformation corresponding to \\\\( H(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(t) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics that, along with the effects from \\\\( G(s) \\\\), determine the trajectory and the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The compound influence of these transformations conditions the system's evolution and cannot be disregarded.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
