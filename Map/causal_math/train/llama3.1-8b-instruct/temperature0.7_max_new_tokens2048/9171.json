  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined solely by matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) post-t_1 introduces additional dynamics beyond the influence of A and B. The overall effect on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend significantly on the matrices C and D due to the transformations affecting both the rate and direction of evolution in the complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
