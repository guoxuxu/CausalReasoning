  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature inside a chamber, denoted as T(t), evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dT}{dt} = k(T_a - T)\\\\), with T_a being the ambient temperature and k a positive constant. An intervention is introduced by adjusting T_a through a function \\\\( f(t) = T_a + \\\\Delta T_a \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), modifying the ambient temperature periodically.\n\nCan we precisely determine the parameters of the intervention (\\\\(\\\\Delta T_a\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)) used, based on the observed temperature T(T) at some endpoint T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\(\\\\Delta T_a\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) could potentially yield the same final temperature T(T) due to the sinusoidal nature of the intervention and the complex dynamics it introduces. Predicting exact parameters from the endpoint alone is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
