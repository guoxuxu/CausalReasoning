  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The function is subjected to a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given, without applying any intervention, and then transformed via the Fourier transform, will the resulting transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) possess a delta function at the specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) inherently results in a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega_0) \\\\) centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\). This is because the Fourier transform of a pure complex exponential is a delta function representing a single frequency component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
