  "Problem": "We consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) with complex variable s is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) initially and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) was directly evolved to T = \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) represents a Laplace-type transformation, which does not affect the real-time evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) is a solution to this differential equation, any application of \\\\( f \\\\) will not alter the real-time behavior or outcome at any specific T, thus \\\\( z(\\\\pi) = -1 \\\\) in both cases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
