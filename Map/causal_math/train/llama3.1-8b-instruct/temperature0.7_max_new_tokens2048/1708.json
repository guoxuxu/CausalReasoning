  "Problem": "Examine the calculation of the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( u(t) = t^2 \\\\) which is then convolved with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t} \\\\). The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transformation used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems responses.\n\nBased on the Laplace transform of the convolution altered by \\\\( e^{st} \\\\), can we deduce that the transformation involved such a scaling factor without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the application of \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) during the convolution process, we cannot infer from the Laplace transform alone that such a modification occurred. The transform could be suggesting various other modifications or no modification, making unique identification impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
