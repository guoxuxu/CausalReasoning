  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{tx} dt \\\\), and we wish to analyze how transformations influence the behavior of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) through various manipulations, involving either differentiation under the integral sign or Laplace Transform.\n\nIf a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z(x)) = z(ax) \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) without further manipulations, will \\\\( L(z(x)) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(x) \\\\) was directly calculated at \\\\( x = aT \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation scales the variable inside the integral linearly which corresponds to the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) of function under exponent. Therefore, the resultant function \\\\( L(z(x)) = z(ax) \\\\) at any specific \\\\( x \\\\) is equivalent to evaluating the original function \\\\( z \\\\) at \\\\( ax \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
