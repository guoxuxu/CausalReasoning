  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system modeled using a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u\\\\), where L is a differential operator which includes non-linear terms. A Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx}f(x)dx\\\\) is applied to the initial condition to verify the impact on a function propagating through this system.\n\nKnowing only the function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations (Fourier, Laplace, or both) and when these were applied during the evolution under L?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multiple transformations applied at different times and the potentially complex and nonlinear operator L, identical end states \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) could arise from various combinations of transformation applications. Without additional information on timings and types of transformations, it is impossible to deduce exactly which were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x,T) → Fourier transform → \\\\hat{u}(k); L → \\\\hat{u}(k); \\\\hat{u}(k) → Laplace transform → \\\\U(s); L → \\\\U(s); \\\\U(s) → solution of the transformed equation → u(x,T)"
