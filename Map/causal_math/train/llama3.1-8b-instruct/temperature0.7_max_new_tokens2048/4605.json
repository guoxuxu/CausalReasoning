  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates the function with a damping exponential, which alters its characteristics fundamentally. The resulting function from transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) will not just be a rotation but an accumulation over time, differing from the simple rotational behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
