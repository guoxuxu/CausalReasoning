  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the original \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) accurately at T > 0 without knowing if a Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the initial Fourier transform, reconstructing the exact initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from the evolved state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is not possible, as the transformation may have altered essential phase or amplitude information of modes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
