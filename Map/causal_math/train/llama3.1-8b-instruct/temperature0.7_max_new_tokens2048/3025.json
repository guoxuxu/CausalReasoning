  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\). We examine how the system evolves with and without the application of \\\\( T \\\\) over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves naturally according to its equation without applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), by time T, will the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be the same as if the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) had been applied at any point?",
  "Explanation": "Without the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\), the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) evolves solely according to the exponential function of a complex variable, unaffected by integration. Applying \\\\( T \\\\) would create an accumulation over the interval, fundamentally altering the resultant function as compared to mere time evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
