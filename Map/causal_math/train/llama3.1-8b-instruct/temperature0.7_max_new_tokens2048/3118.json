  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) in the complex plane, transforming its domain using a Möbius transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants with \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed value \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) for some complex \\\\( z \\\\), can you determine \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f \\\\) was applied before or after \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the order of application of \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\), recovering the original \\\\( z \\\\) is ambiguous because the transformation \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) does not necessarily uniquely map back to a single \\\\( z \\\\) without additional information on the sequence of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
