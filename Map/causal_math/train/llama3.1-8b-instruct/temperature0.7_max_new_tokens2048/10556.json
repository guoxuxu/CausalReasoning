  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint precisely what interventions were performed (whether \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\), \\\\( h(t, y) \\\\), or both), based solely on the output at T?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) does not permit a unique identification of the interventions utilized due to the potential overlap in effects from \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), and the integral transformation characteristics. Different combinations of B, C, and the properties of A could yield indistinguishable results at T, especially considering the non-linear superposition possible in such transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
