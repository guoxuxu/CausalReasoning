  "Problem": "Let's analyze a control system with state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) whose dynamics are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px + Qu \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We observe the effect when transforming the state by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the eventual state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined solely based on \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( k(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another transformation distinct from the initial one, affecting the state's evolution and making the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( N \\\\) as well as \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\). The system's behavior becomes influenced by the interaction between the transformations originating from \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), \\\\( P \\\\), and \\\\( Q \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
