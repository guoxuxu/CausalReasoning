  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled with a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) representing impedance, and a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) which converts time-domain functions into the s-domain. The action is analyzing the behavior of the current function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) when subjected to an input voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\).\n\nIf the voltage function \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\) is applied to the circuit at t = 0 and the circuit configuration remains unchanged, will the resulting current function \\\\( I(t) \\\\) in the time domain be directly dependent on the initial applied voltage function?",
  "Explanation": "Since the voltage directly drives the circuit, the resulting current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is immediately derived from \\\\( V(t) \\\\) through the impedance function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the transformed domain. Thus, the current is directly dependent on the voltage applied, following the relationship \\\\( I(s) = V(s) / Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain and transforming back to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) in the time domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
