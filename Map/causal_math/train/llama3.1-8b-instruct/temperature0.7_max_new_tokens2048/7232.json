  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) under the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). Here, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nIf the transformed function after intervention is \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\), can we determine the exact values of both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\) from \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The expression \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega - a} \\\\) clearly specifies both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as the imaginary part of the composite term and \\\\( a \\\\) as the real part shift, uniquely identifying both parameters from the modified transformed function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
