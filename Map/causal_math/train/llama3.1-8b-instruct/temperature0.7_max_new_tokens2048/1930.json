  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nKnowing the function result \\\\( h(z(T)) \\\\), can the original integration parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be determined at T without knowing the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z^2 \\\\) changes both the modulus and argument of the original integral result, making it non-trivial to extract the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) accurately without knowing that the squaring transformation has been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
