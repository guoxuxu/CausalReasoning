  "Problem": "Consider a model where the temperature change in a material over time is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source is introduced via a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function representing the heat input.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at some time T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under the heat equation without \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) changes the initial temperature distribution by adding heat from the external source. This alteration in the initial condition will affect the temperature distribution throughout the process, resulting in a different state at time T compared to an evolution without \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
