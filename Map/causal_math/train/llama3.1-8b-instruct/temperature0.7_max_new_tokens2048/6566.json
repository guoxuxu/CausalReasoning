  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a real scalar and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex number value. We apply continuous linear transformations \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex number, to this function over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state of the system at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), can we determine whether the initial state was subject to the transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone, which might be any complex number, without knowledge of \\\\(c\\\\) or the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\), does not allow us to uniquely determine whether the transformation \\\\(f(z) = cz\\\\) was applied or not. Multiple \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(z_0\\\\) combinations can result in the same end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
