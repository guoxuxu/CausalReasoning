  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time, under the influence of a transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation represented by \\\\( S(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) introduces a new influence on the trajectory, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both A and B. The effects of A and B accumulate and might interfere, leading to a different endpoint than if only A (or B) was considered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
