  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is then transformed using a Fourier Transform to analyze its frequency components over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of the modified function \\\\( z(t) = \\alpha e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), can we determine both the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier Transform will clearly show the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) due to the delta function, it does not provide information about the amplitude of the original function, thus the scaling factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the Fourier Spectrum alone. This results in ambiguity in fully reconstructing the interventions made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
