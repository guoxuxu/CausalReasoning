  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real number representing frequency. Evaluate the transformation by applying the Laplace transform to z(t).\n\nGiven the output of the transformed system, can we uniquely identify whether a scaling intervention was applied to the original function or its transformed counterpart?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional constraints or information, determining the point of intervention \\u2014 whether scaling was applied before or after transformation \\u2014 is indistinguishable in the outcome. Both approaches are mathematically equivalent under the linear framework of Laplace transforms, resulting in the same final transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Scaling intervention → Frequency ω; Frequency ω → z(t); z(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → Output"
