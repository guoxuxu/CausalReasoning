  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) ds \\), representing the output of a linear time-invariant system with state-space matrices A and B, and input \\( u(t) \\). Let's explore how the introduction of a transformation \\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\), where C and D are constant matrices, affects the system.\n\nAfter observing the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), is it possible to specifically determine the interventions applied (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(t) \\), or both), solely based on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential complexities and nonlinearities in the matrix exponentials and the system response, multiple interventions could lead to a similar outcome. Therefore, without clear isolated observations or additional data about the dynamics and interactions of interventions, uniquely determining which interventions were involved based on \\( z(T) \\) is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
