  "Problem": "Imagine a functional transformation governed by the integral operator \\\\( L[\\\\varphi(x)] = \\\\int_{0}^\\\\infty K(t, x) \\\\varphi(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( K(t, x) \\\\) is a specific kernel function and \\\\( \\\\varphi(x) \\\\) represents the initial density. We are assessing how initial alterations, involving a complex function \\\\( f(x) = e^{ax} \\\\), where a is a complex number, and subsequent transformations impact this system.\n\nGiven the final observed output of \\\\( L[\\\\varphi(x)] \\\\), can we deduce which transformations (\\\\( f(x) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x) \\\\)) or both were applied to \\\\( \\\\varphi(x) \\\\) before undergoing the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\( L[\\\\varphi(x)] \\\\) resulting from complex exponential transformations and an integral operator could result from various combinations of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or even other transformations. Without definitive knowledge of the transformations' parameters and how they interact within the integral, it is infeasible to uniquely backtrack to the exact interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
