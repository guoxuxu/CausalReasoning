  "Problem": "Consider the process of heat transfer in a one-dimensional metal rod subject to external temperature effects. The change in temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of the rod over time t and position x is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\nIf an initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is set to \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and left to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution at a later time T, \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), be predictable solely by solving the heat equation starting from \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation is deterministic and linear, meaning that any future state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) can be precisely calculated by solving the equation starting from the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without any external intervention or additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
