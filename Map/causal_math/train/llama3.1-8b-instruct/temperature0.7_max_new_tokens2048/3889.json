  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function to analyze is \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number. The transformations are evaluated for their effect on the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\) over a variable \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then evolves according to the function without further intervention, will the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was not transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) alters both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\). Depending on the real and imaginary components of \\\\( a \\\\), the magnitude (and phase) will evolve differently from the original dynamic where \\\\( z \\\\) was simply retained as \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
