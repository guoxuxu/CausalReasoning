  "Problem": "Considering a signal processing scenario where a continuous-time signal \\( x(t) \\) undergoes a Fourier transform to produce \\( X(f) \\), and then a filter characterized by a function \\( H(f) \\) is applied to \\( X(f) \\).\n\nIf an additional filtering process described by \\( G(f) \\) is applied as an intervention before \\( H(f) \\), will the output \\( y(t) \\) be determined solely by the original filter \\( H(f) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new filter \\( G(f) \\) modifies the spectrum \\( X(f) \\) before \\( H(f) \\) is applied. The output \\( y(t) \\) therefore depends on both \\( G(f) \\) and \\( H(f) \\). The combined effect of these filters shapes the final signal, indicating dependence on both filters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
