  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real numbers and represent the real and imaginary components of the exponent, respectively. The transformation is studied in the context of its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+2iB)t} \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system evolves to time T, will the peak of the Fourier Transform still occur at the same \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the imaginary component of the exponent from \\\\( iB \\\\) to \\\\( 2iB \\\\). This shifts the peak of the Fourier Transform from \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega = 2B \\\\), indicating a different frequency component dominating the transformation post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
