  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the consequences of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over a time period [0,T].\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine precisely which transformations or operations (whether original, Fourier, or Laplace) were applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely based on the result at T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the inherent transformation properties of both Fourier and Laplace transforms and their potential overlapping impacts on the system, the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at T does not provide sufficient information to uniquely identify which transformations were applied. Diverse operational sequences could lead to the same spectral output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
