  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and the function evolves over time t. We investigate how transformations involving the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function affect computations and inferences.\n\nIf an additional phase shift by \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is introduced at a specific time T, will the result of applying \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( z(T) = e^{i(\\omega T + \\phi)} \\\\) and then calculating the inverse transform at time T still replicate the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) correctly?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention caused by introducing a phase shift alters the characteristics of the function, thus the final function post-inversion will replicate the new state with the phase shift, not the original state solely based on \\\\( \\omega t \\\\). Therefore, the causal input has changed the resultant function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
