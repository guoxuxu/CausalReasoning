  "Problem": "Consider a system where the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the system's behavior under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nGiven the spectral representation \\\\( Z(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to deduce the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) accurately without knowing whether the Fourier transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation alters the state by converting it into the frequency domain. Without knowledge of the initial application of \\\\( F(z) \\\\), back-transforming \\\\( Z(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) might not accurately restore \\\\( z(0) \\\\) due to potential losses or changes during the transformation and subsequent dynamical evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
