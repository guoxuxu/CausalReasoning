  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space defined over the complex plane and explore the effects of complex function transformations based on the function \\\\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\\\), where \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of this transformation on another function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) defined in the same space that evolves under an integral transformation \\\\(H(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\\\).\n\nIf we observe the output \\\\(H(z)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce unequivocally whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied to \\\\(h(z)\\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the presence or nature of the transformation applied at the beginning (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was used or not), and considering the nontrivial interaction between the complex function transformation and the integral transformation, it is inherently ambiguous which function was initially transformed to arrive at the observed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
