  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, which follows the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), with \\\\( C \\\\) being a complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied over a time period \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf the initial conditions of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) evolve naturally according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without any transformation, will the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied continuously from t=0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) involves an integration over time, which accumulates values differently than mere evolution via \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) does. Thus, the processes yield different outcomes at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
