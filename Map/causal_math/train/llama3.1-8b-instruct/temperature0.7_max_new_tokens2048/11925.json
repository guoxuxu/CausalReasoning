  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nHaving the knowledge of the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to definitively conclude whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without further data?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( T(t) \\\\) does not disclose whether the initial temperature was originally \\\\( T(0) \\\\) or \\\\( T(0) + h \\\\). The information about whether an intervention occurred is lost as the exponential decay smoothens out initial differences over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
