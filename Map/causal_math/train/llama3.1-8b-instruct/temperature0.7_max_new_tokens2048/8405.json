  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relations in a linear system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We then consider the impact of invoking transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) on vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and on the time evolution described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) using \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), we modify the initial condition of the system to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\). The evolution will proceed from this different initial state, and depending on the properties of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may not coincide with that obtained by direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
