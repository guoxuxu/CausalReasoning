  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L u \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( F^{-1} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and not affected by the initial application of \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( F^{-1} \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) attempts to revert the system state back to a space similar to its natural configuration under \\\\( L \\\\), but any transformations or evolutions that happened between \\\\( t=0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) under the disturbed state (post-initial \\\\( F \\\\)) will impact the system's trajectory subsequently. Thus, the state at \\\\( T \\\\) is affected by both initial and midway manipulations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
