  "Problem": "A continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) on the complex plane follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number. Let us consider the influence of a transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we identify which transformations were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) based only on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of applications of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) along with the inherent dynamics governed by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). Without distinct information regarding when and which transformations were applied, the exact pathway leading to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remains obscured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
