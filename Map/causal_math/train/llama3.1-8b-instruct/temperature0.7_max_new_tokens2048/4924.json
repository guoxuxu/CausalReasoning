  "Problem": "Analyze a vector field transformation under the system \\\\( \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. The transformation in question is defined by the mapping \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) = P\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where P is another constant matrix and affects the vector \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\) at time t=0.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\), \\\\( k(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\), or both), merely by examining the state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(T) \\\\) is ambiguous. The effects of transformations \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) can overlap or obscure each other, making the direct pinpointing of interventions challenging due to the interaction of their respective matrix properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
