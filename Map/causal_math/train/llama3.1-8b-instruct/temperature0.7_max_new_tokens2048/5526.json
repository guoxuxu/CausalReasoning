  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the consequences of applying a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), where \\\\( Mz = az + b \\\\), with \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) being complex numbers.\n\nAfter observing the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( M \\\\), it is impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because both the scaling and shifting parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( M \\\\) could have altered the initial conditions in ways that cannot be uniquely reversed solely based on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
