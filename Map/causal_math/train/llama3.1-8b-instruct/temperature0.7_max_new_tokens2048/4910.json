  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a complex exponential function. This function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is mapped through a complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer. We explore the dynamics of this transformation over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) = (e^{iT})^n \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can you directly determine the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for any \\\\( t \\\\) before \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing that \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation used only raises \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) to the nth power and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is known to be \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), one can calculate back from any output at time \\\\( T \\\\) to any earlier state by noting that \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
