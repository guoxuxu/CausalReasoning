  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of values and timings for \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\) could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the multiplicative nature of the exponential functions, making it challenging to deduce the interventions precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
