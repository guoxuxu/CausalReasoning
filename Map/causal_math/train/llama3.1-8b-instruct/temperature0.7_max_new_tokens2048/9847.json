  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The impact of this transformation is studied over the path of the unit circle in the complex plane, described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\in [0, 2\\\\pi] \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\) as an intervention, will the resulting path depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not on \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares each point on the circle, resulting in a shorter period of traversal (completing a full loop in \\\\( \\\\pi \\\\) time units instead of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\)). Applying \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) before \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and then evolving could impact the specific points and their sequencing on the unit circle due to initial direction modification, hence affecting the subsequent transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
