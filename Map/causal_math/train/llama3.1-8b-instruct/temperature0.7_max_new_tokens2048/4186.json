  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nGiven the output z from the transformed matrix \\\\( \\\\lambda S \\\\), can we deduce the initial input x without knowing the scalar \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) used on S?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scalar \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), we cannot accurately determine the structural impact it had on the matrix S, making it impossible to uniquely derive the input x from the output z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
