  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal frequency. The transformation applied is a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed using the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the resulting spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) exhibit a delta function at the original signal's frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) directly results in a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(\\\\omega - \\\\omega') \\\\) centered at the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This is a fundamental property of the Fourier transform, indicating perfect correspondence between the frequency of original signal and its spectral representation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
