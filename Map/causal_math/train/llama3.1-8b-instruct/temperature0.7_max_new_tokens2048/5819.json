  "Problem": "Consider a transformation process where an initial function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[v](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2 + sx} v(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We analyze the causal inference between the input function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) and the transformed function \\\\( w(x) = T[v](x) \\\\) under various scenarios.\n\nIf a different transformation \\\\( U[v](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2/s} v(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention during the transformation process, will the final output \\\\( w(x) \\\\) still be a simple Gaussian integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new transformation \\\\( U \\\\) alters the nature of the integral affecting how \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is processed. Since \\\\( U \\\\) has a distinct kernel involving a varied Gaussian parameter, it modifies how the input is integrated and changes the mathematical characteristics of the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
