  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real variables and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze how the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{zt} dz \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter, affects the output.\n\nGiven the outcome of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can you determine the specific \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) values used in \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation through the integral and the exponential factor introduces multiple potential combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) that can yield the same integrated result, especially considering the complex square terms and the non-invertibility of the integral transformation in a straightforward way.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
