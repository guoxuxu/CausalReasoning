  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nIf during transformation, the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at some point, will this impact the ultimate transformation result \\\\( G(s) \\\\) obtained?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( t^n \\\\) changes the initial function to \\\\( t^n e^{at} \\\\), which significantly alters the Laplace Transform result. The transformed function will now involve higher order terms in s, specifically relating to the derivatives of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), thus giving \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
