  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We explore the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) solely from the Fourier transformed state \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\(F(u)\\\\) was applied at the onset or later?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether or when the Fourier transform was applied, the deduced initial conditions can vary because the Fourier transformation can either pre-exist or be part of the evolving equation, impacting the frequency components in ways that are not reversible purely based on the transformed state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
