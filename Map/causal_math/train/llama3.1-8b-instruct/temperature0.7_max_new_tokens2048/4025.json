  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant system represented by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), where \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function and \\( X(s) \\) is the input in the s-domain. Consider the effect of an additive control intervention \\( u(t) \\) on the system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( U(s) \\). The modified system output is \\( Y(s) = H(s)(X(s) + U(s)) \\).\n\nIf \\( X(s) \\) is set, and the system evolves without any control intervention \\( u(t) \\), will \\( Y(s) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) be equal to \\( H(s)X(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, the system output \\( Y(s) \\) is governed solely by \\( X(s) \\) and the system's transfer function \\( H(s) \\). Therefore, the output will be exactly \\( H(s)X(s) \\), as the intervention \\( U(s) \\) is zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
