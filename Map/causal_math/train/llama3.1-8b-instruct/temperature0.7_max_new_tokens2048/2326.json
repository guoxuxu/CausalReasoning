  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze how different scenarios involving the Laplace transformation affect the interpretation of the function and its inverse.\n\nCan we determine the form of the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) solely from its Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), provided \\\\( F(s) \\\\) pertains specifically to \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) is uniquely determined for functions for which the transform exists, knowing the transform allows one to uniquely determine the inverse, recovering \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The properties of the Laplace transform enable this unique inversion for standard functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transformation → form of F(s); function f(z) → Laplace transformation; z → function f(z); F(s) → inverse Laplace transformation; inverse Laplace transformation → function f(z); s → Laplace transformation; s → F(s); s → inverse Laplace transformation"
