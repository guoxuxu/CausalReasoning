  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. This function models the summative effects of two evolving systems on a complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) is suddenly changed to another vector \\\\( y'' \\\\) as an intervention, does this change the overall expression of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to be dependent only on \\\\( y'' \\\\) and not on its original state?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the later values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t >= t_1 \\\\) solely in the \\\\( e^{Bt}y \\\\) component. However, the history from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the impact of \\\\( x \\\\) still substantially influence \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent on both the original and intervened states of \\\\( y \\\\), as well as \\\\( x \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
