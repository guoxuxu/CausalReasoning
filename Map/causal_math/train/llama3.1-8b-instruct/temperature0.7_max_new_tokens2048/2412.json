  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite knowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) might result in the same endpoint due to the periodic nature of rotations in the complex plane. This non-uniqueness prevents precise determination of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
