  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nFrom the final calculated result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can we determine exactly when and how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was modified during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Although we can hint at changes in \\\\( T(z) \\\\) due to different contributions within the interval, precisely detecting the time and nature of modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is unfeasible without additional information about either the nature or timing of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
