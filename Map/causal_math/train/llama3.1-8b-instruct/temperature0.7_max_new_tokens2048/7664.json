  "Problem": "Consider that velocity \\\\( v \\\\) of a particle moving in a one-dimensional space is governed by the equation \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of an integral transform \\\\( I(x) = \\\\int x e^{-\\\\lambda t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is also a constant, applied to the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of the particle.\n\nGiven the velocity \\\\( v(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( I(x) \\\\), \\\\( J(x) \\\\), or both), just by knowing the velocity at \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions and initial conditions might lead to the same velocity at time \\\\( T \\\\). The transformations with \\\\( I(x) \\\\) and \\\\( J(x) \\\\) contribute multiple possible trajectories that yield similar final velocities, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack and identify which transformations or interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
