  "Problem": "Let's explore a scenario involving a Laplace transform used to solve an initial value problem described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 \\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the behavior of the solution subject to modifications by the transform \\( T(y) = y e^{kt} \\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) an intervention in the form of a function \\( S(y) = y e^{mt} \\) (where m is a different constant) is applied, will the endpoint \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) solely depend on the original parameters p and q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( S(y) \\) introduces an additional modifying factor, transforming the state of the system again with an exponential term dependent on m. This makes the final state \\( y(T) \\) dependent not only on the parameters p and q but also significantly on k (from the initial transformation) and m (from the intervention).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
