  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve over time governed by a system of coupled linear differential equations. The system is represented by \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the influence of the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\) on causal inference between \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\(t_1\\) where a new function \\(h(z) = Qz\\) (Q is a constant matrix) changes the trajectory, will the state \\( z(T) \\) at \\(T > t_1\\) depend solely on \\(M\\) and not on the intervening transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\(h(z) = Qz\\) introduces a new matrix dynamical influence over the system, effectively altering the trajectory of \\(z(t)\\) starting from \\(t_1\\) onwards. The final state \\(z(T)\\) thus depends on the interplay between \\(M\\) and \\(Q\\), and not just on \\(M\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
