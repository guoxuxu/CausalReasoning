  "Problem": "Consider the field of Complex Functions and Integral Transforms, specifically focusing on the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The initial function is \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined for \\\\( t \\\\geq 0 \\\\). Suppose we apply the Laplace Transform to derive \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), and examine scenarios where various operations or interventions are applied, such as modifying the function or applying inverse transformations.\n\nGiven the transformation result \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we determine if during its formation an exponential damping \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) was applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "While the exponential factor shifts the domain, multiple functions or combinations might result in the same resulted transform due to properties of the Laplace transform. Specifically, if \\\\( F(s) \\\\) already incorporates exponential behaviors or parallels another transform with a similar shift, definitive identification of the specific intervention (like the exponential damping) applied is not reliably possible without more context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
