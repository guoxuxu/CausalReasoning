  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model in which the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) is used to transform a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) into a complex function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) of a complex variable \\\\(s\\\\). We then apply an inverse Laplace transform to retrieve \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nIf an operator \\\\(G(s)\\\\) is applied to modify \\\\(F(s)\\\\) into \\\\(G(s)F(s)\\\\) and the result is then subjected to the inverse transform, will the outcome solely depend on the initial function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and not on \\\\(G(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\(F(s)\\\\) by \\\\(G(s)\\\\) before applying the inverse transform alters the resultant time-dependent function, meaning it depends on both \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and the nature of \\\\(G(s)\\\\). This introduces a dependency on the modification operator \\\\(G(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
