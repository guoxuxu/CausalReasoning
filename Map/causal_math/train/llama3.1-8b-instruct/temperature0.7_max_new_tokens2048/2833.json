  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with respect to its behavior modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = f(t) \\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace transform of the differential equation is considered to see the change in the solution's domain from time to frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the transformed equation is solved without further intervention, will the inverse transform of the solution reflect the same general solution as the original differential equation without using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) converts the differential equation into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain. This transformation changes the nature of the solution, which after inverting back to the time domain might not match the general solution of the original differential equation if constants of integration or specific boundary conditions are not preserved exactly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "f(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → transformed equation; \n  p → transformed equation; q → transformed equation; \n  transformed equation → inverse transform; \n  inverse transform → general solution; \n  general solution → same as original solution"
