  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( f(z) \\) defined on the complex plane where \\( f(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z^t \\, dt \\), and \\( s \\) is a fixed complex number. The transformation \\( g(z) = z^s \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z \\).\n\nGiven the outcome of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we accurately state which transformations were applied (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both) solely based on the output of \\( f \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\( g(z) = z^s \\) and \\( h(z) = z + c \\) both affect the calculation path of \\( f(z) \\) and can produce overlapping effects in the complex domain, making it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions from the result. The non-linear interference of these transformations complicates the backward deduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
