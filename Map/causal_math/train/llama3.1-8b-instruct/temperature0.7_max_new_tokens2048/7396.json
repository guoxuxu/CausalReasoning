  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) representing a wave at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\). Analyze the influence of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nGiven the observed transformation result as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha + \\beta - i \\omega} \\\\), can it be precisely determined that two separate interventions (each applying decay functions \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-\\beta t} \\\\)) were used?",
  "Explanation": "While it is clear that a compound exponential decay impacted the waveform, it is inherently ambiguous whether this was due to two separate interventions or a single intervention with a combined effect equivalent to \\\\( \\alpha + \\beta \\\\). The transform alone cannot differentiate between these scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
