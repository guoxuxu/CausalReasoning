  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral in the complex plane. We will evaluate the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{C} e^{zt}dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a closed path and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real number parameter. The analysis is affected by transformations using the function \\\\( f(z) = z^{2} + a \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the computed value of \\\\( I \\\\) after such interventions, can we uniquely determine how the contour was altered by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both based solely on the value of \\\\( I \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same integral result can often be produced by multiple different paths or transformations due to the integral's properties and the potential overlap in effects caused by different transformations. It's not possible to conclusively backtrack to the specific interventions made based solely on the integral outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
