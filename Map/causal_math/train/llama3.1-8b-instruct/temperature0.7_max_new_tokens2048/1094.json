  "Problem": "Analyze the impact/casual inference of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to a continuous-time signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then investigating how the convolution of the resulting function with another function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain affects the original signal domain via the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the described process, can we definitively identify the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( h(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( h(s) \\\\), it is mathematically infeasible to uniquely back-calculate \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) due to the convolution operation in the Laplace domain. Multiple pairs of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(s) \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( y(t) \\\\), making it impossible to ascertain the original signal uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
