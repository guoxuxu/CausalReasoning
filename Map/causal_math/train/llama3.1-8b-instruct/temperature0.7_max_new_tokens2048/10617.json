  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where z is a complex-valued function of a real variable t, and A is a constant complex square matrix. We evaluate causal relationships and transformations involving the perturbation function \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant complex matrix.\n\nWill the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be notably changed at T if initially, at t = 0, we apply the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to z_0 compared to the case where the initial condition is just z_0 without any transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) to the initial condition alters z_0 to \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\). The resulting trajectory will be \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}(Cz_0) \\\\) which in general differs from \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) because of the matrix multiplication with C, ultimately influencing the system's evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
