  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}x(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 still purely depend on the initial function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and matrix A, disregarding matrices B and C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new transformation, adding another layer of complexity. The endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will now depend on how the transformations \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) altered \\\\( x(t) \\\\) along with the effects dictated by A. This influences the entire integration process from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
