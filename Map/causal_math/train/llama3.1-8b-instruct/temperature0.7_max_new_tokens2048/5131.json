  "Problem": "We consider a linear system transformed by applying a Fourier Transform to its input signal \\(x(t)\\), resulting in \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\). Let the system be characterized by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, and the output given by \\(y(t)\\) is also transformed, \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied whereby a new function \\(h(t) = e^{Dt}x(t)\\) (where \\(D\\) is another constant matrix) transforms the input at a certain time \\(t_1\\), will \\(Y(ω)\\) at any \\(\\omega\\) depend only on \\(K\\) and not on \\(D\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the function \\(h(t)\\) alters the input by adding exponential dynamics governed by \\(D\\). Since the Fourier Transform and the system are linear, the output \\(Y(ω)\\) will reflect effects from both \\(K\\) and \\(D\\), showing dependencies on how both transformations (caused by \\(K\\) and \\(D\\)) act on the input \\(x(t)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
