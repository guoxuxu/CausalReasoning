  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where z(t) is a complex-valued function and s is a complex number. This integral transformation is used to analyze the behavior of z(t) in the frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine precisely which interventions (out of transformations by B or A) were applied to obtain the endpoint \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at s=B, given only the final form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-B} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The specific form of \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s-B} \\\\) pinpoints that the intervention applied was the transformation with the constant B, directly indicating the cause from its unique effect. Other interventions would produce differently structured transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
