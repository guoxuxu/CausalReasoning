  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), can we determine if a specific intervention involving a different Fourier Transform parameter occurred, solely based on \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) can arise from diverse interventions involving different parameters or combinations of parameters. The overlapping influence and potential similarity in spectral characteristics between different transforms make it challenging to pinpoint exactly what intervention was implemented.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
