  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z = g(x) \\\\) that maps a real variable x into the complex plane and a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lf = f'' + af' + bf \\\\), where a and b are real constants. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int e^{sx} f(x) dx \\\\), with a complex variable s, on the differentiability and behavior of this expression over time.\n\nGiven the transformed expression \\\\( T(Mg)(s) \\\\) at some endpoint, can we determine explicitly whether only \\\\( M \\\\), only \\\\( L \\\\), or both were applied to \\\\( g \\\\) before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The complexities introduced by combining differential operations with the integral transformation cause overlaps in potential effects on \\\\( g \\\\). This overlap can obscure unique identifiers of the operators used (\\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both), especially without additional contextual information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
