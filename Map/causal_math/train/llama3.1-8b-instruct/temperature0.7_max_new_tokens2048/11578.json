  "Problem": "Consider a control system influenced by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the scenario under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) applied at time t, with S also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) after observing the system is given, can we determine the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\), the uncertainty about the initial transformation makes it impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The possible alteration by S, if unknown, introduces ambiguities in reversing the evolution under M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
