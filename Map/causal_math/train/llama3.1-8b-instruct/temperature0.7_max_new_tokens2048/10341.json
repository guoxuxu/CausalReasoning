  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = f(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time and solve the integral equations \\\\( x(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)}g(x(s)) ds \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}h(y(s)) ds \\\\). We will analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( Tz = Cz \\\\) at different points in time.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( C \\\\) to initially transform both \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) and let the system evolve without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( C \\\\) will impact how both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve from their respective integral equations, as they factor into the definition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not only depend on the functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(y) \\\\) but also the transformation matrix \\\\( C \\\\).",
