  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. To study its behavior, we introduce an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) of the function.\n\nIf the initial condition for \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is given and no intervention is applied, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) reflect only the native dynamics dictated by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral transformation, such as the Laplace transform, faithfully represents the entire history and dynamics governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), the transformed output will purely reflect the system driven by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) under the given initial condition without any external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
