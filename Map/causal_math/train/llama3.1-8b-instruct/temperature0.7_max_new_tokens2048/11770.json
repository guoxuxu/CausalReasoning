  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. The function is initially transformed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\mu t} u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is a constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) adds another exponential modifying factor to the system dynamics. As a result, the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) along with the thermal diffusivity \\\\( k \\\\). The transformations due to \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\mu t} \\\\) can independently and collectively alter how the temperature evolves, affecting the final state at T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
