  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}\\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a function of real variable t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves naturally without any external intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), for t > 0, solely depend on the parameter A?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} e^{At} dt \\\\) simplifies to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\), displaying a dependency only on A. Since there are no additional transformations or external factors applied, the transform outcome is determined exclusively by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
