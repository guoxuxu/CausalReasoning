  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex vector. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-iB\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) applied at time t, with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at t = T, without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces changes that depend on the integral of the state's history modified by \\\\( e^{-iB\\\\tau} \\\\). This integrated effect cannot be simply reversed or deduced from the state at t=T alone, making it difficult to trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
