  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex variable. We explore the effect of modifying the system using a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), transforming the original to \\\\( y'(t) = (y * h)(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\), the transformed Laplace transform, can we precisely determine \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) if we do not know \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\), one cannot uniquely determine \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) from \\\\( Y'(s) = Y(s)H(s) \\\\) because any number of functions \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) can produce the same product, making it indeterminate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
