  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the charge \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) on a capacitor evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{Q} = -\\\\frac{Q}{RC} + I(t) \\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is an external current source. We examine the impact of modifying the circuit by changing the resistance to a new value \\\\( R' \\\\) at time t.\n\nCan we infer the initial resistance \\\\( R \\\\) used in the circuit by measuring \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) at some later time t without knowing if the resistance was changed at some point?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and when the resistance was changed, the measurements of \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) alone might not reflect the initial resistance directly due to the unknown impact of a possible resistance change at some unknown time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
