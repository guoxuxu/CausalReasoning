  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system represents a basic integral transformation with a complex exponential kernel. We investigate the influence of a matrix multiplier \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying another matrix \\\\( N \\\\) at time \\\\( t = t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be determined exclusively by the initial function without considering the effects of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) alter the trajectory at different times leading to a final state at \\\\( T \\\\) that depends on both the initial function and the successive modifications made by these matrix operations. Each operation potentially changes the magnitude and direction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
