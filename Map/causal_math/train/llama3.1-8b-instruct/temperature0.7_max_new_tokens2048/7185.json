  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the solution to the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\), and K is a constant matrix. Explore the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at various times, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0, followed by the system's evolution according to \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( w_0 \\\\) was evolved to time T under \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(w) \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial conditions due to the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). This transformation modifies the trajectory of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) even before considering its complex enveloping through \\\\( e^{it} \\\\. Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ because the trajectories of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) have been altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
