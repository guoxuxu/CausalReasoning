  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations defined by \\(\\dot{z} = Cz\\), where \\(z \\in \\mathbb{C}^n\\) and \\(C\\) is a complex matrix. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\\) applied at a certain time.\n\nCan we reliably identify the sequence or nature of interventions (original Fourier transform or the second one) purely from observing \\(z(T)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and overlap in effects from multiple Fourier transforms and the complex matrix exponentials, different initial conditions and interventions could potentially lead to the same final state \\(z(T)\\). This ambiguity obstructs reliable identification of specific interventions from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
