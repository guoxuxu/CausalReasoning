  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where T is a specific time point greater than zero.\n\nKnowing only the output at time T, can we determine which transformations between \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) were applied, and in what order?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potential for overlapping effects due to the exponential nature of the transformations and their ability to alter the state in complex ways, it is impossible to uniquely dissect and attribute the final observed state at time T to specific transformations and their order, especially without additional information on parameter values of A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
