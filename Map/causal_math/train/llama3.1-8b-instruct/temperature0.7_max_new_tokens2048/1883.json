  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ay \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in testing the effects of applying a complex integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is made at time T, will the future state of the system for any time T' > T depend solely on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with another transformation, \\\\( g(z) \\\\), would introduce additional effects on the system's trajectory after T, thereby making the future state dependent on A, B, and C. The effects of these matrix exponentials are compounded and cannot be separated, affecting the trajectory and final state at T'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
