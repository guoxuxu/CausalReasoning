  "Problem": "We explore a physical system where a beam is subjected to various forces over time. The forces are represented as functions of time, \\( f(t) \\), acting at different points on the beam. Fourier transforms of these functions (\\( F(\\omega) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency) are used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. The structural integrity response of the beam, \\( R(\\omega) \\), depends on these inputs.\n\nBased on a measured response \\( R(\\omega_1) \\) at frequency \\( \\omega_1 \\), can we conclusively infer the exact form of \\( f(t) \\) that was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without other information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, \\( F(\\omega) \\), of a temporal force function \\( f(t) \\) provides frequency components, but multiple temporal functions can lead to similar frequency responses. The inverse transformation from \\( R(\\omega_1) \\) does not uniquely specify \\( f(t) \\), especially without knowing the phase information and potential contributions from other forces.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
