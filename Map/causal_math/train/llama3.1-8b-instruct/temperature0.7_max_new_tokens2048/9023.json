  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a set of complex differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We study the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another complex matrix.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\) (where K is another complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on S or K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also on S and K. The details of how these matrices relate and potentially non-commute would significantly influence the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
