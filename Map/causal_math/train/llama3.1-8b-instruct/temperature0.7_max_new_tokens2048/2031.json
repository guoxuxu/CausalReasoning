  "Problem": "Let's consider a mathematical model where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) satisfies the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nAssuming that at some moment \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the potential \\\\( V(x) \\\\) is altered to \\\\( V'(x) \\\\), and the Fourier transform is recalculated, will the evolved wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 still adhere strictly to the original potential \\\\( V(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in potential from \\\\( V(x) \\\\) to \\\\( V'(x) \\\\) effectively modifies the Schrödinger equation governing \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\)'s evolution. The Fourier transform does not protect or insulate \\\\(\\\\psi(x, T)\\\\) from these changes; hence, the resulting wave function is influenced by both the original and altered potentials.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
