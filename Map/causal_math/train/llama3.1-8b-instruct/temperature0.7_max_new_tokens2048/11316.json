  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a diagonal matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nCan the specific interventions (application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( T(x) \\\\), or both) be uniquely determined from the knowledge of the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could result from different combinations of the initial condition modified by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and/or the application of the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\). The overlapping effects and potential equivalence in resulting states from different paths preclude a unique determination of past interventions solely based on \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
