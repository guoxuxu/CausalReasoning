  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) which represents the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) applicable over the domain of complex numbers for \\\\( z \\\\). The system's behavior is analyzed by varying the complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) and examining the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2u(z) \\\\).\n\nCan the exact nature of interventions (whether \\\\( z \\\\) was squared, or the exponential \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, or both) be reliably deduced just by analyzing the form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations or interventions solely through the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is challenging due to the overlapping effects of squaring and exponential transformations in the complex domain. Different combinations can yield similar alterations in the resultant function, making it hard to distinguish precisely which operations were performed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
