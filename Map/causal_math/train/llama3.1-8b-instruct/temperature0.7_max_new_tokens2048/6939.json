  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the spectrum \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the transformations by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) introduces modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that also depend on C along with A and B. This adds complexity to the system's dynamics and affects its frequency-domain representation, hence \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at times after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect the influences of A, B, and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
