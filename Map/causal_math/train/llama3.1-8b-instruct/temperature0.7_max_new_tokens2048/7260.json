  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied during the evolution just by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is inherently complex due to the non-commutativity in the phase shifts introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Various scenarios could theoretically result in the same endpoint due to the compounded effects of the phase rotations, making it difficult to deduce exact intervention history from final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
