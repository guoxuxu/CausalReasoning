  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), transforming it into the frequency domain as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), can the exact nature of the intervention (e.g., change to operator \\\\( M \\\\)) be determined conclusively only based on the observed outcome in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the possible variations in how different operators could affect the evolution of \\\\( u \\\\) and ambiguities inherent in reverse-engineering non-trivial differential operators from the frequency outcomes, it is not definite to pinpoint exactly what interventions were used solely based on \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
