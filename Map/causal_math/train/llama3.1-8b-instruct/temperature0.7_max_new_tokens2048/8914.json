  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit where the voltage across the capacitor is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{R}I(t)\\\\), with R being the resistance, C the capacitance, and I(t) a time-varying input current. We analyze the behavior of this system under the function \\\\( g(V) = V + e^{At}\\\\), where A is a constant.\n\nGiven the voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) observed at T, can we determine the initial voltage \\\\( V_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the function \\\\( g(V) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(V) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( V_0 \\\\) because the addition of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) at the beginning could cause identical end states from different initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
