  "Problem": "Consider a space of functions transformed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), where an input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is converted into its Laplacian \\\\(F(s)\\\\). Examining how modifying functions with the multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) affects inference and predictive capabilities in this transformed domain.\n\nIf at some interim point during the observation a new constant \\\\(b\\\\) is introduced, altering the function again to \\\\(e^{bt} (e^{at} f(t))\\\\), does the resultant Laplace Transform remain similar to some shifted version of \\\\(F(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional exponential factor \\\\(e^{bt}\\\\) results in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(e^{bt} e^{at} f(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{(a+b)t} f(t)) = F(s-(a+b))\\\\). Thus, this demonstrates that the manipulation effectively accumulates, shifting the Laplacian further by \\\\(b\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
