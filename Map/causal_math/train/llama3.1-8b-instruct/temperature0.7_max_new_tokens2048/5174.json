  "Problem": "Let us consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) represents a control input vector. The Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) applied to this system results in \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) + (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\) where \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\) at any \\( s \\), can we uniquely determine the original system's initial state \\( x(0) \\) without knowing the control input \\( U(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\( x(0) \\) from \\( X(s) \\) alone is impossible without explicit knowledge of \\( U(s) \\) because both the initial state and the control input influence \\( X(s) \\). Without knowing \\( U(s) \\), the contribution of \\( (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s) \\) is indeterminable, thus obscuring \\( x(0) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
