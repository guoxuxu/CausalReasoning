  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant frequency. To analyze this, a transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\phi(z) =  \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t)z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is also a real constant, is applied at various times.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( \\\\phi(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the initial transformation \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\theta t) \\\\) alters the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing this, it's impossible to uniquely determine what \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was, as the rotational effect of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) on the trajectory could replicate or obscure various initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
