  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), the output from filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the original time series \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the specific filter used, \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) requires knowledge of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) since deconvolution in the frequency domain depends on dividing \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Without knowing the filter, it is not possible to accurately reverse engineer \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
