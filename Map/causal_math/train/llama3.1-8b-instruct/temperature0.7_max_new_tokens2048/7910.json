  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) and n is a non-negative integer. Let's explore how the convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) affects the outcomes, where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine uniquely whether it originated from the convolution of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without any specific initial detail about \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about \\\\( F(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\), especially their specific forms or parameters, determining the exact precursor functions for \\\\( H(s) \\\\) becomes mathematically infeasible. There could be multiple pairs whose convolution could result in the same \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
