  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\) representing a complex function where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(y) \\\\) are real functions defined in terms of x and y, respectively. Examine the influence of the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants on the evolution of the function over the complex domain.\n\nGiven the complex number \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or combinations of transformations can result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex domain, due to the additive and multiplicative properties of complex numbers in transformations. The overlapping effects and potential equivalence of different transformation sequences create ambiguity in precisely identifying the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
