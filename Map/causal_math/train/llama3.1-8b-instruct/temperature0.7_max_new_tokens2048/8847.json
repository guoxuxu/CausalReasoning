  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a set of complex functions \\\\(z(t) = U(t)z_0\\\\), where \\\\(U(t)\\\\) is a unitary operator that evolves the state \\\\(z_0\\\\) over time t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t V(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is another operator.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new operator \\\\(W(t)\\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original unitary operator \\\\(U(t)\\\\) and not on \\\\(V(s)\\\\) or \\\\(W(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state at endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is affected by the sequence of transformations including the original unitary evolution, the initial application of the integral transform \\\\(T\\\\), and the subsequent intervention with \\\\(W(t)\\\\). Each of these influences the trajectory independently and in combination, therefore the outcome depends on all applied operators.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
