  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the coupled equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The influence of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is analyzed under different scenarios.\n\nIf a modifying function \\\\( h(t) = ue^{vt} \\\\), where u is a constant vector and v is a matrix, is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend solely on A, B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) introduces additional complexity into the system. The final state and thus the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will now depend not only on A, B, C, and D but also on the characteristics of the intervention, specifically the parameters u and v.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
