  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation governed by \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative, \\\\( u_{xx} \\\\) is the spatial second derivative, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we reliably determine the original condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation could be applied initially, and considering the decay of \\\\( e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\), determining \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is not possible without additional information. The transformation modifies the initial condition, and its effects decrease over time, blending indistinguishably with the characteristics of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at later times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
