  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nGiven a system's displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine whether the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was zero without knowing the values of m, c, and k?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the values of m, c, and k, it's impossible to backtrack accurately and determine the specific initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) just from observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The system's behavior can be similarly expressed under different parameter combinations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
