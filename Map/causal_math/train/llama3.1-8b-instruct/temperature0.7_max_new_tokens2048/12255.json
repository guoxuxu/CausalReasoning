  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyze how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nAssuming the final observed Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether the function was altered by the intervention \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + h \\\\) or not, just by observing the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of adding a constant \\\\( h \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its interplay with \\\\( i \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) can manifest in ways that may appear similar to natural evolution under certain conditions in the transform space. Hence, it's not possible to uniquely identify the intervention from the Laplace transform alone without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
