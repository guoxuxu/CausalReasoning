  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a step function. We apply the Laplace transform to this signal and analyze various influence scenarios within the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf an additional frequency component \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) is introduced at time \\\\(t = T > 0\\\\), modifying \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to \\\\(z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\delta)t}u(t)\\\\), does the new Laplace transform reflect only the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) without showing the impact of \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a frequency shift \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) changes the frequency components of the signal, and thus the Laplace transform will embody this change, yielding a transform such as piecewise definitions combining different terms for varying time intervals reflecting both \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\delta\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z; z → u; u → e^(iωt); e^(iωt) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → frequency component; δ → T; T → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → ω; ω → δ → Laplace transform; z → z(t = T); z(t = T) → δ; δ → ω; ω → Laplace transform"
