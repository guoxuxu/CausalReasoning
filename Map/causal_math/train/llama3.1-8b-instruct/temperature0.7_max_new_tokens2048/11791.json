  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a real number. To analyze causal effects, we introduce interventions using the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we determine exactly what interventions were applied, whether it be \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both, by only analyzing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of interventions (\\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\)) can lead to the same output state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) due to the properties of complex exponentials. This overlap implies that knowing the endpoint alone does not provide sufficient information to definitively identify the nature or sequence of interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
