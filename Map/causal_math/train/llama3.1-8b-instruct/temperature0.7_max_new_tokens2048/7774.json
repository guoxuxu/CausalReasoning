  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a space defined by linear operators. We have the operators \\\\( L \\\\) for differentiation and \\\\( M \\\\) for multiplication by function \\\\( t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the impact of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this setup.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result of \\\\( t^n \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether operator \\\\( M \\\\) or operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied to the original function before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace transform of \\\\( t^n \\\\) will indicate a factorial over a power in the s-domain, but it does not uniquely reveal whether operator \\\\( M \\\\) (multiplication) or \\\\( L \\\\) (differentiation) was applied. The operators influence the function differently but aren't distinguishable solely based on the Laplace transform result unless additional information is provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
