  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(u) = e^{Mt}u\\\\), where M is another linear differential operator, on the evolution of function u over time t.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowledge about whether \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied, we cannot determine whether the observed \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T came from the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) or from \\\\(e^{Mt}u_0\\\\). The transformation \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) could substantially alter initial states, making reverse inference infeasible without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
