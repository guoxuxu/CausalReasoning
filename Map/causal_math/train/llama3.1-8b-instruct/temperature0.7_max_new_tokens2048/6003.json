  "Problem": "Let's consider a time-dependent quantum system governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H(t) = H_0 + V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( H_0 \\\\) is the time-independent part of the Hamiltonian and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent potential. We explore the outcomes of applying unitary transformations defined by \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\) on the state function \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a time-independent Hamiltonian.\n\nIf, at some time t_1, another transformation \\\\( G(t) = e^{-iCt} \\\\) (where C is another time-independent Hamiltonian) is applied as an intervention, will the final state function \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( H(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( G(t) \\\\) as an intervention introduces new dynamics into the system, compounding the effects of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) with \\\\( H(t) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) will depend on the interplay of all these factors, making the state trajectory reliant on the combined influences of \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( H(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
