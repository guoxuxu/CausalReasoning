  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a two-dimensional domain, and a transformation \\\\( u(x, y) = v(x, y) + g(x, y) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) is a harmonic function (also satisfying the Laplace equation).\n\nIf at a certain location \\\\( (x_1, y_1) \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) to a new harmonic function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\), will the future state of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) on the domain depend only on \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) and not on \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) or \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the state of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\), making it dependent on both \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) and the new harmonic function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\). The effects of any harmonic function, whether \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\), influence the state according to the Laplace equation, impacting the overall solution and distribution across the domain through superposition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
