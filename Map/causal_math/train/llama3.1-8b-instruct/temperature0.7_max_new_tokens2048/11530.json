  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, and its impact when integrated along a path in the complex plane. The study explores how the path of integration, and potential path modifications (interventions), affect the evaluation of the integral.\n\nGiven the integral result of the complex function \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the path taken in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The integral result of an analytic function between two points in the complex plane is path-independent as long as the function remains analytic throughout the domain and there are no singularities between \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_T \\\\). Thus, multiple paths can yield the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
