  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Now introduce a change of basis driven by a matrix function \\\\( P(t) \\\\), leading to a new variable \\\\( y = P(t)x \\\\). Analyze the transformation's impacts under various scenarios.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the interventions (both \\\\( P(t) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) or just one of them) applied during the timeline from 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from numerous combinations of the interventions \\\\( P(t) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) due to the non-unique nature of matrix exponential effects when coupled with layered transformations. Thus, identifying specific interventions just from the endpoint is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
