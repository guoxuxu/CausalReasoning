  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a linear integral transformation defined by \\\\(I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA} f(s) ds\\\\) where A is a constant matrix and f is a vector-valued function. We assess the effect of a function perturbation on the transformed system where \\\\(f(s)\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(g(s) = e^{Bs} f(s)\\\\), with B being another constant matrix.\n\nIf the function \\\\(g(s) = e^{Bs} f(s)\\\\) replaces \\\\(f(s)\\\\) in the integral transformation without further interventions, does \\\\(I[g](t)\\\\) at time T differ from \\\\(I[f](t)\\\\) computed directly using the original \\\\(f(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The perturbation of the input function to \\\\(g(s)\\\\), induced by \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\), modifies the integral formula. Since the transformation by B affects the integrand by a multiplicative factor which depends on s, the output of the integral transformation \\\\(I[g](t)\\\\) will generally differ from \\\\(I[f](t)\\\\) due to the interaction between B and A within the integral expression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
