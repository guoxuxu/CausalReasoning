  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the function over time t.\n\nAfter observing the Laplace Transform \\\\( W(s) \\\\) which arises from the function \\\\( w(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z(t) \\\\), can it be ascertained which transformations (\\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) or \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), or both) were applied to the original function just from \\\\( W(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform \\\\( W(s) \\\\) may show characteristics of both transformations through its poles and exponential decay, but disentangling which effects arise from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) directly from \\\\( W(s) \\\\) without additional context or constraints is not generally feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
