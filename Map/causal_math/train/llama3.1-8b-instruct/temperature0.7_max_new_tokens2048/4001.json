  "Problem": "Consider a complex system where the output \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Lz\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear operator. An integral transformation with kernel \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) defined by \\\\(z_T(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(t, s) z(s) ds\\\\) is applied to the system.\n\nIf \\\\(z(0)\\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\(z_T(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) only and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Lz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at some later time \\\\(T\\\\) necessarily satisfy the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation modifies the initial condition \\\\(z(0)\\\\), potentially altering the subsequent evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from what would have been purely governed by \\\\(L\\\\). Specifically, the transformation \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) alters the influence of the initial state and intermediate values of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), leading to a different trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
