  "Problem": "Consider a response system described by \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. Analyze the impact of a Fourier transform applied to the system's output, where the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed output \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and knowing the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can one retrieve the exact function of the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that was used?",
  "Explanation": "The exact retrieval of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega) \\\\) using only \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is generally not guaranteed without further conditions such as non-zero values of \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) everywhere. There could be frequencies where \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) \\\\) might be zero, leading to potential loss of information about \\\\( \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega) \\\\) at those frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
