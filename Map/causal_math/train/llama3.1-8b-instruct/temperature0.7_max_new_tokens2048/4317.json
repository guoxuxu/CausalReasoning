  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), widely known as the Laplace transform, applied to the function over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the transform's result is inverse transformed without further intervention, will the resulting function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at any time t match the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that the region of convergence includes \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will return \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Laplace transform and its inverse are linear operators and assuming the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is within the transform's capabilities, they should perfectly recreate the original function over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
