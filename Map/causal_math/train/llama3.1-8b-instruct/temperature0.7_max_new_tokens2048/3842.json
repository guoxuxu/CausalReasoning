  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i \\\\omega t}z_0\\\\), where C is a complex constant, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial complex state. We investigate the consequences of an integral transformation on this system, denoted by \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda (t-\\\\tau)} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a decay factor.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) exactly at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\(T_{\\\\lambda}[z](t)\\\\), the decay and modification by the integral transform mask the true initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\), making it indistinguishable based on the end state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
