  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = F(x, y) \\\\) that maps complex numbers \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) to \\\\( z \\\\), defined by \\\\( F(x, y) = x^2 + iy \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( F \\\\) and its derivatives across transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(x, y) = (e^{Ax}x, e^{By}y) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf, after applying \\\\( F \\\\) to \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\), an intervention in the form of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) using different constants \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) is applied at a specific point, will the final result depend only on the original function \\\\( F \\\\) without the effects of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using a new set of constants introduces additional transformations to each variable. These transformations affect the final output exponentially, thus making the end result dependent on both the original and the intervened transformations, reflecting the characteristics of \\\\( A', B' \\\\) as well as \\\\( A, B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
