  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B as constant matrices. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\) applied at different instances.\n\nFrom observing the final Laplace transform result \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\) can we identify the moment and type of intervention (matrix M) applied during the transformation period?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of the Laplace transform, which aggregates the entire history of the function into a single function of s, obscures specific interventions like timing and nature of matrix M, unless additional tracking or external information about the dynamics' changes over time is available.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → x; A → \\dot{x}; B → y; B → \\dot{y}; z(t) → z(s); z(t) → L[z](s); L[z](s) → moment of intervention; L[z](s) → type of intervention; L[z](s) → M"
