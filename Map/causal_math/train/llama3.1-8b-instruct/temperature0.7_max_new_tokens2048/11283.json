  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, and A and B are real constants. This function is used to transform the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} z(t) dt \\\\) affects the output over a period T.\n\nIf during the interval [0, T], another complex transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = e^{(iC + D)t}z \\\\) (where C and D are constants) is applied, will the integration result solely depend on B and D?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the initial dynamics by adding another exponential layer determined by C and D, along with the original dynamics from A and B. Hence, the output of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) will be influenced by a combination of all these parameters, reflecting the compounded effect of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
