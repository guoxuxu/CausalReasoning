  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), with D being a diffusion coefficient. Analyze the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the function at initial time t = 0, namely \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\) is computed for the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then evolved under the given PDE without further intervention, will the transformed function at a later time t = T, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), be equivalent to direct computation of the Fourier transform at t = T (i.e., \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, T)](k) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the Fourier transform of a solution to a linear PDE can be equivalently described by the transformed differential equation, which in this case is \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = -Dk^2 \\\\hat{u} \\\\). Thus, evolving \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\) under this equation would yield the same result as directly transforming \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
