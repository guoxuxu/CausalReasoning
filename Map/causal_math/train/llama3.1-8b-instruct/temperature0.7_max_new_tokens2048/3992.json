  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We explore the function behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[F](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} F(t) dt \\\\) with respect to the Laplace transform when \\\\( F(t) = f(t) \\\\) for t in the complex plane.\n\nKnowing only the Laplace transform result of a function after a squared-time intervention (not knowing the functional form is \\\\( e^{i(t^2)} \\\\)), can we specifically assert that the initial function was \\\\( e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the nature of the intervention (function changed to \\\\( e^{i(t^2)} \\\\)), it's not possible to deduce the initial form was \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) just from the Laplace transform results. The alteration in the functional form significantly changes transformation outcomes and can result from various other functional forms.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
