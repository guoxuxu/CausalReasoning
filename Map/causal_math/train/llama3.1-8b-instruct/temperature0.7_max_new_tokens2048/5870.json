  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a control system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu \\\\) where \\\\(D\\\\) is a dynamics matrix and \\\\(B\\\\) is a control matrix. We study the influence of applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(Cx) \\\\) where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix to the state vector \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), the initial state cannot be uniquely deduced since the sinusoidal transformation can significantly modify the state in uncertain ways, not directly reversible especially considering the dynamic matrix D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
