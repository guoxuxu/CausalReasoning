  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + a \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents a scalar field, and \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant vector. We investigate the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\).\n\nCan we precisely identify which transformations (Fourier, Laplace, or both) were applied at different times based solely on observing the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions (Fourier or Laplace transform, or both) based solely on the later state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is highly challenging. The cumulative effects and possible overlap in the transformative properties of the applied mathematical tools make it difficult to pinpoint the exact sequence or types of interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
