  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(w(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex number. The system is then studied under the transformation, \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t) dt \\\\), an integral transform with parameter \\\\(s\\\\).\n\nIf the transformed output \\\\(g(w)\\\\) at \\\\(s = s_0\\\\) is known, can we precisely determine both the original value \\\\(z_0\\\\) and whether an intervention occurred (like the shift by \\\\(i\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of the transformation and the complex function implies that multiple initial conditions and interventions (shifts in \\\\(z\\\\)) could yield the same or very similar outcomes in \\\\(g(w)\\\\). The integral transformation's smoothing and averaging effects over an infinite range coupled with the complexity of exponential effects of squared terms convolute exact backtrack computation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
