  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and represent the growth rate and oscillation frequency, respectively. The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the system properties.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z_0(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without knowing whether the oscillation component \\\\( e^{bi} \\\\) was included?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the inclusion of the \\\\( e^{bi} \\\\) component, it is impossible to deduce whether the original function was purely exponential growth or included an oscillatory component. The added complexity of the sinusoidal term modifies the Laplace transform in a way that cannot be simply decomposed without further data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
