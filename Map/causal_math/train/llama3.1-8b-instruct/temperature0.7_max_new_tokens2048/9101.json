  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z : \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\) defined by \\\\(z(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\), where \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is a given function and \\\\(w\\\\) is a complex number. We analyze the behavior of this transformation, specifically how it behaves under modifications of \\\\(f(x)\\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is modified to \\\\(af(x)\\\\) for some scalar \\\\(a\\\\), and then \\\\(z(w)\\\\) is computed without further intervention, will the resulting transformation \\\\(z(w)\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was not scaled by \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling \\\\(f(x)\\\\) by \\\\(a\\\\) directly scales the integral, resulting in \\\\(z(w) = a\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{iwx}f(x)\\\\,dx\\\\). This implies a scaling effect on the transform, so the outcome will be scaled by \\\\(a\\\\), not unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
