  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = My\\\\), and M is a constant matrix. We study the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) applied at different instances, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine unambiguously which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(y) \\\\), \\\\( k(y) \\\\), or both) just by analyzing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied on \\\\( y \\\\) based solely on the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated due to the non-commutativity of the exponential operations associated with D and F matrices. Different combinations of these transformations could potentially yield the same end state, therefore making it inherently ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
