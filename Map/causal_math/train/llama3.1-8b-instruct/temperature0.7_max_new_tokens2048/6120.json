  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor (R), an inductor (L), and a capacitor (C) connected in series, described by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = E(t) \\\\), where \\\\( q(t) \\\\) is the charge and \\\\( E(t) \\\\) is an external voltage source. The relationship to be studied involves examining the behavior of this RLC circuit under the transformation of an applied impulse response function denoted as \\\\( F(t) = e^{-st} \\\\).\n\nGiven the charge state \\\\( q(T) \\\\) at a particular time T, can we precisely deduce all interventions applied (whether \\\\( F(t) \\\\), \\\\( G(t) \\\\) or none) only by knowing the value of T and the circuit constants R, L, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed state \\\\( q(T) \\\\) could potentially result from various combinations or magnitudes of intervention due to the superposition of effects in linear dynamical systems. The ambiguity in potential transformations such as those caused by differing s and u values in the impulse responses obscures definite back-tracing of interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
