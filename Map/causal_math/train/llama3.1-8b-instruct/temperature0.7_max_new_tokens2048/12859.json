  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\), is it feasible to distinguish whether the alteration in the system was due to natural evolution under the heat equation or due to the added function \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of additional spectral components in \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) due to \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) makes it unclear whether changes are solely due to the native heat diffusion equation or to the intervention, especially without explicit information about intervention's nature and magnitude.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "g(x, t) → u(x, t); u(x, t) → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → √hat(u(k, T)); √hat(u(k, T)) → system state; system state → distinguish alteration; natural evolution → system state; system state → distinguish alteration"
