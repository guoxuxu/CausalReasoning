  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to examine the system behavior.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we distinctly ascertain which transformations (either \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the system's evolution by solely analyzing the system state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral and exponential nature of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\), and considering their potential non-commutative overlapping effects based on matrices C and D, it's impossible to explicitly determine the exact sequence or type of transformations that led to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
