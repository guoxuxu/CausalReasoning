  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx \\), where M is a constant matrix. Analyze the implications of applying a complex function transformation \\( f(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), is it possible to accurately determine which interventions were applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both) by solely knowing \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( x(T) \\) could potentially be the result of various combinations of interventions due to the complex interactions and non-commutativity of the exponential matrix transformations. Without additional information about the sequence or nature of the interventions, it is not feasible to identify them uniquely from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
