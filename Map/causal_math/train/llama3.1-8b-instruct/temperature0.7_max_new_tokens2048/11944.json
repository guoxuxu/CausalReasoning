  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its effect on the real part of complex numbers. We consider the transformation given by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then transformed by \\\\( T \\\\), does this yield the same result as directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( e^{z_0} \\\\) without modifying \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( T(f(z)) \\\\) of the entire transformation and the function application \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) commutes due to linearity and the specific exponential nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Therefore, applying \\\\( f \\\\) first and then \\\\( T \\\\), or directly applying \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( e^{z_0} \\\\), results in the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
