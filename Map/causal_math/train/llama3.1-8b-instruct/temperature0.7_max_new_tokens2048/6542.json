  "Problem": "Analyzing the system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) applied to the function u(x, t), and how it evolves over time.\n\nCan we accurately reconstruct the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) from its state at \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T, knowing only the evolved Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) without interference?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming that the operator L and its corresponding spectral representation are known and invertible, the initial function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) can be reconstructed from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform and the inverse of the spectral operator applied over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
