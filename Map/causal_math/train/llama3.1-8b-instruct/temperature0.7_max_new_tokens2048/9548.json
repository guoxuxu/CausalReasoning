  "Problem": "We examine a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a second-order differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{z} = -\\\\omega^2 z + \\\\gamma \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) represents an external driving force. We explore the impacts of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the system.\n\nBased on the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied at any point, solely by analyzing the form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multiplicative nature of the exponential factors in both transformations and their influences on the system’s dynamics, multiple combinations of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) values can lead to the same apparent state at T. This results in multiple plausible histories for the state, making it impossible to uniquely determine the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
