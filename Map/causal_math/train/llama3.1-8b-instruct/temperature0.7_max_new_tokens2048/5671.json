  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a time-dependent state of the system. The impact of convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) expressed as \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( k(t) \\\\) is convolved into the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making the new state \\\\( j(t) = (h*k)(t) \\\\), will \\\\( L[j(t)] \\\\) at time T > t_1 still show the influence of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new convolution with \\\\( k(t) \\\\) modifies the state to \\\\( j(t) = (h*k)(t) = ((f*g)*k)(t) \\\\), which in the Laplace domain is represented as \\\\( J(s) = H(s)K(s) = F(s)G(s)K(s) \\\\). The influence of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is preserved and compounded with the effect of \\\\( k(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
