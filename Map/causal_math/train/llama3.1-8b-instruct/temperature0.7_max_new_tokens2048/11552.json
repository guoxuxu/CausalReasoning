  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where an original signal \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). An inverse operation using the inverse Laplace transform is applied as \\\\( f(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\). Additionally, consider a multiplication operator in the complex domain, \\\\( H(s) = sG(s) \\\\), which modifies the transform.\n\nGiven the transformed outcome \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and knowing it involved a multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\), can we determine whether an intermediate transformation to \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) occurred directly from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or via another sequence of transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\( H(s) = sG(s) \\\\) indicates a multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\), but it does not uniquely specify the sequence of transformations that resulted in \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Multiple pathways involving different orders or types of operations could result in the same \\\\( H(s) \\\\), such as direct transformation from a differentiated \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or intermediate steps with varying transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
