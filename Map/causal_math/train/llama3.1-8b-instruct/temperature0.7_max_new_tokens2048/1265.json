  "Problem": "Let's consider the linear functional transformation \\\\( F(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a fixed but unknown function. We explore the consequences of applying \\\\( F(g) \\\\) to different functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) under continuous and piecewise mappings.\n\nIf \\\\( F(g) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and evolved over time without any additional transformations, will the output be affected solely by the properties of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{at} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since there are no interventions, the result is purely the convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), and thus dependent only on these inputs and their interaction during the integration process typical of linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
