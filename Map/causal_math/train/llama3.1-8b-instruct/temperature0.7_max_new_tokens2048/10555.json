  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(t, y) = e^{Ct} y \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t, y) \\\\) introduces an additional layer of transformation, making the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, and C. This dependence arises because the resultant system's output at time T includes contributions from all applied transformations, affecting how the original and intervening transformations integrate over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
