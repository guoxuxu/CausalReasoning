  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a controlled mechanical system whose state variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) as described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Lx + K u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input represented by a function and \\\\( K \\\\) is a constant matrix dictating the influence of \\\\( u \\\\) on the state \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nObserving that the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is scaled by some factor relative to expectations based on initial conditions and known \\\\( u(t) \\\\), can we conclude that the input must have been scaled accordingly throughout the time interval?",
  "Explanation": "Even though linear scaling of the input leads to a proportional scaling of the state output, other factors such as initial conditions or possible external forces unaccounted for could also affect the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Therefore, a scaled state output alone isn't conclusive evidence of a scaled control input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
