  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine the specific initial phase \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) of \\\\( z(0) e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) by observing the system state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the differential equations involves terms that can mix and rotate the effects of x and y nonlinearly, thereby entangling the contributions from the initial values and the phase shift. Without additional information, the precise original phase \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered at later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
