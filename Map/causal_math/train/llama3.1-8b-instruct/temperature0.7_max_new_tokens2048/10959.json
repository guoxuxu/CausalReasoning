  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a rotational motion in the complex plane. We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) applied at time T affects this motion.\n\nIf we adjust the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the value of the function \\\\( H(z) \\\\) at T only reflect the initial \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not the intervened \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) affects the subsequent motion path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and because \\\\( H(z) \\\\) involves integration up to time T, the part of the path after the intervention will incorporate effects due to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\). Thus, \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) reflects the properties of both the initial and intervened values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
