  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its related complex function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). We examine the impact of these transformations on the integration path in the complex plane.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( g(z) \\\\) on a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and integrate along a contour C from point A to B in the complex plane, will the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C g(f(z)) dz \\\\) be the same as integrating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from A to B directly without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\) modifies the values of the function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) on the integration path, changing the nature of the function being integrated. This leads to a different resulting integral, as the sinusoidal modification significantly alters the integrand.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
