  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), evolving under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} z(0) \\\\), where A is a constant real number representing the angular frequency. This transformation is an example of a complex rotation in the time domain.\n\nCan we definitively discern whether an intervention occurred and what the values of A and B were by only analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it's challenging to uniquely backtrack to confirm whether an intervention occurred and to determine the exact values of A and B without additional information. The outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various scenarios involving different values of A and B, as well as different intervention timings due to the non-uniqueness of the solutions in the complex plane rotations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
