  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, simplified to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\nu\\\\nabla^2u\\\\), where u is the velocity field, p is pressure, and ν is viscosity. Evaluate the behavior under a Fourier transform of the velocity field, represented as \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\), where k is the wave number.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( F(u)(k, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the Navier-Stokes dynamics precisely to retrieve \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from \\\\( F(u)(k, t) \\\\) is highly complex due to the turbulent and viscous nature of fluid flow, which can be sensitive to small variations in initial conditions. The lack of information on the initial Fourier transform further complicates the exact recovery of \\\\( u_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
