  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t according to the integral transform \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with K(s) being a complex kernel function. The initial condition at t = 0 is \\\\(z_0\\\\). An intervention function \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves from \\\\(z_0\\\\) over a period T according to the given integral transformation without any intervention, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) be independent of the choice of the kernel function K(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is directly dependent on the form of the kernel function K(s). Different choices of K(s) will generally result in different trajectories and endpoints for \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
