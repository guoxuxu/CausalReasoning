  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We analyze the effect of the integral transform \\( g(z) = \\int e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf at some point \\( z(t) \\) is modified such that \\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\delta)t} \\) for \\( \\delta \\neq 0 \\) and the transform \\( g(z) \\) is recalculated, will the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) reflect the presence of \\( \\delta \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\( \\delta \\) alters the growth or decay rates along with oscillation, affecting how the transform \\( g(z) \\) processes the function. This results in \\( g(z) \\) capturing not just \\( \\omega \\) but also the effects of \\( \\delta \\), showcasing a change in the original dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
