  "Problem": "Consider a function on a complex plane governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^{2} \\\\) affects the output when applied at different instances.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final result \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect a simple composition of the effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the trajectory by shifting every subsequent value of \\\\( z \\\\) before further transformations. Since the exponential function is sensitive to addition (shifting the exponential growth rate), the final value will depend intricately on the interaction between these transformations, and not just their mere composition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
