  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) before the transformation, where \\\\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) under interventions (first \\\\( L \\\\), then \\\\( M \\\\)), can we specify which interventions were applied just by observing the output \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations induced by \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) (i.e., first and second derivatives of \\\\( G(s) \\\\)) can potentially overlap with or mimic each other in ways that make it impossible to segregate or identify the specific nature of interventions purely from the output \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The similar effects on derivatives blur specific intervention characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
