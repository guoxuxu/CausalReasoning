  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the complex function is \\\\( z(t) = w(t) + iu(t) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) representing the real part and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) the imaginary part governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{w} = Cw\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\), here C and D are constant matrices. Analyze the system after applying the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(w(t)) + i\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) and then conducting an inverse transform.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the initial transformations included a Laplace transform or the mid-way application of the Fourier transform, only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the history of transformations applied (Laplace, Fourier, or both) from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated by the potential overlapping effects and mathematical properties of the transformations, which might not necessarily leave distinguishable features at the endpoint observable in \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
