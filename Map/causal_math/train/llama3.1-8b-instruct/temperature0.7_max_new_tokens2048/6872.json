  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Investigate how the Fourier transform affects this system, particularly through a transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is the variable of transformation.\n\nKnowing the outcome of a sequence of Fourier transformations at different frequencies, can we precisely determine the original function and the sequence of applied transformations?",
  "Explanation": "While the final form of the transform provides some clues, multiple combinations of original functions and transformation sequences can yield the same final result due to the nature of the Fourier transform. The process lacks uniqueness without additional restrictions or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
