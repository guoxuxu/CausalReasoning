  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time Markov chain with state space \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\) governed by the transition rate matrix \\\\(Q = \\\\begin{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda & \\\\lambda \\\\\\\\ \\\\mu & -\\\\mu \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\). We are investigating the effect of modifying transition rates with a scalar function \\\\(f(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial scalar \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) used to modify the transition rates after observing the state probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing whether the rates were scaled?",
  "Explanation": "The observed probabilities at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) could result from various combinations of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\). Without clear records of initial conditions or interventions applied, the specific value of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) cannot be inferred solely from the final state probabilities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
