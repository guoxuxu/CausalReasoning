  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\partial_t u = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) applied to the function \\(u(x, 0)\\) at \\(t = 0\\).\n\nIf during the evolution at a certain time \\(t_1\\), a Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is further applied as an intervention, will the state \\(u(x, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depend solely on \\(L\\) and not on the effects from the Fourier or Laplace transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Laplace transform adds complexity by modifying the domain once again and impacting how the differential operator \\(L\\) acts on the system. Hence, the final state depends on the interaction between \\(L\\), \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), altering the trajectory in potentially complex ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
