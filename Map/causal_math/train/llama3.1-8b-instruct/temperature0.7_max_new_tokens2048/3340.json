  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 v = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). Assess the effect of the boundary condition alteration defined through \\\\( v' = v + h \\\\) on the boundary \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a known function defined on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(v''(x)\\\\) in the domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), can one conclusively identify whether boundaries were modified once as \\\\(v'\\\\) or twice as \\\\(v''\\\\) based solely on observation of the final function?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the sequence or number of interventions on boundary conditions exclusively from the final state \\\\(v''(x)\\\\) is not feasible. Multiple pathways of interventions may lead to similar or such undistinguishable solutions that disambiguating them from the end state alone is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
