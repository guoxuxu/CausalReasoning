  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) undergoing the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane. The system's behavior is analyzed against the backdrop of an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), with s as a complex parameter.\n\nIf an intervention applying a different transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real constant) is introduced at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the original transformation parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new rotational factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\beta t} \\\\) composes with the original transformation, affecting the overall trajectory and thus the final integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Both parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) influence the resultant transform, making it dependent on both.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
