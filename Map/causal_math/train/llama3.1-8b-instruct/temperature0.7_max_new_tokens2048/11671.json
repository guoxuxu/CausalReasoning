  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is first transformed via a Fourier transform, generating \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), and is then processed by a system with a frequency response function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The output is \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and it undergoes an inverse Fourier transform to produce the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a specific frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), by altering the system's response at that frequency, will this affect the overall form of the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the system's response at specific frequencies directly affects the processed signal \\\\( Y(\\\\omega) \\\\), consequently altering the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after the inverse Fourier transformation, showing how sensitive the output is to frequency-specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
