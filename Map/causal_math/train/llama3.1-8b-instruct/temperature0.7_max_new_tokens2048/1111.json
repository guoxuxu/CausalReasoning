  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system undergoing forced vibration governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = F(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) is the damping ratio, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the natural frequency, and \\\\(F(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t)\\\\) represents external periodic forcing. We explore the consequences of applying a transformation through convolution with an impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\zeta\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf a new impulse response function \\\\(g(t) = e^{-2\\\\zeta\\\\omega t}\\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the final response \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original system parameters and not the applied functions \\\\(h(t)\\\\) or \\\\(g(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional convolution with \\\\(g(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a further modification to the input affecting the system's inherent characteristics. This change in input properties due to both convolutions affects the overall system response, making the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) dependent on the properties of both \\\\(h(t)\\\\) and \\\\(g(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
