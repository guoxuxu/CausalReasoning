  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region undergoing a heat transfer process modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T + S(x,y,z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term depending on position and time. An intervention is introduced by applying a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) was applied, the alteration introduced by \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\) could obscure the true initial state. Since this term decays over time, its influence at later times might not be significant, making it challenging to infer the exact initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
