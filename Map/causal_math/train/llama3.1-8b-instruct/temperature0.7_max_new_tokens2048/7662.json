  "Problem": "Consider that velocity \\\\( v \\\\) of a particle moving in a one-dimensional space is governed by the equation \\\\( v = \\\\omega x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of an integral transform \\\\( I(x) = \\\\int x e^{-\\\\lambda t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is also a constant, applied to the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of the particle.\n\nGiven the velocity \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( I(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( I(x) \\\\), the original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) remains indeterminable because the integral transformation could have modified the initial position in an irreversible manner, especially as the transformation involves integration over time with an exponential decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
