  "Problem": "The system under study is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. The impact of an integral transformation represented by the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a kernel function, is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention by another convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast J \\\\), where \\\\(J\\\\) is a different kernel, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the transformation only depend on \\\\( L \\\\) excluding influences from \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( u \\\\) has already been affected by \\\\( K \\\\) due to the initial convolution, and applying \\\\( u \\\\ast J \\\\) introduces yet another convolutional influence. The resulting system's behavior by time \\\\(T\\\\) is a combined effect of \\\\( L, K, \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\), with each contributing to the final state in a potentially interdependent manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
