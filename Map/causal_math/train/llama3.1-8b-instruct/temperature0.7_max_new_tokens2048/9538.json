  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature (T) at any spatial point (x,y) in a region follows the heat equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\nabla^2 T\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We study the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the temperature distribution, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)\\\\), and analyze its influence over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed temperature distribution \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial temperature distribution at t = 0 without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier Transform was applied, reconstructing the original spatial temperature distribution T from \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(T)(t)\\\\) is uncertain. The transformation might encode the frequencies differently, obscuring the real starting conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
