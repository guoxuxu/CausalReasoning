  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(z(t))dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nCan we precisely identify an earlier intervention, such as a multiplier or additional function, by analyzing the result of \\\\( T[f](z(T)) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) integrates the effects of the intervention over an infinite timeline, which dilutes and blends the specific impact of any particular intervention. The cumulative nature of the integral, combined with potential complexities in the original function's evolution, obscures the direct causal link between specific interventions and their resultant transform at any given point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
