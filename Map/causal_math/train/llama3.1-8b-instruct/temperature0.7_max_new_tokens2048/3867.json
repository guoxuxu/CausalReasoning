  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator L acting on a function space, defined as L[f(x)] = f''(x) - 4f(x). We are interested in how the use of an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform denoted by \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), affects the solutions of the differential equation L[f(x)] = 0.\n\nIf an additional transformation, the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\), is applied to f(x) before taking the Laplace Transform, does the final representation in the Laplace domain only depend on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier Transform followed by the Laplace Transform introduces complexities not present in the original problem. The final form in the Laplace domain will depend both on the original operator L and how the Fourier Transform affects the function, altering its behavior and potentially the domain's boundary conditions or properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
