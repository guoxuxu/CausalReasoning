  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\). The relationship between input and output is governed by the differential equation \\\\( V'(t) = \\\\frac{1}{C}I(t) - \\\\frac{1}{RC}V(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. We examine scenarios where a Laplace transform operation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) to analyze the system.\n\nIf an intervention in terms of altering the Laplace transform of \\\\( I(t) \\\\), say by modifying it to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(I)(s) + p(s) \\\\) where \\\\( p(s) \\\\) is a polynomial in s, is applied, will the end behavior of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) strictly reflect changes in the structure of the resistor-capacitor network?",
  "Explanation": "While changing the Laplace transform of the input influence \\\\( I(t) \\\\) affects the system, it is not merely through the static properties of R or C. The modification introduces a new element to the input shaping both the transient and steady-state response. Thus, these adjustments in the transform domain affect the response in a manner dependent on the details of \\\\( p(s) \\\\) along with R and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
