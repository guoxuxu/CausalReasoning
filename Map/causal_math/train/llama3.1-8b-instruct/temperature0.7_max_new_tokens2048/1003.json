  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a matrix-valued function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\) where \\\\( M \\\\) is a matrix on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function represents a transformation in the complex plane and is examined over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = Nz \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = Nz \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the trajectory from that point, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on the initial modification by \\\\( M \\\\), as well as the latter intervention by \\\\( N \\\\), in addition to the underlying dynamics described by \\\\( A \\\\). The system's evolution is therefore influenced by all these factors combined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
