  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = te^{it} \\\\) on a real signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(s) z(t-s) ds \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(t) = e^{-2it} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting signal at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) exhibit altered periodicities solely because of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( w(t) = e^{-2it} \\\\) does not isolate modifications to periodicities solely due to it; both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) contribute to changes in periodic structures. The combination leads to more complex frequency relationships in the resulting signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
