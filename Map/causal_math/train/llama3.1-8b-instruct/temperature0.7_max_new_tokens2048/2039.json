  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) represents the Laplacian operator. We are interested in the effect of applyingt the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\), which transforms the function into the Fourier space, on the causal inference in the system.\n\nAssuming at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the inverse Fourier transform is applied as an intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) not be affected by the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the inverse Fourier transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) effectively brings the function back to its spatial representation, which then continues to evolve according to the spatial PDE. The intervention does not alter the evolution but dictates in which space (Fourier or spatial) the evolution continues.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
