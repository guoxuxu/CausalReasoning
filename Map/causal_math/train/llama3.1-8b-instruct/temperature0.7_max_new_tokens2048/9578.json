  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), on this function and analyzing its impact on the system's dynamics.\n\nCan the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be uniquely identified by observing its Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\), and the pole at \\\\( s = i \\\\omega \\\\) directly indicates the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This information is explicitly preserved and can be uniquely identified from the transform, allowing for accurate inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the effect back to the cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
