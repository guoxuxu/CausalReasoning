  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We look into the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x) dx \\\\) to the function u(x, t) and analyzing its effect over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is added as an intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), for T > t_1 depend only on L or on the nature of v(x) as well?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( v(x) \\\\) modifies u(x, t) at time \\\\(t_1 \\\\), introducing new components or altering existing dynamics, making the endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) \\\\) dependent on both the nature of L and the characteristics of the intervention \\\\( v(x) \\\\). The transformation integrates the effects of L and any modifications due to v(x).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
