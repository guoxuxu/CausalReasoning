  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) defined in the complex plane by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function representing the system's response and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines the effects and causal inferences when the function is modified by a transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the modified output of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) after an intervention, can we precisely determine if the transformation \\\\( t^k \\\\), the operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\), or both were applied during the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final modified output of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations and interventions, including differing powers of \\\\( t \\\\) in \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and different order of derivatives in \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\). Without explicit tracking of interventions and transformations applied, it's not possible to precisely infer the exact sequence or type of modifications used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
