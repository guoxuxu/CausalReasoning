  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nBy observing the peak of the Fourier transformed function after applying the damping factor, can we determine whether the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the damping coefficient \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) had a greater effect?",
  "Explanation": "The peak of the Fourier transform with a damping factor does not uniquely clarify the relative influence of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) versus \\\\( \\alpha \\\\). Both parameters crucially shape the transformed function's peak, and their effects are intertwined in the resulting spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
