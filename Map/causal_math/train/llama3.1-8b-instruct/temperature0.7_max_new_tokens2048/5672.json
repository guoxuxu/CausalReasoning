  "Problem": "Consider a system subject to the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents a time-dependent state of the system. The impact of convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) expressed as \\\\( h(t) = (f*g)(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( J(s) = L[j(t)] \\\\) after interventions, can we conclusively determine if \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was used prior to \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or if a different sequence of function applications resulted in \\\\( J(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of \\\\( J(s) = F(s)G(s)K(s) \\\\) does not specify the order of convolutions nor does it exclude the possibility of different functions replicating the same final state. Multiple sequences of different convolutions can yield the same \\\\( J(s) \\\\), making it impossible to identify the sequence of interventions uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
