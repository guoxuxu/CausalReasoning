  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the Laplace transform of a function f(t), given by F(s) = \\\\(\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\). The behavior of the system is also influenced by a Fourier transform transformation, defined by G(ω) = \\\\(\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-iωt}f(t) dt\\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original Laplace transformed function F(s) after observing its evolution outcome under a subsequent Fourier transformation G(ω)?",
  "Explanation": "The information encoded in G(ω) primarily focuses on frequency content without directly preserving the exponential decay factors contained in F(s). Fourier transforms do not retain specific details about the exponential attenuation emphasized by the Laplace transform, making exact back-tracing to F(s) unclear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
