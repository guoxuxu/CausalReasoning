  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of functions where the kernel operator K is defined on a function y(x). The relationship between y and its image under K is described through a convolution, i.e., \\\\( K*y = \\\\int h(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\), where h(t) is an impulse response function. We are interested in how the application of Fourier Transform (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) might influence this relationship.\n\nCan we determine whether an intervention (changing h(t) to g(t)) occurred, by only observing the Fourier Transform of the convolution result at a later stage?",
  "Explanation": "The final Fourier Transform of the convolution output could be influenced by many factors, including changes in the function y or the impulse response function. Without knowing the initial or intermediate states exactly, it is infeasible to pinpoint the specific intervention solely from the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
