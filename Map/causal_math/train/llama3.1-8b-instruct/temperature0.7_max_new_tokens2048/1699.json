  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature T in a region evolves according to the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Suppose a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(T) = T + \\\\beta \\\\cos(\\\\phi t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(T) \\\\) introduces another temperature modifying factor, making the final temperature \\\\( T(T) \\\\) dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) but also significantly affected by both the initial transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( g(T) \\\\). The interaction between the sinusoidal and cosinusoidal inputs can create complex temperature patterns.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
