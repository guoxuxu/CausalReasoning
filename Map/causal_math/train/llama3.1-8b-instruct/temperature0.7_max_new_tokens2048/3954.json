  "Problem": "Analyze a complex electrical circuit involving resistors (R), capacitors (C), and inductors (L), modeled by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int I dt\\\\), where V is voltage, I is current, t is time, and R, L, C are constants. Consider the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\\\), applied to V(t).\n\nCan the initial state of the current I(0) be determined solely by analyzing the Laplace transform of the voltage \\\\(V(s)\\\\) at time T, without additional information about circuit parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of V(t) encodes information about the integral behavior over time, but it does not specifically reveal discrete initial conditions like I(0) without explicit knowledge of R, L, and C values. This information is essential to uniquely invert the Laplace transform to capture the exact initial current.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
