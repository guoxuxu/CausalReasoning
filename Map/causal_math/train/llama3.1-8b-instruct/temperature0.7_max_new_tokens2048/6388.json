  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(D\\\\). We explore the effect of a boundary condition transformation, where the transformation is represented by \\\\(g(s) = e^{\\\\lambda s}\\\\) applied along the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial D\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\) at some time after intervention, can we precisely identify which intervention (\\\\(g(s)\\\\) or \\\\(h(s)\\\\)) was applied at each part of the boundary?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the Laplace equation in a domain does not uniquely specify the boundary conditions due to the potential for similar internal solutions deriving from differing boundary interventions. Without additional information, the precise nature and distribution of interventions \\\\(g(s)\\\\) and \\\\(h(s)\\\\) cannot be conclusively ascertained just by knowing \\\\(u(x, y)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, y) → Δu = 0; g(s) → e^(λs); g(s) → u(x, y); Δu = 0 → Laplace equation; e^(λs) → g(s); h(s) → u(x, y)"
