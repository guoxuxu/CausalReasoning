  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). We explore the implications of modifying the transform by a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, on the inverse transformation and how it impacts the original time-domain function.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( G(s) = H(s) + e^{-bs} \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant) is applied at some point s = s_1, does the resulting function derived from the inverse Laplace Transform depend only on the original function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) without being affected by the modifications from \\\\( e^{-as} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-bs} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(s) \\\\) modifies the final form of the function by adding another shifted version of the unit impulse (or another function depending on the context of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)). The new resulting time-domain function derived from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) will exhibit dependencies on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), evidencing an influence from all changes made to the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
