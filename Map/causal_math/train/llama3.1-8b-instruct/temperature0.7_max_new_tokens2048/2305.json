  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = cos(x) + i sin(x) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Let us examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( z(x) t= e^tx \\\\) on this complex function over a time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( e^tx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the function is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(x, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) represent a rotation in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^tx \\\\) results in \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{e^T x} \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), which simplifies to \\\\( cos(e^T x) + i sin(e^T x) \\\\. This represents a rotation by \\\\( e^T x \\\\) radians in the complex plane, hence maintaining the rotational property of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
