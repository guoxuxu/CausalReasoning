  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + a u_x = 0 \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x, t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-ks} u(x, s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) and knowing the constant \\\\( a \\\\) from the PDE, can we determine precisely what operations were used (whether \\\\( T[u] \\\\), \\\\( S[u] \\\\), or both), merely by analyzing \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) in PDE, the interpretation of \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\) isn't sufficient to uniquely identify the sequence or form of transformations applied due to the overlapping influence and integral accumulation, meaning different combinations of initial conditions and operations may yield similar outcomes at \\\\( T[u](x, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
