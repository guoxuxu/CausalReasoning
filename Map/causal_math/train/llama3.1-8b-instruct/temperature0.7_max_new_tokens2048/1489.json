  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) at \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) is applied, it changes the initial condition to \\\\( z(t_0)^k \\\\). This alteration results in a different trajectory where instead the function evolves as \\\\( e^{ikwt} \\\\) from \\\\( t_0 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), fundamentally changing the point at \\\\( t = T \\\\) due to differing frequencies in the exponent compared to direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
