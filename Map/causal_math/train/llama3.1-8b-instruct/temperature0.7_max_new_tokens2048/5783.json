  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics in a control system where the output \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = Kx(t) + Du(t) \\\\), with \\\\(x(t)\\\\) as the state vector evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) as the control input. The matrices A, B, K, D are constant. Consider the effect of a transformation \\\\( v(t) = Ce^{Lt}u(t) \\\\) applied to the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\), where C and L are also constant matrices.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the intervention \\\\( w(t) = Me^{Nt}u(t) \\\\) is applied, where M and N are constants, will the system's output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 strictly depend on the properties of A, B, K, and D, without influence from the transformations C and M?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the system's inherent dynamics are governed by A, B, K, and D, the application of interventions such as \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and the initial transformation \\\\( v(t) \\\\) add additional layers of influences. These transformations modify the input in compound ways, thus affecting the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through the integrated effects of C, L, M, and N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
