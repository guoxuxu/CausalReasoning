  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) influenced by an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'}z(t')dt' \\\\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied at time t = 0 to the function \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to its state if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) had not been applied and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved normally?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial trajectory by integrating over a history of modified states influenced by the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). Even though the function evolves under the same differential equation afterward, its initial altered state by \\\\( f \\\\) causes it to follow a different trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
