  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether a Fourier or Laplace transform, or both, were applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or \\\\( K(t) \\\\), especially considering an intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Due to potential overlaps and interactions between the effects of Fourier and Laplace transforms on the convolution output, and the non-trivial inverse problem of deconvolution, it is challenging to specify exactly which transformations were applied or their order based solely on the output data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
