  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, defining a rotation in the complex plane with time. Let's study the system under a transformation specified by the operator \\\\( L \\\\) taken as a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( F[\\\\cdot] \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F[z] \\\\) is computed initially, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve with time under its inherent dynamics without any external alteration, does the spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The inherent dynamics described by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a simple rotation in the complex plane, which does not modify the frequency components of the signal. Therefore, the spectrum remains unchanged at any time \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
