  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\), obeying the differential equations \\( \\dot{u} = Au \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = Bv \\), respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T}(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\) on this complex function over time.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\( z(0) \\) without knowing whether the integral transformation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\), it is impossible to uniquely backtrack from \\( \\mathcal{T}(z)(T) \\) to \\( z(0) \\), as the transformation involves an integral that obscures direct causal relationships and introduces ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
