  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra scenario where the action of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\) on a vector space is modified by a function \\\\( g(v) = V^{-1}e^{Dt}Vv \\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonal matrix, \\\\(V\\\\) is the matrix representing a basis transformation, and \\\\(v\\\\) is an arbitrary vector in the space.\n\nCan we conclusively determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(v) \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), or combinations thereof) after solely observing the resultant vector at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant vector at \\\\( t = T \\\\) could arise from various sequences and combinations of applications involving \\\\( g(v) \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), and \\\\( L \\\\). Because the transformations may affect each other in nontrivial ways, especially in non-commutative scenarios, it is challenging to uniquely trace back and identify exactly which transformations and in what order were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
