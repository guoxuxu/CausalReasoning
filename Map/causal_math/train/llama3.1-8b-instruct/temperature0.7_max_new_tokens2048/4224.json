  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we precisely determine what transformations were applied (either \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both) based solely on the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that complex exponential transformations may differ only by a phase, different combinations of transformations and initial conditions can lead to the same endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). The non-uniqueness of the solutions in the presence of interventions like \\\\(k(z)\\\\) and initial transformations \\\\(h(z)\\\\) means that multiple valid transformation sequences could result in the same observed state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
