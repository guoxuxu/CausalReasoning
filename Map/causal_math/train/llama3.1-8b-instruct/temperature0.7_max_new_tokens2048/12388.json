  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform which converts this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed by the Laplace transform to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and then mapped back to the time domain via the inverse Laplace transform, will the resulting function precisely match the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse form a unique pair when the function and the conditions for its transformation meet standard requirements, including necessary convergence conditions. Here, assuming all conditions are met, \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) should perfectly reconstruct from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) through the inverse process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
