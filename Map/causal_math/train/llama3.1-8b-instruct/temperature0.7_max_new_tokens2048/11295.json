  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nIf after some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the system's state at any future time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be influenced only by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The successive applying of transformations introduces additional scaling factors at different times, which influence the magnitude and phase rotation of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). This results in a system behavior at time \\\\(T\\\\) that is dependent not only on the original differential equation parameter \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) but also significantly on transformations \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), each contributing to the overall state evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
