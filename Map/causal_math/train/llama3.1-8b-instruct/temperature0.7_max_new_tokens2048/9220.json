  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network where the voltage across a circuit element is governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) = H(s)I(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) represents the complex impedance of the element and \\\\( I(s) \\\\) is the transformed input current. The effect of an intervention by adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to the system is studied.\n\nGiven the changed voltage \\\\( V'(s) \\\\) after the intervention of adding a parallel impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can one determine exactly whether \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) was added, solely from the knowledge of \\\\( V'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( V'(s) \\\\) alone does not definitively indicate whether the change in voltage was due to a change in \\\\( I(s) \\\\) or the introduction or type of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). The impact on the voltage can be due to various combinations of changes in these factors making it indeterminate without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
