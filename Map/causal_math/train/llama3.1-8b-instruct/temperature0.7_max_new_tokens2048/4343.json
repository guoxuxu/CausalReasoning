  "Problem": "Consider a function represented in the complex plane as \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\), which is transformed by the integral \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{z} dz\\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane that encircles the origin once and t is a parameter.\n\nIf a correction factor \\\\(h(z) = z\\\\) is applied to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) before applying the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\), will \\\\(g(z)\\\\) reduce to the simple evaluation of an integral irrespective of the value of t?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) before transformation turns the function into \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\cdot z = 1\\\\). When this corrected function is transformed, the integral \\\\(\\\\int_{C} e^{zt} dz\\\\) simplifies to 0 for all t≠0 due to the nature of the integral of an exponential function along a closed path, thus ignoring variations due to t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
