  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform intervention \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx\\\\).\n\nIf the system starts with an initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\), and the Fourier transform is not applied at any point, will the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be solely determined by the heat equation's dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) is governed only by the heat equation without any external transformations or interventions. Thus, \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) develops according to the diffusion properties dictated by \\\\(k\\\\) and the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
