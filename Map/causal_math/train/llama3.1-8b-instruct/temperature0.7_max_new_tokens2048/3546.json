  "Problem": "Let us consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time. We analyze how this function transforms under the application of a differential operator \\\\( D = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) and also how it behaves when modified by a scheduled intervention described as multiplication by a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\).\n\nKnowing the result of the transformation \\\\( Dz(t) \\\\) at time T, can we retrieve the exact original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( Dz(t) = iz(t) \\\\) and knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), one can recover \\\\( z(0) \\\\), since \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and \\\\( z(0) = e^{i0} \\\\) is a determinable base value. The differential equation \\\\( Dz(t) = iz(t) \\\\) uniquely defines the original without loss of information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
