  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at n = 1 a new function \\\\(h(y) = Cy\\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied after \\\\(g(y)\\\\) was already applied at n = 0, will the final state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) for N > 1 depend solely on the properties of A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Interventions of \\\\(g\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) at initial states introduce modifications that are propagated through the subsequent actions of A. The final state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) will bear the marks of all applied matrices: B at n = 0 and C at n = 1, along with the recurring transformations via A, making it dependent on all three matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
