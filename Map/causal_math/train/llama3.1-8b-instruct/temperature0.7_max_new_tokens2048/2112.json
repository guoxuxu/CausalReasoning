  "Problem": "Imagine a complex dynamic pattern governed by the linear differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. The behavior is significantly altered by an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt} x(t') dt' \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and t spans from 0 to a finite time T.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which interventions (whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( U(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the state at T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used to reach \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is complicated due to the potential overlapping effects of the matrix exponentials from transformations \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( U(x) \\\\). Both transformations could produce similar effects, making it unclear which were applied. This ambiguity complicates causal inference from final state to transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
