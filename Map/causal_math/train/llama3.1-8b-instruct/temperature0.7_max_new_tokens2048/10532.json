  "Problem": "In the context of a heat conduction problem, assume a rod along the x-axis where the temperature distribution at time t is given by the function \\( u(x,t) \\), which satisfies the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\). We consider an integral transformation \\( f(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-sx}u(x,0) \\, dx \\) (Fourier Transform) and study its impact on the solution when applied initially.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\), can we identify precisely which transformations were used \\( f(u) \\), \\( g(u) \\), or both, merely by the nature of the temperature distribution at \\( u(x,T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences or types of Fourier Transform interventions may lead to similar or even identical temperature distributions at the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\), especially due to linearity and the convolution property in the heat equation. Thus, identifying specific interventions from the final state alone is unreliable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
