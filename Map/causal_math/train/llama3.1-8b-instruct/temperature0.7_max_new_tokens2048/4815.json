  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nIf a modification \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before taking the Fourier Transform, will the resulting transform \\\\( G(w) \\\\) simply be the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z^2 \\\\) times \\\\( F(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of squaring the function prior to the Fourier Transform profoundly alters the nature of the original function. It's not merely a multiplicative scaling in the frequency domain; rather, it affects the function's entire structure and hence the result of the Fourier Transform can't be represented as a simple product of transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
