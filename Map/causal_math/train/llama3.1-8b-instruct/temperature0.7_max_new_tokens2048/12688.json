  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We study the influence of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) from s = 0 to s = t, and then the function is allowed to evolve under no further transformations, will the integral \\\\( z(t) \\\\) resemble the behavior of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) directly evolving without the transformation over the same interval?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) which includes the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) modifies the initial conditions and accumulates the effect over the interval, thus altering the trajectory and behavior of the function from its natural progression.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
