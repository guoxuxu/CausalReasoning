  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the linear differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) with an initial input \\( z_0 \\). The system undergoes a transformation \\( h(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Et}z dt \\), where E is a constant matrix and T is the final time.\n\nKnowing the final output \\( z(T) \\), can we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\( h(z) \\), \\( k(z) \\), or both) were applied, based only on the outcome at \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used is complicated by the overlapping effects of the matrix exponentials and their integrations. Multiple combinations of \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) could lead to the same endpoint \\( z(T) \\), making it infeasible to uniquely backtrack the sequence or type of interventions accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
