  "Problem": "Let's consider the linear functional transformation \\\\( F(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a fixed but unknown function. We explore the consequences of applying \\\\( F(g) \\\\) to different functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) under continuous and piecewise mappings.\n\nGiven the resultant output from \\\\( F(g) \\\\) under changes from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + h(t) \\\\), can we back-calculate to identify both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the exact form of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the observed output and knowing the intervention applied, reconstructing both \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and distinguishing the contributions solely from \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\) independently is impractical without more restrictive assumptions about the functions, due to the convolution nature introducing potential overlaps in effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
