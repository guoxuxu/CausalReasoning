  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. This transformation applies to a signal analysis context where the function represents a wave. Suppose we apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\xi) \\\\) at some point.\n\nFrom the observed spectrum at time T, can we determine the presence and specific nature (exact \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)) of a phase shift intervention after the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the phase of the signal deviates from what is expected purely from \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), it is indicative of an intervention. By analyzing the phase differences in the spectrum, the specific nature of the phase shift (i.e., the value of \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)) can accurately be deduced from the extent of deviation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → z(t); z(t) → F(z)(ξ); F(z)(ξ) → observed spectrum at time T; observed spectrum at time T → presence of phase shift intervention; observed spectrum at time T → nature of phase shift intervention (θ)"
