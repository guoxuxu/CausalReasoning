  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system in a complex plane under the influence of an external force and initial conditions. The position of a particle in the complex plane is described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the position, respectively, in time t. The position is further affected by the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nHaving observed the position \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T, is it possible to infer the initial position \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied, the initial condition could be one of multiple possible states resulting from different angular displacements imparted by the transformation \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), complicating backward calculation to \\\\(z_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
