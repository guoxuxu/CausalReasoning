  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\), and A is a complex number. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( Tz = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another complex number.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( Hz = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) (where C is a complex number) is applied at t = t_1 as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( Hz \\\\) introduces another dynamical modification, compounding the effects of the original transformation \\\\( Tz \\\\) and the differential behavior described by \\\\( A \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, and C, due to the overlapping integral impacts and dynamics-induced variations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
