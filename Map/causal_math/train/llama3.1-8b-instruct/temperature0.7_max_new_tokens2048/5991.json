  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) described by a pair of coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), where A and B are constants. Explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this system over time t.\n\nIf an additional manipulation, \\\\( U[z(t)] = t^2z(t) \\\\), is applied at some time t_1 as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original differential equations without influence from \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) or \\\\( U[z(t)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U[z(t)] \\\\), which manipulates the function by scaling it quadratically with time, when compounded with the initial integral transformation, significantly affects the end state. Both transformations actively modify the evolution dynamics in a way that depends on the specific form and interaction of A, B, \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\), and \\\\( U[z(t)] \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
