  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without further actions, will the transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be different for a different frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) compared to the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) results in a different function \\\\( Z'(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\). These functions are not equivalent unless \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega' \\\\), indicating a dependency on the frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
