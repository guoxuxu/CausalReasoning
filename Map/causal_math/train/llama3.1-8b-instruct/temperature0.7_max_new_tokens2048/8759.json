  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system is defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied to the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we alter the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) via a perturbing matrix D applied at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and observe the transformed functions \\\\( \\\\tilde{u}(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\tilde{v}(t) \\\\), will the resulting behaviors at time T depend only on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The insertion of the matrix D modifies the natural progression of both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). This intervention not only alters the trajectory initiated by the matrices A and B but introduces a new dynamic governed also by D, impacting both the current and consequent states up to time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
