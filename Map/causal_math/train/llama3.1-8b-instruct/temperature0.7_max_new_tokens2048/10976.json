  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nGiven \\\\( G(f) \\\\) after the application of an unknown modulating function \\\\( m(t) = e^{ct} \\\\), can we deduce both the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the constant \\\\( c \\\\) solely from \\\\( G(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Fourier Transform \\\\( G(f) \\\\) is a convolution of effects caused by both the Gaussian function and the exponential modulation. Without knowledge of the specific modulation applied, multiple functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and constants \\\\( c \\\\) could correspond to the same \\\\( G(f) \\\\), preventing unique determination of the underlying components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
