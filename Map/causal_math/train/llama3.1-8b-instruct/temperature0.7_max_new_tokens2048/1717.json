  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = w(u) \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex function of the complex variable \\\\( u \\\\). Now investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](u) = \\\\int_C f(v)e^{-uv} dv \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( f \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nIf we apply the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) to the function \\\\( z = w(u) \\\\) without further modifications, will the resultant function \\\\( T[w](u) \\\\) reflect the original dynamics of \\\\( w(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves an integral that typically alters the functional form and potentially the dynamics of \\\\( w(u) \\\\). Properties such as poles, residues, and essential singularities of \\\\( w \\\\) could significantly influence the outcome, and thus, \\\\( T[w](u) \\\\) may not conserve the original dynamics of \\\\( w(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
