  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the equation \\\\( U(x) = \\\\frac{1}{2} k x^2 \\\\) where k is a positive constant. The particle's motion is transformed by a change of coordinates given by \\\\( x(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} x_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{\\\\beta t}x(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on k and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( y(t) = e^{\\\\beta t}x(t) \\\\) introduces another scaling factor that modifies the trajectory of the particle further. The final position at time T depends on the initial scale factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), the new scale factor \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and the constant k, due to the cumulative effect of the transformations on the potential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
