  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the specific transformations (\\\\( L \\\\) and/or \\\\( M \\\\)) that were applied by observing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome observed at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of parameters and transformations, especially due to the complexity of overlapping effects in the complex plane. Different parameter values for \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( d \\\\) could lead to similar end states, making it infeasible to pinpoint the exact transformations used without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
