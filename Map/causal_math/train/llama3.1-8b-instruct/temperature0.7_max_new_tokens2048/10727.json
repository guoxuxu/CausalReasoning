  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( t \\) represents time. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation defined by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\nIf a modulation function \\( m(t) = e^{-i\\alpha t} \\) (where \\( \\alpha \\) is another constant) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the result still be a delta function centered at the original \\( \\omega \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modulation changes the frequency component of the signal; the new function becomes \\( e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} \\). Its Fourier transform results in a delta function centered at \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) instead of \\( \\omega \\), demonstrating the shift in frequency due to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
