  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to a linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix. We analyze the effect of an applied linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) being another complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\), and the resulting state \\\\( z(T) = e^{AT}e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\) will differ unless \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) commute, thereby changing the trajectory of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
