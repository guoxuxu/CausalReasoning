  "Problem": "Imagine a continuous system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) as a transformation that acts on the state variable u.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( G(u) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\hat{u}} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the operator L and not on the Fourier transform or the intervention G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\) introduces an additional modification by manipulating the spectral components of \\\\( u \\\\). Hence, the outcome \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) depends significantly on both the original Fourier transform and the subsequent intervention as well as the operator L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
