  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} x \\\\) defining a rotation in the complex plane, where A is a real constant matrix and x is a complex vector. We investigate how time-dependent transformations \\\\( f(t, z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with B also a constant matrix, influence the system's evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to progress under the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} x \\\\) without further intervention, does the vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from the vector obtained by directly evolving \\\\( x \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) initially modifies the vector to \\\\( e^{iB0}x = x \\\\). However, since B can influence the rotation angle and rate, the trajectory in the complex plane will generally differ unless A and B are effectively similar. Hence, the pathway and final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) are altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
