  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number. Further, an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied, which maps the function into the Laplace transform space.\n\nGiven the new transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) after an intervention that changes \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we determine the specific intervention (the change in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) based solely on the observed \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) can theoretically match outputs from different changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) values due to similarities in frequency effects, making it impossible to uniquely pinpoint which specific value of \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) was used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
