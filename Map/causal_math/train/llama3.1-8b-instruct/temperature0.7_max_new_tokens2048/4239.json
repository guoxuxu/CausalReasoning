  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) which describes a point moving on the unit circle in the complex plane over time t. We explore the response of the system under an integral transformation described by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a phase shift transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the original function without considering the phase shift?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of a phase shift at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new starting condition for the continuation of the integral transformation. The phase shift will alter the trajectory in the complex plane, making the final integrated output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) dependent on both the original function and the nature of the phase shift applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
