  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing a system's state over time. The system is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) + \\Delta z(t) \\\\) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( \\Delta z(t) \\\\) is a delta function, will the altered output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still reflect the properties of the original matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) momentarily at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), but the integral transform \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) will continue to reflect the influence of matrix A, as it modifies the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) hence the nature of the integration doesn't change fundamentally.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
