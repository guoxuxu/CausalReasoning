  "Problem": "Consider the behaviour of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\), under the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\). Analyze how transformations affect causality in the complex function mapping and their implications on the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) \\\\), can we reliably infer the precise time-domain signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega} \\\\) only indicates the presence of a frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but without additional information about \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), multiple time-domain signals could correspondingly generate similar features in the Laplace domain, making exact inference of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
