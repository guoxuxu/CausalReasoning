  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a differential operator. Investigate how the introduction of a boundary condition using the function \\\\(h(u) = e^{Qt}u\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another differential operator, affects the system.\n\nCan we conclusively infer the initial state \\\\(u_0\\\\) just from observing \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(h(u)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the boundary condition \\\\(h(u)\\\\), the observed state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) provides ambiguous information. The function \\\\(e^{Qt}\\\\) could have altered the initial state in multiple ways, making it impossible to uniquely deduce \\\\(u_0\\\\) without additional information about \\\\(Q\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
