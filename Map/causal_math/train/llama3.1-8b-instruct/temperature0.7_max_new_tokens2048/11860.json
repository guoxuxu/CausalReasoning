  "Problem": "Consider a complex function given by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is analyzed under the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being a constant phase shift.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by adding a phase shift \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The evolution of this new initial condition under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a trajectory that is phase-shifted by \\\\( \\theta \\\\) compared to the unmodified trajectory, leading to \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T + i\\theta} \\\\), not \\\\( e^{i\\omega T} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
