  "Problem": "In a system analyzed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator, examine the impact of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sets of transformations (F, G, their order, and parameters) can lead to the same final Fourier transform due to the complexities introduced by intervention and non-unique recovery paths in linear systems. The ambiguous interactions and possible functional overlaps between F and G transformations prevent unique identification from the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
