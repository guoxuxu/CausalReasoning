  "Problem": "In a region within a complex plane, consider the complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time. The region has a transformation applied by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which performs a Laplace transform on these functions.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) from which it was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, under proper conditions, is invertible. Knowing \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), the inverse Laplace transform can be applied to retrieve \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\), assuming the transform converges and all necessary parameters for inversion are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
