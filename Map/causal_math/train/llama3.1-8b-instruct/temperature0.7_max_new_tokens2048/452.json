  "Problem": "Consider a multi-variable function \\\\( F(z_1, z_2) \\\\) where \\\\( z_1, z_2 \\\\) are complex variables. We explore the impact of different contour deformations in the complex plane when computing the contour integral of \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nGiven that the result of the integral has changed after an unknown intervention in the contour path, can we conclusively determine whether this is due to new poles being enclosed by the contour?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific nature of the contour changes, i.e., whether it was merely deformed or restructured to enclose new poles, it is not possible to definitively conclude the reason for the change in the integral outcome. The change in the integral result could also be due to other factors such as crossing branch cuts or other singularities, not solely due to enclosing new poles.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Contour deformation can lead to new poles, which in turn can cause a change in the integral."
