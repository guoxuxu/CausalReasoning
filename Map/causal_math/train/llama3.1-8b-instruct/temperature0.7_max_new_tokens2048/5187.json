  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the function under the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a constant matrix.\n\nWith an additional intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (R being another constant matrix) is applied, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on P, or also on Q and R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces additional dynamics to the system, with transformation \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\). The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends not only on P but also on how both Q and R have influenced the trajectory throughout T, altering both growth and direction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
