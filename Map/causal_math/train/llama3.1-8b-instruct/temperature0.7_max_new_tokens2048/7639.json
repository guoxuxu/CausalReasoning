  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant angular frequency and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) applied to this function.\n\nIf a modification \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is applied at some time \\( t_1 \\), then is the system's state at \\( t = T \\) (for \\( T > t_1 \\)) only dependent on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the properties of the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the frequency-domain representation of \\( z(t) \\), potentially affecting the evolution post-\\( t_1 \\). Thus, the final state \\( z(T) \\) may depend both on \\( \\omega \\) and the specific properties or effects introduced by the transformation process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
