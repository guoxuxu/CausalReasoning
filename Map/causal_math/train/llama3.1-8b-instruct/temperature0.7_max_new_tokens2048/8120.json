  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing the motion of a particle in a plane, influenced by the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify whether the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the subsequent intervention, or both were applied, just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear interaction between multiple transformations and the intrinsic dynamics of the system, different combinations of transformations and intervention timings can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This ambiguity means that specific interventions can't be precisely identified based solely on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
