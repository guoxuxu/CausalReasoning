  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system which is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) where D is a linear operator. An external control is modeled by multipling the state vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) by a matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\), where M is a time-independent matrix and t is the time variable.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\), can one precisely determine the interventions (whether \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\), \\\\(e^{Nt}\\\\), or both) applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based on the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is not feasible because various combinations of M and N can yield the same final state due to their potential non-commutative nature and depending on their relationship with D. This creates intrinsic ambiguity in back-calculating the interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
