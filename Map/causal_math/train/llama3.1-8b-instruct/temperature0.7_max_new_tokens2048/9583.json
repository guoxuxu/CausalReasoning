  "Problem": "Consider a function $z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega$ is a real frequency parameter. We analyze the effect of a differential operator $D = \\frac{d}{dt}$ on the function over time $t$, and consider the impact of linear transformations such as $L(z) = az + b$ where $a$ and $b$ are complex numbers.\n\nIf at a certain time $t_1$, a new linear function $M(z) = cz + d$ (where $c$ and $d$ are complex numbers) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint $z(T)$ for $T>t_1$ depend only on the differential operator $D$ and not on $L$ or $M$?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with $M(z) = cz + d$ introduces additional factors affecting the state, making the endpoint $z(T)$ dependent on $L$, $M$, as well as $D$. The nature of these transformations, especially with complex numbers, will impact the resulting function at $T$, going beyond mere differentiation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
