  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain function and \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. We explore the effects of applying a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\) in the time domain, where \\\\( D[f(t)] = f'(t) \\\\), and the corresponding effect in the Laplace domain.\n\nFrom the Laplace domain representation, can it be deduced directly if the original time-domain function was differentiated before transforming?",
  "Explanation": "In the Laplace domain, the representation \\\\( sF(s) - f(0) \\\\) could also result from direct manipulation or other transformations that yield the same form. Without additional data about initial conditions or specific transformations applied, the original operation (differentiation) cannot be uniquely inferred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
