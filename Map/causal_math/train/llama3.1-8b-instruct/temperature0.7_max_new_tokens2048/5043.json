  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system state over time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. Here, A and B are constant matrices. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another variable affecting the evolution, changing the system state further. Therefore, the final state at T depends on all matrices A, B, C, and D, influenced by how they alter the trajectory through their respective exponential transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
