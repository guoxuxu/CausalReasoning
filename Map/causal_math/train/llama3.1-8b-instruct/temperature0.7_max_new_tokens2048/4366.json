  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in integral calculus defined as \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) where g is a continuously differentiable function. We analyze the impact of changing variables from x to u in the definite integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( du = g'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(g^{-1}(u)) \\\\frac{1}{g'(g^{-1}(u))} \\\\, du \\\\), without additional transformations, can we determine the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and limits a, and b?",
  "Explanation": "While we might know the transformed function and transformed limits, without the specific form of the function g or its inverse, we cannot uniquely determine the function f(x) or the original limits a and b. The resulting integral provides limited back-inference capability about the original function and limits.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
