  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\) and its application within a Laplace Transform context \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\, dt\\\\). This scenario explores how the transformation behaves under varying conditions and manipulations.\n\nAfter applying a specific regularization to transform \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and computing \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we identify the original function \\\\(f(t) = \\\\frac{1}{t}\\\\) and the specific regularization method used based solely on \\\\(F(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\(F(s)\\\\) can be influenced by both the form of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and the nature of the regularization method used. Multiple regularization approaches could yield similar \\\\(F(s)\\\\)'s for different underlying functions, hence it's difficult to trace back uniquely to both \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and the intervention method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
