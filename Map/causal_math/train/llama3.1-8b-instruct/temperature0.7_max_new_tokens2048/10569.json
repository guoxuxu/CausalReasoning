  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) under a transformation \\\\( T(r, s) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-i\\\\theta} z(r\\\\cos(\\\\theta), s\\\\sin(\\\\theta)) d\\\\theta \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\) initially describes a specific complex function and \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) is applied directly without any additional interference, does \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) ultimately change the fundamental nature or properties of \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\) applies an integral operation involving complex exponentials, effectively altering the nature of the function by transforming it into its average over a parametrically defined ellipse, thus changing the characteristics and values of the function significantly from \\\\( z(x, y) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(x, y) → r; z(x, y) → s; r → θ; s → θ; z(r, s) → T(r, s); T(r, s) → fundamental nature or properties of z(x, y)"
