  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We are interested in how the application of a Fourier transform affects this function and the consequences of its application on the behavior of the system.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) resulting from \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), can we accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible for functions like \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), which allows for the precise reconstruction of the original function from its frequency domain representation, \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
