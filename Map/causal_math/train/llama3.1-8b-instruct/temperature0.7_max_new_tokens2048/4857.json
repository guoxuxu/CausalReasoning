  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by a partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Pz = 0 \\), where \\( P \\) is a differential operator. Consider applying an integral transform \\( H \\) as defined by \\( z(t) \\mapsto \\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\) for complex \\( s \\).\n\nIf the integral transform \\( H \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve according to the equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Pz = 0 \\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\( z(s) \\) at \\( s \\) be equal to the direct application of \\( H \\) to \\( z(t) \\) evolved to infinity?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of \\( z(t) \\) under its governing equation commutes with the transformation \\( H \\), thus applying \\( H \\) at the start or after the evolution will yield the same result due to the linearity and time invariance of both the differential operator and the integral transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
