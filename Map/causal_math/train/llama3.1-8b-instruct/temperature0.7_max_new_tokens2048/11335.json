  "Problem": "Investigate a control system based on the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. Assess the impact of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function u(x,t), denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\).\n\nIf we modify the PDE by introducing a new term, \\\\(B\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x}\\\\), as an intervention and apply the Laplace transform afterwards, does the initial transformation (without the added term) affect the final state at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\(B\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x}\\\\) changes the differential equation's characteristics and thus its solution. Applying the Laplace transform after introducing this term means that the initial conditions and boundary conditions processed by the transform will encapsulate this change, thereby affecting the system's state at any future time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
