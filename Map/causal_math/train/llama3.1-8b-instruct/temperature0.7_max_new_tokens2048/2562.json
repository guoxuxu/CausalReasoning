  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function is subject to transformations using Fourier transforms over time.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the system at time T, can we exactly reconstruct the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform contains all the frequency components necessary to reconstruct the entire time evolution of the function. Knowing the transform at any time T allows for the exact calculation of the system at any other time, including T = 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
