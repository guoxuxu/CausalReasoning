  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\\\) applied to a function u(t). We study how applying another transformation \\\\( S[u](t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) either before or after T affects relations.\n\nKnowing the result \\\\( y(x) = T[u](x) \\\\) for some x, can we determine whether S was used as intervention during the transformation, or if T was applied solely to the original u(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The result y(x) alone cannot provide enough information to distinguish whether S intervened or not prior to applying T. Both sequences of application could potentially lead to similar results in y, and without additional information or constraints on u, it is not possible to uniquely determine the prior applications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
