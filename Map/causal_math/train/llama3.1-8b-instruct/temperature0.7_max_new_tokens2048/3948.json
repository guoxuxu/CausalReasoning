  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which maps time t onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Assuming we apply a transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), we investigate the effects and causal inferences from applying this transformation versus the natural evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine which transformations (\\( g(z) \\), \\( f(z) \\), or both) were applied during the evolution, solely by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple paths can lead to the same endpoint \\( z(T) \\) due to the nature of the transformations. For instance, squaring or cubing at different times can lead to the same result \\( z(T) \\) seen in the complex unit circle, making it impossible to determine uniquely which operations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
