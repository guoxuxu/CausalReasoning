  "Problem": "Analyze a feedback system involving the complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to the initial input \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and is continuously re-applied to its own output in a feedback loop. Additionally, explore how the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) influences the system over time.\n\nIf the initial input is \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the feedback loop is allowed to run without any external interruption, will the system reach a stable state as \\\\( t \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\) assuming |c|<1?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the iterative application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leads to a geometric series convergence as \\\\( t \\\\) tends to infinity if |c|<1. As each iteration depends linearly on the previous output through the complex function, the mapping inside the unit circle ensures convergence to a stable point, which is the fixed point of the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
