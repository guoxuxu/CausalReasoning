  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\), which transcribes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation is applied, such as \\\\( T[f](t)=\\\\int_0^t f(s) e^{s} ds \\\\), affecting the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and the function is allowed to evolve naturally, will the function at t = T still describe a unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) alters the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating the function with an exponential weight, which distorts the normal cyclical pattern of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), thus preventing it from describing a perfect unit circle.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
