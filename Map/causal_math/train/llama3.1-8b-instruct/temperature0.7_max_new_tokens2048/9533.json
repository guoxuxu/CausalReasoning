  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real functions of time and governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with A, B, C, D as constants. Analyze the effect of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)M}z(s)ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) is transformed at t = 0 by the operator \\\\( T \\\\), and then evolves under the given system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\), \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) without further manipulations, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to that resulting from the untransformed initial conditions evolving to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transform \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by introducing an integration over past states weighted by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{(t-s)M} \\\\), which alters the system’s natural evolution from the initial conditions. The result at any time T depends on this new transformed trajectory, which diverges from the trajectory without the application of \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
