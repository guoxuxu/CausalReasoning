  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. To analyze causal inferences, we introduce an integral transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the final observed function \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\), can we determine specifically what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely from the value at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant value \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of the integral and exponential operations influenced by P, Q, and R. This overlap and the non-linear interaction between these transformations make it impossible to uniquely pinpoint the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
