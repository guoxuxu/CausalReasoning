  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nIf \\( x(s) \\) is given as \\( x(s) = e^{As}x_0 \\) (where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( x_0 \\) is the initial condition), will the output \\( z(T) \\) solely depend on the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) and not on the specifics of \\( A \\) or \\( x_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( z(T) \\) depends on the convolution of \\( K(s, t) \\) and \\( x(s) \\). Since \\( x(s) \\) itself is influenced by \\( A \\) and the initial condition \\( x_0 \\), these elements directly affect \\( z(T) \\). The kernel \\( K(s, t) \\) modulates this effect but does not override the influence of \\( A \\) and \\( x_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
