  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the input signal and \\\\(e^{i\\omega s}\\\\) is a complex exponential function used for frequency analysis. The transformation aims to filter or modify the frequency components of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nObserving a significant response in \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time T, can we infer that \\\\(x(t)\\\\) was necessarily of frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a significant response in \\\\(z(t)\\\\) could result from any components in \\\\(x(t)\\\\) that are at frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\), but it can also include contributions from other frequencies due to the integral's comprehensive nature over time. Components close to \\\\(\\omega\\\\) or harmonic frequencies might also contribute significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
