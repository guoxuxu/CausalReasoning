  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a series of transforms: firstly by Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), followed by a scaling function in the frequency domain \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\), and then by inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\). Analyze the impact of this transformation chain and its effect on the time-domain behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the end signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can the presence and nature of the additional transformation \\\\( T \\\\) be determined solely based on the output?",
  "Explanation": "As \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S(\\\\omega) \\\\) can both modify the frequency content of the signal in potentially overlapping ways, it's challenging to isolate and identify the specific effects of \\\\( T \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) alone. The final form of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) doesn't uniquely determine the use or type of \\\\( T \\\\) without further frequency-domain analysis.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence and nature of the additional transformation T can be determined solely based on the output y(t) if it is invertible and the original signal x(t) is known, because T's effect on x(t) can be reversed to find T's nature."
