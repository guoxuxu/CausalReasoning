  "Problem": "Consider a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t)\\\\) where A is a matrix governing the system dynamics. The impact of a transformation \\\\(T(x) = e^{Ct}x(t)\\\\), where C is also a matrix, on this system is examined. The ODE system is studied under typical operation and after application of a transformation.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t=T, can we determine the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), or the specifics of C, it's impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to potential modifications on the initial state by the exponential matrix. Additional information about the application of C and its specifics is crucial for an accurate reverse calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
