  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} ds \\\\), which is an integral transformation. We assess the behavior and relationships of this function under different transformations \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z \\\\) is set to a pure imaginary number without any further functional changes, will \\\\( h(z) \\\\) be bounded?",
  "Explanation": "With \\\\( z \\\\) as a pure imaginary number, the exponential function \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) oscillates without converging, causing the integral not to be bounded. This renders \\\\( h(z) \\\\) unbounded for pure imaginary numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "s → z; z → h(z); s → h(z); h(z) bounded → s real; z imaginary → s real; s real → h(z) bounded"
