  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous system handling electric current \\( I(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dI}{dt} = -kI \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. Consider an intervention represented by the function \\( f(I) = AI^2 \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant. This study determines the impact of transformation \\( f \\) over time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( I(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( f(I) \\), \\( g(I) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( I(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact interventions used solely from \\( I(T) \\) is not feasible, as various combinations of parameters \\( A \\), \\( C \\), and \\( D \\) might result in the same \\( I(T) \\). The non-linearity introduced by \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) allows for multiple plausible scenarios that fit the observed final state, obscuring the precise history of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
