  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nBased on the spectrum \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) being a delta function at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), can we confirm that the original function was \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a single delta function in the Fourier transform \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) unambiguously points back to the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) being a pure exponential of the form \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), as other functions would introduce additional components or spread in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
