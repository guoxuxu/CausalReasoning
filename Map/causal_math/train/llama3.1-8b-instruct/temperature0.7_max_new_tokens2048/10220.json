  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the result of the integral with the integrand \\\\(z + e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\), can we conclusively determine that an intervention modified the original \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\), by knowing just the result of the intervened integral?",
  "Explanation": "The result of an integral post-intervention, especially with additional or altered complex functions, cannot conclusively determine what the original function or contour was. The complexity introduced by additions such as \\\\(e^{z^2}\\\\) masks the original function characteristics, making definitive backward inference inaccurate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
