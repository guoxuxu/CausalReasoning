  "Problem": "Consider a linear system undergoing a Fourier transform, which converts a function of time, \\\\( g(t) \\\\), into a function of frequency, \\\\( G(f) \\\\). The impact of an additional Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\{ g(t) \\\\} = G(s) \\\\) on this system is explored over time and frequency domains.\n\nBased on the final transformed state \\\\( G(s) \\\\) after both a Fourier and a subsequent Laplace transformation, can we identify if the original function was only affected by the Fourier transform or if the Laplace transform was also applied?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in transformation influences from both Fourier and Laplace transformations means that the final state \\\\( G(s) \\\\) can result from various combinations of these transformations. Therefore, it's not possible to definitively determine the specific contributions of each transform applied merely from observing the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → g(t) → G(f); Laplace transform → g(t) → G(s); G(s) → G(f); G(s) → original function affected by both transforms"
