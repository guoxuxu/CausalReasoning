  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\). We evaluate the use of an exponential transformation defined by the function \\( g(z) = e^{Ct} z \\), where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\( g(z) \\) is applied to a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) \\) modifies the initial state, and the nature of the differential equation \\( z'(t) = z(t)^2 \\) heavily depends on initial conditions. The transformation \\( e^{Ct} \\) multiplies the initial state by a factor that evolves exponentially, resulting in a fundamentally different trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
