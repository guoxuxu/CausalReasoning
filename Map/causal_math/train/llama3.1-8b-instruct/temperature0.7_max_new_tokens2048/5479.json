  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of the system is analyzed when a transformation through a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) represented by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Lz \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( M \\\\) (also represented as a matrix acting on \\\\( z \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) and not affected by \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) as an intervention adds another layer of complexity. The state at endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) not only evolves under the influence of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) but is also significantly influenced by the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), each potentially altering both magnitude and direction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
