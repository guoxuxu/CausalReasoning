  "Problem": "Consider a linear canonical transformation system governed by complex function integration \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} w(t) dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and w(t) represents an external input function. We explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( h(w) = \\\\int e^{Bt} w(t) dt \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nIf the external input \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is subjected to the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) initially, and the system is then let to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At} w(t) dt \\\\) without further intervention, does the system's output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T differ from direct integration without using \\\\( h(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( w(t) \\\\) initially via \\\\( h(w) \\\\) impacts the input dynamics by integrating it through another exponential function, \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\). This transformation can alter how w(t) contributes to z(t), changing the system's response and making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different than without using \\\\( h(w) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
