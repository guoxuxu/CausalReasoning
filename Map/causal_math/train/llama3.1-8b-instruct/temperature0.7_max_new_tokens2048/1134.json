  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant complex frequency. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform, is applied, resulting in \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nGiven a non-zero value of \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) at a specific \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), can we deduce that the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was exactly \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega' t} \\\\) without any additional phase or amplitude adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "A non-zero \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega') \\\\) indicates the presence of a frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), but it does not specify the exact phase or amplitude of that component in \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The original function could include additional phase shifts or amplitude scalings, which also result in the same frequency in the spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
