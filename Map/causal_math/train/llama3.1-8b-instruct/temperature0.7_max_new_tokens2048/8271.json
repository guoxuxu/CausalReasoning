  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic process described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\(s(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-pt} s(t) dt\\\\), where t is time and p is a complex variable. We explore the effects of modifying this function by a convolution with another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) defined in the time domain.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is introduced partway through the observation time, altering the function to \\\\((s*h)*g(t)\\\\), will the Laplace transform of this new configuration, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}((s*h)*g)(p)\\\\), be equal to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(p)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution theorem still applies when an additional function is convoluted at any point. Thus, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}((s*h)*g)(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(p)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
