  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state of a system is described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and u is a control input. Assume the control input is transformed according to \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\), where K and L are also constant matrices.\n\nIf the control input \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is implemented at t = 0 and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\) without further modifications, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T depend only on the matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\) modifies the control input, thereby changing the evolution of the state. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) not only depends on C and D but also on how K and L interact with these matrices through the control input over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
