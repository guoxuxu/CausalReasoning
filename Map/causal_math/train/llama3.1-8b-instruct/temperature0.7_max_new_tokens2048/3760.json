  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a specific end time T, can it be deduced definitively which transformations (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact transformations used to arrive at a specific state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not possible just by knowing the outcome, especially without clear timestamps or knowledge of specific transformation indices (n, m). The mathematical nature of exponentiation in complex functions often leads to results that different sequences of transformations could produce, making it ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
