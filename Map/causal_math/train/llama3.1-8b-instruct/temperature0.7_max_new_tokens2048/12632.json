  "Problem": "We consider the effects of the Laplace Transform on a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix, and study how this affects the system's response. We implement the transform \\\\(g(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\) and analyze its impact on the solution over the complex variable s.\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at any point s be equivalent to the outcome if the transform was not initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform \\\\(g(z)\\\\) modifies the function into a different domain (from time-domain to frequency-domain), affecting how the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) governs its dynamics in the complex plane. It fundamentally changes the presentation and solution of the differential equation, resulting in a different type of functional behavior in the s-domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
