  "Problem": "The behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. An operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling factor.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some later time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved under the same differential equation but without applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by scaling it, which influences the entire trajectory of the solution. The complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) affects both the magnitude and the phase of \\\\( z \\\\), resulting in a different outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
