  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We look into the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x) dx \\\\) to the function u(x, t) and analyzing its effect over time t.\n\nCan we determine precisely which intervention (like adding v(x)) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) just by observing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) \\\\), given we know L?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, T)) \\\\) represents the cumulative effect of the natural dynamics and any interventions, but different interventions could produce similar effects in the frequency domain, especially if their impacts are not distinguishable within the chosen range of analysis or because of overlapping spectral characteristics. This makes unique identification of the intervention challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
