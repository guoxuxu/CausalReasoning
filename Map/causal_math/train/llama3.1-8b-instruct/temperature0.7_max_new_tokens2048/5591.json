  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Xe^{At} \\\\) defining a complex dynamical system, where X is a complex matrix and A is a constant matrix. We are investigating how the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) affects the system behavior over the variable s.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the matrix A to a new matrix B halfway through the observed timeframe, will the final Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) reflect only the properties of B and not A?",
  "Explanation": "The final Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will reflect properties of both A and B, as the system’s behavior is influenced by both matrices over the different intervals. The change partway introduces complexities that combine the effects of both matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
