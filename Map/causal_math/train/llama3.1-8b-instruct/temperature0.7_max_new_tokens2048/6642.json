  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time t, where B is also a real constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0, can we precisely determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{iBt}z \\\\) could have altered the initial conditions such that multiple possible starting vectors \\\\( z_0 \\\\), when modified by different \\\\( B \\\\) values, could lead to the same observed state at T. Thus, without specific knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\) or whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",
