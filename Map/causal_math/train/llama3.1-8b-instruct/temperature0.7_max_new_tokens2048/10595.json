  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nIf an intervention alters the system by applying a heat source varying over time, described by the function \\( g(x, t) \\), after applying the Fourier transform to \\( T(x, 0) \\), will the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\) depend only on the heat equation without considering the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the variable heat source \\( g(x, t) \\) modifies the system dynamics, leading \\( T(x, t) \\) to depend on both the heat equation and the characteristics of \\( g(x, t) \\). The Fourier transform's initial application does not nullify effects of the dynamic intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
