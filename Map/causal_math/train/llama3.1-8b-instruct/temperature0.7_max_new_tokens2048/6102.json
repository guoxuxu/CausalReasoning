  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = u(x) + iv(x) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform to this function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\). This transform takes a complex-valued function of a real variable and transforms it into a function of the complex variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) without any additional information about the pre-transform conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the Laplace transform is linear and bijective under properly defined conditions, solely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), it is challenging to uniquely decompose and identify \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) due to potential overlap in the transformation spectra. Additional constraints or boundary conditions are required for unambiguous recovery.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
