  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is determined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. The transformations used are \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and an external force represented by \\\\( g(x,t) = h(t)x \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function.\n\nGiven the position \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the position at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same ending position, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can be achieved through various combinations of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and different forms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) in the external force \\\\( g(x,t) \\\\). The properties of differential dynamics and external influences create multiple possible trajectories that converge to the same final state, making it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
