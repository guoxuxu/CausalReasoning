  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system defined by \\\\(H(s)\\\\), the system's transfer function in the Laplace domain. Suppose there's a sinusoidal input \\\\(x(t) = A \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\), and we are investigating the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) after processing through the system.\n\nIf an intervention changes the system's transfer function to \\\\(G(s)\\\\) halfway through the response time, will the steady-state output frequency content still only reflect the input frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transfer function \\\\(G(s)\\\\) midway still preserves the overall linearity and time-invariance on a larger scale. Thus, despite the change in system characteristics (like amplitude scaling and phase shift), the frequency of the output remains unaltered and continues to be \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
