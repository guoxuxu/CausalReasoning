  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\), where V is the electric potential. A transformation under a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\) (with \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) representing spatial variables) is applied.\n\nKnowing the potential V at a point inside the domain influenced by the new boundary conditions, can one infer the original boundary before applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Once the boundary condition is transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the new state of potential V doesn't uniquely determine the original boundary conditions without further information. Multiple potential functions could converge to produce the same observed potentials, particularly without knowledge of the transformation's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
