  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( M \\\\) with another frequency matrix \\\\( e^{-i\\theta} \\\\) is applied at a point \\\\( z_1 \\\\) as an intervention, would the final form of \\\\( h(Z) \\\\) at \\\\( Z > z_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) without influence from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new frequency shift, rendering the endpoint \\\\( h(Z) \\\\) dependent not only on the initial complex growth rate \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) but also on the frequencies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\). The final expression, modulated by both transformations, incorporates effects from all these parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
