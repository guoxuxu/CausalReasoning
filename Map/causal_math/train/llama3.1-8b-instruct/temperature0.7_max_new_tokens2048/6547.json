  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator to produce an output \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(t, s) x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nIf the kernel is altered at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a new kernel \\\\( k'(t, s) \\\\), will the output at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be independent of previous kernel \\\\( k(t, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output at any time point depends on both the input signal and the kernel applied up to that time. Changes to the kernel at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) do not negate the effects of the original kernel on the signal processed before \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the resulting output will reflect the cumulative effect of both kernels applied over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t1 → k'(t, s); k'(t, s) → L[x(t)]; L[x(t)] → y(t); t → t1; t1 → y(t)"
