  "Problem": "Examine the causal effects in a system governed by a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) of a function f(t), focusing on the response of systems described by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + a} \\\\) where a is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the system's output at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine with certainty the exact nature of interventions applied (changes in value of \\\\( a \\\\) or introduction of \\\\( c \\\\)) based solely on the observed output?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potentially overlapping effects of modifying \\\\( a \\\\) and the addition of \\\\( c \\\\) on the system's transfer function, multiple intervention configurations could yield similar or even identical outputs. Therefore, determining whether adjustments to \\\\( a \\\\) or interventions introducing \\\\( c \\\\) were made based solely on the endpoint without additional information is practically infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → H(s); H(s) → output; T → observed output; observed output → a; observed output → c; c → H(s); a → output; c → output"
