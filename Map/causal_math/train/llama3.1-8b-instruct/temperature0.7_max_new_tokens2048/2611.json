  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where demand (d) and supply (s) functions for a market are governed by the parameters of a time-dependent differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{d} = Ad(t)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{s} = As(t)\\\\) respectively, with A being a negative constant that controls decay rate. The market is subjected to periodic economic swings described by a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) impacting both supply and demand, where B is a positive constant matrix showing growth over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Ct} \\\\) (introducing a counter-balancing decay factor with C as a positive constant) is utilized at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state of demand and supply at time T > t_1 depend only on the factors A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) as an intervention adds an additional dynamic to the system, making the final states of demand and supply at time T dependent on A, B, and C. The interaction between these factors through exponential growth and decay affects the resultant trajectories, denying a reliance solely on the decay factor A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
