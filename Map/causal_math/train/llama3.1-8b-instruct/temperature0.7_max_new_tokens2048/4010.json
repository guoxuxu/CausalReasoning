  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\) where \\(M\\) is also a diagonalizable matrix and \\(S\\) is the matrix that diagonalizes \\(D\\).\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without the information about the application of \\( h(x) \\) leads to an ambiguity in determining \\( x_0 \\). The transformation by \\( h(x) \\) could have altered the initial conditions non-trivially, especially since \\( e^{Mt} \\) introduces additional dynamics independent of \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
