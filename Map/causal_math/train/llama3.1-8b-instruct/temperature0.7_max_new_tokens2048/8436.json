  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) over time where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\). Explore how the application of the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), affects the causality in the system's behavior.\n\nGiven \\\\( L[z(T)] \\\\) after interventions that possibly altered any or all parameters A, B, C, D at unknown times, can we pinpoint the exact nature and timing of these changes only by observing the transform at T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform aggregates the system's entire behavior into a single function of s, effectively masking specific temporal details including the precise timing or nature of parameter changes. Due to this blending of influences across the time-span considered, the exact interventions cannot be distinctly identified from the final transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
