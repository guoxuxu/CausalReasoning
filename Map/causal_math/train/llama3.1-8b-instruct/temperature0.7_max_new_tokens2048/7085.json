  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform resulting in a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed via Laplace transform without any modifications, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) uniquely depend on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) directly depends on the form of \\\\( A \\\\). The exponential function's behavior is characterized by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\\\( A \\\\), and thus, so is the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\). This relationship is preserved and explicit in the absence of any intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
