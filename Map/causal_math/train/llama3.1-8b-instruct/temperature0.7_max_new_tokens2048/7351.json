  "Problem": "A function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined in the complex plane and its evolution is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, and analyze its effects on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) is a real constant) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on C and not be influenced by D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) adds another dynamic element to the system, so that the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the exponential factors applied by both \\\\( D \\\\) at the initial and \\\\( F \\\\) at the intermediate stage. This results in a final state shaped by \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( F \\\\), reflecting composite effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
