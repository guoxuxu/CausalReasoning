  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nAssume an intervention in the form of an additional transformation \\\\( v(w) = w^2 \\\\) is applied at some point during the evolution of the function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Does the outcome of \\\\( T(v) \\\\) depend solely on the new transformation, ignoring the initial transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function after intervention, \\\\( v(w) = (e^{iz})^2 \\\\), shows that the influence of the original transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is still present. Thus, \\\\( T(v) \\\\) depends on both the original and the intervening transformations, due to the non-linear effects of squaring the complex exponential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
