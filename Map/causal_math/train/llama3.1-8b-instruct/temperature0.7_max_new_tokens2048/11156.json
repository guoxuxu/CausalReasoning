  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex constant, and \\( z \\) represents the complex variable. This function undergoes a Laplace transform which alters its form to \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\). We analyze the effect of this transformation over different hypothetical scenarios without and with interventions.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( F(s) \\), can we unequivocally determine whether a scaling \\( B \\) on \\( z \\) was applied prior to the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The form of \\( F(s) \\) directly reveals the scaling applied. For \\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A*B} \\), identifying \\( A \\) and observing any deviation from \\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\) directly indicates the scaling by \\( B \\), providing clear evidence of the intervention on the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
