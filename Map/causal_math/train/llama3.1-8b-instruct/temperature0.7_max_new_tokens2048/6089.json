  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Dx\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, and D. The effect of a linear transformation \\\\(T\\\\) described by the matrix \\\\(\\\\begin{pmatrix} E & F \\\\\\\\ G & H \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) modifies the initial conditions which, given the non-trivial dynamics introduced by A, B, C, and D, affects the trajectory of both \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\). The matrix components E, F, G, and H alter these trajectories in a manner dependent on the interactions among all coefficients, resulting in a different complex function state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
