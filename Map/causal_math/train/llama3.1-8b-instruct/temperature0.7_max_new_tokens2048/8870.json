  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) interacting with a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. An influence is applied through a Fourier Transform defined by \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\omega^2} \\\\). We are interested in the system's behavior after consecutive transformations.\n\nGiven the resultant transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at time t = T after it has passed through complex function \\\\( F(z) \\\\), can we recover the original Laplace transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) exactly?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process influenced by \\\\( F(z) \\\\) alters the original characteristics encapsulated in \\\\( L(s) \\\\). The exact original properties of \\\\( L(s) \\\\) before modification by \\\\( F(z) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined without additional information about the nature of \\\\( F(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
