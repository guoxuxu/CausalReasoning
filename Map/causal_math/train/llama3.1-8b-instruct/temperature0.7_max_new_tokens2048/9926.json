  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Let's analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\(T[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number with positive real part.\n\nGiven the transformation result \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega}\\\\), can we uniquely determine the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the transformation \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{s-i\\\\omega}\\\\) is directly related to \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), the imaginary part of the denominator. This allows us to uniquely determine \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) despite not knowing the specific form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) beforehand.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
