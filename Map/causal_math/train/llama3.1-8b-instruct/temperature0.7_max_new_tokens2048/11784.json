  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where u and v are real-valued functions of time governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\lambda\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants. The scenario explores the consequences of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the complex function's behavior over time, with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) as a complex constant.\n\nDoes the application of transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time t = 0 modify the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > 0, assuming the system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\) with no further transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) scales and potentially rotates the initial condition, affecting the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time. The nonlinear term \\\\( k|z|^2z \\\\) is also influenced by initial condition scaling, thus changing the trajectory and thus the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
