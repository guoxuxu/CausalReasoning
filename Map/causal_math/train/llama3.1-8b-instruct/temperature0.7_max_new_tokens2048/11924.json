  "Problem": "Assume a differential equation governing the temperature \\\\( T \\\\) of a body over time is given by \\\\( \\\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env}) \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant and \\\\( T_{env} \\\\) is the environmental temperature. Now consider a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) applied at some initial time, where \\\\( h \\\\) represents a heating intervention.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the differential equation without further intervention, will the temperature \\\\( T(t) \\\\) at any later time be same as if the system started at \\\\( T(0) \\\\) without the transformation \\\\( f(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + h \\\\) changes the initial condition of the differential equation by increasing the temperature by \\\\( h \\\\) units. This alteration modifies the trajectory of the temperature decay, thereby affecting the temperature at any later time compared to an untransformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
