  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time control system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u is a control input. We investigate the role of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x(t) dt\\\\), where M is a constant matrix, in influencing the state evolution over time.\n\nCan the particular control input \\\\(u\\\\) used between t_1 and T be uniquely determined from the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) knowing that transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\), the earlier application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\), which influences the entire trajectory, adds complexity. This, combined with the possible variations in control input \\\\(u\\\\) and its time-varying nature, makes it impossible to pinpoint a unique control input from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
