  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on a vector space, where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, analyze how the Fourier transform affects the signal when represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-2\\\\pi ist}x(t) dt \\\\). We examine the transformation sequences and their reversibility in different intervention scenarios.\n\nDoes applying the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) to a vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then computing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) yield the same result as applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) first and then applying a transformed version of \\\\( M \\\\) in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( M \\\\) prior to the Fourier transform modifies the time-domain signal and thus alters the frequency spectrum. A subsequent Fourier transform on the modulated signal \\\\( Mx(t) \\\\) does not correspond to just transforming the frequency components by \\\\( M \\\\), as the Fourier transform of a matrix transformation is not simply the matrix applied to the transformed data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying M to x(t) → Transforming x(t) into Mx; Applying the Fourier transform to x(t) → Transforming x(t) into F(s); Applying the Fourier transform to Mx → Transforming Mx into F(Mx); Applying a transformed version of M in the frequency domain → Transforming F(s) into F(Mx)"
