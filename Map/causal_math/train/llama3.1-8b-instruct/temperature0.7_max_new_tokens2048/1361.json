  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a change in the variable s defined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ke^{At} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and A is a non-zero constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( f(t) = t^k e^{(A+s)t} \\\\) at t = 0 and then transformed using \\\\( I(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( I(s) \\\\) solely depend on s, without being influenced by the change in k?",
  "Explanation": "Initial modification in function from \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{(A+s)t} \\\\) directly increases the decay rate in the exponent affecting the convergence of the integral. The change in k also affects the growth rate of t terms, thereby impacting both the convergence of the integral and the final form of \\\\( I(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "k → A; s → A; A → I(s); s → I(s); k → f(t); A → f(t); s → f(t); f(t) → I(s); I(s) → I(s)"
