  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We analyze the effect of complex conjugation on this function and any potential impacts on integral transformations of the resulting function over time t.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a function at t = T, can we deduce if the original input was \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or its transformation \\\\( f(z^*) \\\\) without any prior information on complex conjugation?",
  "Explanation": "The properties of the Fourier transform with respect to phase shifts make it difficult to uniquely identify the sign of the imaginary exponent in the original function, as both \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{-iz} \\\\) can lead to similar magnitude spectra but different phase spectra which may not be discernible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → input function; input function → complex conjugation; complex conjugation → f(z); complex conjugation → f(z^*); f(z) → f(z^*); f(z^*) → integral transformation; f(z^*) → output of Fourier transform; f(z) → output of Fourier transform; integral transformation → output of Fourier transform; output of Fourier transform → deduction of input function"
