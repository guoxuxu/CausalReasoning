  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) is subjected to a Fourier transform to become \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the PDE without additional transformations, will the state of the system \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T be solely determined by the modified initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition via Fourier transform alters the mode amplitudes and may shift the phase of components, directly setting a new base state for the solution of the PDE. The system's evolution will follow from this modified state, meaning its state at any time T is determined by this transformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
