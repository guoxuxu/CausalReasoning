  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a Holomorphic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane. The integral transformation is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we determine the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information about the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "The process of taking an integral transformation like \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) generally loses some information about the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Inversions are possible for certain classes of functions under specific conditions, but without knowledge of these conditions or the specific nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), exact retrieval is not guaranteed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
