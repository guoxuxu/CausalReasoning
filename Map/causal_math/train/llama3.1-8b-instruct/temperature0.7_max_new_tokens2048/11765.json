  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = K \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where K is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents a temperature distribution. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = u(x,t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) a positive constant, on the system dynamics over time.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation involving \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the exponential decay term \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates the observed data in a fundamental way that is inseparable without knowledge of \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\). Without this information, retracing to the exact initial distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) is ambiguous as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed effect due to the decay factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
