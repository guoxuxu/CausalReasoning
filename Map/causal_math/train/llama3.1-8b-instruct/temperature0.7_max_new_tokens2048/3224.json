  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive constant. We examine the consequence of applying a forcing function \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, on the system's response over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint response \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both) just by analyzing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions from the endpoint response alone is generally not feasible without additional data, as different combinations of forcing functions and initial conditions can yield equivalent results at T. The linear superposition principle in such linear systems entails that various configurations might lead to the same output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
