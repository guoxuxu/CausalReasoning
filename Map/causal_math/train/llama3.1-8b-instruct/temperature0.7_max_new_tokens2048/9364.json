  "Problem": "The behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) is studied, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. The impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\), where c is a real constant, is examined over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the constants a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will potentially be influenced by both transformations, and these influences are indistinguishable when considered only through the endpoint's value. Knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone, without information regarding the presence, timing, and specifics of each transformation, does not allow us to back-calculate which transformations were applied or their parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
