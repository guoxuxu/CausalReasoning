  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nCan the original complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be accurately deduced at t = 0 after observing an outcome at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is uncertain if the observed state results solely from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or from a subsequent transformation. The lack of knowledge about \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces ambiguities in deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
