  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of linear operators \\\\( L \\\\) on this system, defined by matrix multiplication on complex numbers in the form \\\\( Lz = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, creating \\\\( z'(0) = Mz_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( z'(0) = Mz_0 \\\\), and the subsequent evolution will be \\\\( z'(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z'(0) = e^{i\\\\omega t}Mz_0 \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( Me^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) unless \\\\( M \\\\) commutes with the evolution operator \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), which is typically not the case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
