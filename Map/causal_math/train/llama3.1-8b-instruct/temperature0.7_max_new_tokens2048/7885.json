  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain where \\\\(s\\\\) is the complex frequency. The circuit is initially characterized by an impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\). An operational intervention modifies the circuit's impedance to \\\\(Z_2(s) = Z_1(s) + \\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\Delta Z(s)\\\\) is another impedance term added.\n\nIf the initial impedance is \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) and no further changes are made to the circuit, will the response to a particular input signal remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, the system remains at its initial setup with impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\). Thus, the response to any given input signal will follow the behavior dictated by \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) without alteration, maintaining the same response characteristics over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "No further changes to the circuit → No change in the initial impedance Z1(s); Initial impedance Z1(s) → Circuit's impedance Z(s); Operational intervention → Change in impedance ΔZ(s); Change in impedance ΔZ(s) → New impedance Z2(s)"
