  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a system characterized by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. Then, an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T[x](t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(u) e^{-atu} du \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the output from the system after applying both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( T \\\\), recovering the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solely from the transformed output is generally indeterminate because the integral transformation could introduce attenuations, phase shifts, or other modifications that mask the original input characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
