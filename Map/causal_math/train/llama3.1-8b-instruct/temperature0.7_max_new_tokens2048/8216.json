  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum obtained from the Fourier transform of the damped function, \\\\( F(a, \\\\omega) \\\\), can we definitively determine whether the original function was damped and if so, by exactly what damping factor \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While a shift and broadening in the spectrum indicate damping, quantifying the exact damping factor solely from the spectrum can be challenging without additional data. Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can result in similar spectral profiles, especially considering potential measurement or estimation errors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
