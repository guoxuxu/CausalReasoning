  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a time-domain signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then analyzed using Fourier Transform without further intervention, will the frequency spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be solely determined by \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modifies the time-domain signal by introducing a frequency shift. This shift changes the frequency composition of the signal, resulting in a frequency spectrum that is not solely determined by the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\), but by the combination of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the effects of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
