  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the complex plane and a Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore the implications of modifying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( g(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and analyzing the resultant transformations and effects.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) for Re(s) > 0, can we uniquely determine that the original function was \\\\( t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) precisely corresponds to the Laplace Transform of \\\\( t^2 \\\\), and such a specific outcome doesn't arise from other typical elementary functions, enabling us to infer the original function uniquely under normal conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
