  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L: V \\\\rightarrow W \\\\) mapping between vector spaces V and W. We analyze the effect of a specific transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described as a multiplication by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), acting on vector space V before and after applying operator L.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( w \\\\) in W, can we determine whether the vector \\\\( v \\\\) was first transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) or not, without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about whether transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, and because transformations might not be detectable solely through output due to potential overlaps in L's action, it is indeterminable from \\\\( w \\\\) whether \\\\( T(v) \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
