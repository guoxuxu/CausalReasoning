  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) applied as a transformation on a time-dependent signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), producing a new signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\). Where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant representing angular frequency. This scenario explores the relation and transformation effect with and without interventions such as changing the frequency or applying a damping factor.\n\nBy directly evolving the transformed signal \\\\(y(t) = z(t) x(t)\\\\) from time 0 to T without any additional changes, will \\\\(y(T)\\\\) be identical to merely scaling \\\\(x(T)\\\\) with \\\\(e^{i \\\\omega T}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) is consistently applied through the duration, equivalent to scaling \\\\(x(t)\\\\) by \\\\(e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\) at each point in time. Therefore, at time T, \\\\(y(T)\\\\) is just \\\\(x(T)\\\\) scaled by \\\\(e^{i \\\\omega T}\\\\), as no additional transformations interfere.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
