  "Problem": "The scenario involves the eigenvalue problem in the evolution of a system under transformation. Given a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix, we examine its effects on the dynamics modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the initial complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the evolved state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of the complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have mapped multiple initial conditions to a similar final state due to the properties of the exponential map in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
