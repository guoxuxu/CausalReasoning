  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We examine the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new factor influencing the trajectory of the system, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not only on A and B but also significantly on C and D. The manner in which the transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) interact with the original system dynamics alters the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
