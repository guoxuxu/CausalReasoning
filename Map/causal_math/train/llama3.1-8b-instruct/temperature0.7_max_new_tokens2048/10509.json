  "Problem": "In the context of function analysis, consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial conditions and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) under the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nWhen varying matrix \\\\( A \\\\) while keeping \\\\( B \\\\) constant, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) directly reflect changes made to matrix \\\\( A \\\\) for all values of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of varying \\\\( A \\\\) is intertwined with the influence of \\\\( B \\\\) due to the additive nature of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is influenced by both exponential terms, the variation in \\\\( A \\\\) alone does not exclusively determine the transformed function at all frequencies, especially when interactions between the exponents become significant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
