  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) representing the solution to a system of linear differential equations with a matrix A. An external operator modifies the trajectory through a time-dependent matrix transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing the functional form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can the initial condition \\\\( x \\\\) be deduced accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of an unknown \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) as part of the evolution implies that the transformation incurred can be incompatible or non-invertible with respect to \\\\( A \\\\). Without knowing \\\\( B \\\\), it is impossible to reverse the effect of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) reliably to retrieve the initial \\\\( x \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T → z(T); x → z(T); B → z(T); A → z(T); B → g(t); g(t) → z(t); A → z(t); t → g(t); t → z(t)"
