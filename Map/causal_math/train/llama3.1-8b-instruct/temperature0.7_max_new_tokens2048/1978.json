  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Examine the influence of introducing an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int k(x, y)u(y)dy \\\\) where \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) solely from the observation of \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is impractical without knowledge of the application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) since the transformation might have altered the initial function in ways that are irreversible or not uniquely traceable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(t) → u(t) (temporal autocausality); u(t) → u(T); T(u) → u(T); u_0 → u(t); u_0 → T(u); k(x, y) → T(u); L → u(t)"
