  "Problem": "Consider the impact of applying a Fourier transform to a function \\\\( g(t)\\\\), resulting in \\\\( G(w) \\\\), and then investigating how this transform influences solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix. The situation explores the connection between the manipulation of function domains using integral transformations and their effect on dynamical system evolution.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately identify the specific interventions made to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) (like the addition of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) merely based on knowing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) results from complex interactions between \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( G(w) \\\\), and potentially \\\\( H(w) \\\\). Since multiple combinations of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) might yield the same or sufficiently similar state vectors at \\\\( x(T) \\\\), determining exact interventions based solely on the endpoint is not feasible without more detailed spectral or contextual information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
