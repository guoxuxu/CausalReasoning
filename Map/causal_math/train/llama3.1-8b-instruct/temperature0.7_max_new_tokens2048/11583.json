  "Problem": "Consider the response space of a signal processing system, modeled by the integral transform \\( Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\), known as the Laplace transform. We explore the effect of modifying the input signal \\( x(t) \\) by a function \\( f(x) = e^{At}x(t) \\), where A is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(x) = R(t)x(t) \\) (where \\( R(t) \\) is another modulation function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( Y(s) \\) for s > 0 depend only on \\( Y(s) \\) and not on A or R?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(x) \\) introduces another modifying factor to the input \\( x(t) \\), making the final Laplace transform \\( Y(s) \\) depend on \\( A \\), due to the initial \\( f(x) \\), and \\( R \\), due to \\( g(x) \\). The transformations interact and affect the system's response, showing dependencies beyond just the original transform equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
