  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. Evaluate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the output after time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing it follows the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), can we precisely infer the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if there was an application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depends on an integration across the function's evolution, this aggregation obfuscates the direct traceability back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Individual characteristics of the original state are obscured by the integral, making it impossible to reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely without explicit knowledge of having not applied \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
