  "Problem": "We consider an electrical system modeled by a complex function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), representing the impedance as a function of complex frequency \\\\( s \\\\). An intervention is applied by modifying the system impedance through an additional component described as \\\\( H(s) = e^{-st}Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nDoes the operation of initial impedance \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without intervention yield the same transfer function characteristic at a variable point \\\\( s = j\\\\omega \\\\) compared to when the modified impedance \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is applied and then left to evolve?",
  "Explanation": "The modification brought by \\\\( H(s) = e^{-st}Z(s) \\\\) introduces a decay factor to the impedance that alters the frequency response properties of the system. This change in impedance due to the exponential factor directly affects the system's behavior over time, leading to different characteristics at any frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
