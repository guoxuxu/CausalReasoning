  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) in a rod and time \\( t \\) obeys the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) with thermal conductivity \\( k \\). We investigate the application of a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(x,t)) \\) to convert spatial components of the heat distribution into the frequency domain at time \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nWill the distribution \\( T(x,T) \\) at time \\( T > 0 \\) be the same if \\( T(x,0) \\) is subjected to the Fourier transform initially compared to not applying \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) initially alters \\( T(x,0) \\) by converting it to the frequency domain, affecting how the heat propagates due to the change in initial conditions. The subsequent evolution under the heat equation leads to a different temperature distribution at time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
