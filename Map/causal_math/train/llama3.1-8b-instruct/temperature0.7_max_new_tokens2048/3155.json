  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is adjusted to a new function \\\\( v(t) \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original system matrices A, B, C, D and not on the transformation \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention via changing the control input to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) adds a new dynamic to the system, but the previous application of \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) still influences the system due to its integrative and accumulative properties. Thus, the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the new input and the earlier transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
