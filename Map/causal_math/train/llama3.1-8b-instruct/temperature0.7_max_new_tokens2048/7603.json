  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a linear transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is the initial vector. We examine the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(y) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}y(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(y) = e^{Ct}y \\\\) (where C is another complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(y) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\) a product of the interactions between A, B, and C. The changes induced by C from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward affect the trajectory initiated by A and modified by B, thus affecting the endpoint state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
