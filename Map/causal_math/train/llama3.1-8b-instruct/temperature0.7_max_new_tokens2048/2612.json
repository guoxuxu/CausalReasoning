  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where demand (d) and supply (s) functions for a market are governed by the parameters of a time-dependent differential equation system \\\\(\\\\dot{d} = Ad(t)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{s} = As(t)\\\\) respectively, with A being a negative constant that controls decay rate. The market is subjected to periodic economic swings described by a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) impacting both supply and demand, where B is a positive constant matrix showing growth over time.\n\nGiven the state of the market at time T, can we definitively determine what interventions (\\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the values at T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping impacts of exponential growth (B) and decay (C), alongside standard decay (A), make it difficult to ascertain directly from the market state at time T which interventions were applied as multiple combinations of these transformations can yield similar end states. Differences in parameter magnitudes and interaction dynamics further obscure the causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → decay rate; B → growth rate; f(t) → growth; g(t) → unknown; supply(s) → demand(d); f(t) → supply(s); f(t) → demand(d); decay rate → supply(s); decay rate → demand(d); growth rate → supply(s); growth rate → demand(d); supply(s) → equilibrium; demand(d) → equilibrium; equilibrium → market state at T"
