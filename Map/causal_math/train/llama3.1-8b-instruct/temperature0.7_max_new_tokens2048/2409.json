  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining a trajectory in the complex plane over time t. Let there be a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T be equal to the trajectory tracing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) rotated by \\\\( \\\\omega T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) at initial time rotates the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a phase \\\\( \\\\omega t \\\\). Without further intervention, the transformation simply adds a constant rotation at each time point resulting in a trajectory that is a rotated version of the original trajectory by \\\\( \\\\omega T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
