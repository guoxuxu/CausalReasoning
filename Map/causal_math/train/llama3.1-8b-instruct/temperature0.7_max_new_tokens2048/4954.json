  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) by applying \\\\( f(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. This scenario explores how this transformation, particularly the Laplace transform, affects causal inference in a system's response.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) accurately after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Laplace transform \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if and how the Laplace transform was applied, it is impossible to ensure the reconstruction of \\\\( u_0(t) \\\\) due to the irreversible information alteration in the s-domain representation. This transform significantly abstracts and potentially compresses the time-domain features necessary for accurate reconstruction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
