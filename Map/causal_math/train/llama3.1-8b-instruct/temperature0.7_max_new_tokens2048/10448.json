  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We explore the impact of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\) over time t, where M is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied is complicated by the fact that exponential transformations in the complex plane can have non-trivial effects due to their ability to scale and rotate a complex number. Multiple combinations of M and N might result in the same or indistinguishably similar end states at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), thereby precluding a unique determination of the transformative history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
