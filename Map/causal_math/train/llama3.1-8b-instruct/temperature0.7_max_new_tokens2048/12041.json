  "Problem": "In a control system, an input vector \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is transformed using a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) to produce an output \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\). An additional operator \\\\(M\\\\), a constant matrix, is later used to alter the system's response.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\), can we uniquely identify whether \\\\(x(t)\\\\) was the sole contributor to \\\\(y(t)\\\\) without knowledge of any additional operations like \\\\(M\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on additional operations like \\\\(M\\\\), it's uncertain if the output \\\\(y(t)\\\\) resulted solely from \\\\(x(t)\\\\) or was modified by \\\\(M\\\\). Hence, the actual contributor to \\\\(y(t)\\\\) remains indeterministic without full knowledge of the applied operators.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
