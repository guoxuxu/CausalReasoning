  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit composed of a resistor (R), inductor (L), capacitor (C), and a power source that applies a voltage \\\\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The system is described by the differential equation \\\\( V(t) = L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int_0^t I(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is the current as a function of time.\n\nIf the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the voltage source is doubled from \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\\\omega_0 \\\\) at the start, without any other intervention, will the steady state impedance observed in the circuit be the same as if \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was kept at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the frequency of the voltage source affects the impedance of the circuit due to the frequency-dependent behavior of the inductor and capacitor. The impedance of the circuit, given by \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = R + i(\\\\omega L - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\omega C}) \\\\), will differ, indicating different current response characteristics at different frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
