  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nBased on the observed data in the frequency domain, can we infer the exact time-domain signal \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without knowing the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform converts time-domain data into its frequency components. Without the angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), it is impossible to reconstruct the timing or phase information accurately, as \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) determines the periodicity of the original oscillatory function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
