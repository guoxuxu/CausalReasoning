  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation considered is applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were undertaken (whether \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\), or both) solely based on \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple physically plausible sequences of transformations and natural evolution under the heat equation could lead to the same observed end state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\). Without additional data on the interventions, these cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
