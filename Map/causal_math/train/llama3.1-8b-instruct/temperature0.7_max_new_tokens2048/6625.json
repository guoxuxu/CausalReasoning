  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, representing the real and imaginary parts of the exponent, respectively. We examine the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on this function and how alterations to parameters impact the system dynamics.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then modify the constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at s = S be the same as if the original function with unchanged constants was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) alters the fundamental behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), thus affecting the Laplace transformation output. Both the scale and the frequency components of the original function are modified by changes in \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), which influence the poles and zeros in the transformed domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
