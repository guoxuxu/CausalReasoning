  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a 2x2 matrix. Evaluate the effects of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L\\{f(t)\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt \\\\) on this system at different stages.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) be deduced accurately after observing its transformed state using Laplace transformation at a later time T without knowledge of P?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform provides a frequency-domain representation of the entire function, but the inversion to recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) requires knowledge of the transformation matrix P. Without this, it's impossible to determine how the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved to reach the observed transformed state at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
