  "Problem": "Investigate the response function R(z) in a complex system, where \\\\( R(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), with complex coefficients a and b. The system's behavior is probed using a transformation \\\\( T(s) = e^{st} \\\\) where s is a complex number and t represents time.\n\nConsidering only the output z = U(q) at any subsequent time after intervention with \\\\( U(q) \\\\), can the type of intervention (whether it was \\\\( T(s) \\\\), \\\\( U(q) \\\\), or both) be uniquely identified?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only z = U(q) without additional context doesn't provide enough information to uniquely trace back to which interventions were used. The transformations lead to potentially overlapping outcomes, and without discrete knowledge of temporal alignments and specific complex numbers used, it’s impossible to specify the exact nature of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
