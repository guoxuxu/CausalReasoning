  "Problem": "Analyze the input-output relationship in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by the system function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants. Evaluate the impact of applying a Laplace transform, which translates the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain operation.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), can we determine the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) knowing only \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and assuming no modifications in system or input over time?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information on \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), and with multiple possible inputs leading to the same \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) due to the properties of convolution and integrals in transforms, one cannot definitively deduce the exact \\\\( x(t) \\\\) used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
