  "Problem": "Consider a system of coupled linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Now introduce a change of basis driven by a matrix function \\\\( P(t) \\\\), leading to a new variable \\\\( y = P(t)x \\\\). Analyze the transformation's impacts under various scenarios.\n\nIf the change of basis \\\\( P(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is enforced at t = 0 on the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\), leading to an initial condition \\\\( y_0 = P(0)x_0 \\\\), will the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to solving \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( P(t) \\\\) alters the initial conditions and the transformation \\\\( y = P(t)x \\\\) involves a matrix exponential that modifies the evolution path of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a manner dependent on both A and B. The solutions will only coincide if specific relationships between A and B hold, such as commutativity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
