  "Problem": "In a complex domain, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The time evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider alterations in this system's behavior by applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant.\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) could have changed the initial conditions in a way that is not recoverable from just observing the endpoint, due to the exponential interaction with the system's dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
