  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the effects of transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain exactly which interventions (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential nature of the transformations allows for various combinations of scaling and damping to produce the same end state. Thus, multiple intervention scenarios can potentially yield the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to definitively determine the applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
