  "Problem": "Consider a linear integral transformation given by \\\\(I[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} K(t, s) f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) is a kernel function. We investigate the impact of a control function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) added to the input function \\\\( f(s) \\\\), resulting in a modified input \\\\( f(s) + h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), a control function \\\\( h(s) = e^{-s} \\\\) is applied, will the transformed output \\\\( I[f(t)] \\\\) be independent of the initial function \\\\( f(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( h(s) = e^{-s} \\\\) as an intervention modifies the input, but the output \\\\( I[f(t)] \\\\) still depends on both the initial function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) and the control function due to the properties of linear superpositions in integral transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
