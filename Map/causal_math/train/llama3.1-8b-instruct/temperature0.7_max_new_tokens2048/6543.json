  "Problem": "Analyzing the system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) applied to the function u(x, t), and how it evolves over time.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(u) = u * v\\\\) (convolution with some function v) is applied as an intervention during the evolution at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution intervention \\\\( u * v \\\\) when transformed into Fourier space becomes a multiplication, which alters the spectral components of the function. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) depends not only on L but also significantly on the Fourier transform of v, indicating that the output is influenced by both the original operator and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
