  "Problem": "Consider a nonlinear system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax^2 + Bx + C \\\\), where A, B, and C are constants. We explore the system's behavior with the initial condition \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\) and a transformation defined by \\\\( f(x) = Dxe^{Et} \\\\), where D and E are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, resulting in a new initial condition, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T deviate from the trajectory had no transformation been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Dx_0e^{E \\\\cdot 0} = Dx_0 \\\\), affecting the trajectory right from the onset. Since the differential equation is nonlinear, even a slight change in the initial condition leads to markedly different trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
