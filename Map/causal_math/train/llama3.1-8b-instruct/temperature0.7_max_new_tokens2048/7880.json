  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as the complex integral transform of a real function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number with a real part that ensures convergence. The causal relationship between function modifications and their effect on the integral transform output is explored.\n\nObserving a damping profile in \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we conclusively determine that the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was modified expressly by the exponential damping intervention with a specific \\\\( \\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although the damping effect is evident, asserting that a specific damping was used just from the transform outcome is unreliable. Other forms of modifications in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could yield similar damping patterns in \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Precise knowledge of the intervention requires more specific data than just the damping nature observable in the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "damping intervention → exponential decay in z(t); exponential decay in z(t) → damping profile; damping profile → modification in x(t); modification in x(t) → damping intervention"
