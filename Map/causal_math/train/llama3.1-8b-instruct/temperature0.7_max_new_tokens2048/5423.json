  "Problem": "Consider a curved surface in the 3D space described by the equation \\( z = f(x,y) \\). We explore the effect of multiple complex transformations on this surface. Specifically, we look at transformations represented by \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) where C is a constant complex matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a new transformation \\( h(z) = z + Dz \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, applied at time \\( t_1 \\), will the final form of the surface at \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on the initial function \\( f(x,y) \\) and not on \\( C \\) or \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(z) = z + Dz \\) introduces another complexity level, adapting and potentially modifying the effects already imparted by \\( e^{Cz} \\). The resultant surface at \\( T \\) will reflect influences from both the initial function and transformations \\( C \\) and \\( D \\), complicating predictions about final surface characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
