  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a function \\\\( z = f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 5 \\\\). We deploy an operator transformation \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^z t dt \\\\) over the domain of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at some point \\\\( x_1 \\\\) to a new function \\\\( g(x) = x^4 - x + 1 \\\\) and we then apply \\\\( T \\\\), will the outcome \\\\( T(g(x)) \\\\) at any point depend solely on the transformed function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) altering its polynomial structure, which means the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) applied afterward is affected by the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) rather than \\\\( f(x) \\\\). However, if the intervention at \\\\( x_1 \\\\) influences the conditions or coefficients used in \\\\( g(x) \\\\) as related to initial conditions set by \\\\( f(x) \\\\), then the outcome still indirectly depends on both functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
