  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\) applied to the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) where x is a spatial variable.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Laplace Transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the Laplace Transform, it is impossible to reliably infer \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) as the transformation might have affected the spectral characteristics inherent in \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The result at t = T might correspond to multiple initial conditions due to the properties of transformation in the complex domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
