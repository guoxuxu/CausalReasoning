  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The integral transformation maps the time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different complex values of \\\\( s \\\\) is of interest.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a simple exponential like \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number, will the resulting function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is directly computable and yields \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where the dependency is only on parameters \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). No other factors influence \\\\( h(z) \\\\) in this specific case without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
