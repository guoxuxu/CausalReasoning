  "Problem": "Imagine a system modeled by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time. We evaluate the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint z(T), can the exact sequence of transformations applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) be determined precisely only by knowing z(T)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint z(T) can potentially be produced by various combinations of transformations due to the continuous nature and additive exponents of the transformations. The effects of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) could overlap or counterbalance each other, making it difficult to deduce the history of transformations only from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
