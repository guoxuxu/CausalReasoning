  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the system's state at time t. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform, designated as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), a complex function in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without additional information about initial conditions or specific functional forms?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, while providing a transformed view of the function into the s-domain, may correspond to multiple time-domain functions if boundary conditions and specific system information are not fully known. Essential details about initial conditions or possible discontinuities in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) are necessary to precisely reverse-engineer \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
