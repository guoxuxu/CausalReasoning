  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system defined by \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. Evaluate the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nBased on knowing the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we determine which transformations (\\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), or both) were applied during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact series or types of transformations based solely on the end state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is not feasible, because different combinations of C and D can potentially yield the same final state due to possible overlapping effects in the matrix transformation paths.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
