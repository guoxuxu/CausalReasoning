  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda+i\\omega)t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) are real constants representing growth and oscillation parameters respectively. We will explore the impacts of applying a Laplace transform to this function and its inverse.\n\nGiven \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) derived from \\\\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda+i\\omega)t}\\\\), is it possible to deduce the parameters \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\(\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\(Z(s)\\\\). The Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(\\lambda + i\\omega)}\\\\) clearly encapsulates these parameters, allowing them to be extracted directly even without prior knowledge of \\\\(z(t)\\\\)'s form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
