  "Problem": "Consider the influence of an external magnetic field B on a particle with charge q and the trajectory described by the vector position function \\\\( r(t) \\). Assume the magnetic field introduces a force per unit charge represented by the vector function \\\\( F(t) = qv(t) \\\\times B \\), where \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is the velocity vector of the particle at time t and \\\\times denotes the cross product.\n\nGiven the final position \\\\( r(T) \\\\) and knowing interventions occurred, can we definitively conclude whether the original trajectory included the magnetic field influence or solely the interventions shaped the trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "The final position alone, given interventions like applied opposing forces, does not provide enough information to discern if the original state included the magnetic field's influence, as interventions could mimic or counteract the field's effect, leading to identical endpoints from different causal histories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
