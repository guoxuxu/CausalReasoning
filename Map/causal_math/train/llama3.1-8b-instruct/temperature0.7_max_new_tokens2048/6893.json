  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions derived from the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nWill the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, result in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) being identical to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) evolving directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the system's equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by altering both the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), hence changing the trajectory in the complex plane. The outcome at time T will vary as the matrices A, B, and C can influence the system's behavior differently due to their potentially non-commutative nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
