  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. We examine the interactions between the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and a linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) on function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nCan we deduce the initial form of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing its Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( L \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( L \\), the transformation that \\( L \\) introduces, specifically the multiplication by \\( t \\), significantly alters the frequency content, making it difficult to reconstruct the original \\( z(t) \\) from the Fourier transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
