  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a system characterized by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. Then, an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T[x](t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(u) e^{-atu} du \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervening filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\), another transfer function, is applied after \\\\( T \\\\) at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the resulting output at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) solely depend on the initial application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) can alter the output in significant ways depending on its properties and how it interacts with the effects of \\\\( T \\\\) and the initial system characterized by \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Therefore, the final output is influenced by all components: \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
