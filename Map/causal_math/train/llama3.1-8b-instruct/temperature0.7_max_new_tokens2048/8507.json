  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), and A and B are scalar constants. We explore causal relationships under the Fourier transform defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied where a scaling function \\\\(s(t) = e^{Ct}\\\\) is multiplied to z(t) at a time t_1, will the new state \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\) reflect only the impact of A and B or also C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the scaling function \\\\(s(t) = e^{Ct}\\\\) affects the subsequent evolution of the function by introducing a new exponential factor, significantly altering the response characteristics captured in \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega)\\\\). Thus, the new transformation reflects A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
