  "Problem": "Consider a signal process represented by a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = L\\{z(t)\\} \\), where \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of an input signal modified by the transformation \\( h(t) = e^{Bt} \\) on the system's response over time t, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the system's state \\( z(T) \\), can we accurately determine what interventions (whether \\( h(t) \\), \\( g(t) \\), or both) were used, solely from the final state \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) can result from various sequences or combinations of interventions due to the overlapping potential dynamics introduced by matrix exponentials. The complex interplay between the transformations makes it challenging to unequivocally identify the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
