  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which represents a unit circle parametrized by time t. Analyze how the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\), is influenced by the introduction of a phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) in the function, defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi)} \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different phase shift \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) as an intervention, and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) becomes \\\\( e^{i(t + \\\\psi)} \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform at any point s be determined solely by \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shifts \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) at different times contribute cumulatively to the evolution of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), hence affecting the Laplace transform of the whole function. The transform is dependent not just on the original function, but also on how and when the phase shifts were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
