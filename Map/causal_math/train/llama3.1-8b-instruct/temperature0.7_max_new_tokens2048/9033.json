  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) evolving in time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex \\( s \\), is analyzed.\n\nIf the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) (where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition) evolves without any intervention, will the transform \\( T(z) \\) directly yield the same result irrespective of the choice of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\( T(z) \\) heavily depends on the relation between \\( \\omega \\) and the real part of \\( s \\). Specifically, the integral convergence is conditional, depending on whether the real part of \\( s \\) is greater than \\( \\omega \\). Thus, changing \\( \\omega \\) or \\( s \\) can yield different results, indicating dependency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
