  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system in a complex plane under the influence of an external force and initial conditions. The position of a particle in the complex plane is described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the position, respectively, in time t. The position is further affected by the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to a position \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then the position evolves according to the mechanics of the system without further intervention, will the position \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) at the beginning modifies the initial condition by rotating it in the complex plane. This rotation changes the subsequent trajectory of the position, resulting in a different position at any later time T than if it were evolved without the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
