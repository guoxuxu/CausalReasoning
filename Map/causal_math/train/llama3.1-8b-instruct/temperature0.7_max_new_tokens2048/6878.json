  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant matrix, over the time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can we conclusively trace back and determine the initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The complex transformation \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) may have been applied initially, significantly changing the initial conditions that cannot be deterministically reverse engineered without explicit knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\). The influence of \\\\( M \\\\) adds an additional complex layer of dynamics, erasing a straightforward retracement to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
