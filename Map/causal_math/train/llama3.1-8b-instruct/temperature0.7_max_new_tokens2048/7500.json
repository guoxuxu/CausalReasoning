  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation being considered is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nConsidering the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can the specific nature of the interventions (whether \\\\( f(z), g(z), \\\\) or both) be definitively determined just by knowing the outcome at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects of the transformations \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\) which can result in the same composite transformation under different combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), it is difficult to pinpoint exactly which interventions were applied based solely on the endpoint data \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
