  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time, under the influence of a transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nCan we accurately determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it's impossible to confidently trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the transformation could have altered its amplitude and phase, and multiple initial states can evolve to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the properties of exponential functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
