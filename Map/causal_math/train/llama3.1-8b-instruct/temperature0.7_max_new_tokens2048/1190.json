  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The function transforms according to another complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\). The system's development is examined over time under the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and the results are compared to an untransformed approach.\n\nCan we infer the original function form at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) accurately after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was implemented?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and the absence of it result in different trajectories, the ending state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone doesn't give direct evidence concerning whether the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied or not without the additional knowledge of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
