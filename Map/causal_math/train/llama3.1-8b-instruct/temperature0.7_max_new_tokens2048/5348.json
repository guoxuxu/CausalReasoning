  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, where the transform of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\). The analysis investigates the effect of manipulating the function before transforming it using a multiplier function \\\\(g(t) = e^{At}t^k\\\\) where A is a real constant and k is an integer.\n\nKnowing the end result of the Laplace Transform, can we pinpoint exactly which functions were applied (whether \\\\(g(t)\\\\), \\\\(h(t)\\\\), both or none) based only on the transformed output?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of transformations such as exponential growth and decay introduced by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) can yield similar transforms for different underlying modifications. Consequently, multiple combinations of interventions might lead to indistinguishable outcomes in the transform domain, making it challenging to precisely identify which functions were applied to \\\\(f(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
