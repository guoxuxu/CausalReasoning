  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of the Fourier transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time T, can we infer the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without any knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform obscures temporal details due to its integral nature over all time; specific information about the initial state at t = 0 cannot be accurately reconstructed without additional information about the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or other contextual factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
