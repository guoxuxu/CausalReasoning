  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state vector. We investigate the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix, applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf during the system evolution, another operation \\\\( k(z) = De^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) and not on matrices \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new dynamic in the form of \\\\( k(z) \\\\), influencing the evolution of the state under \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the compounded interaction among all these transformations, significantly depending on how matrices \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\) interplay, rather than on just \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
