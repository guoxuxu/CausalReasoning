  "Problem": "We examine a fluid dynamics setting where the flow velocity vector field \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\\\\) is influenced by the Navier-Stokes equation under an applied external force \\\\(\\\\vec{f}(x, y, z, t)\\\\). Consider the complex transformation of the force field, defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{f}(x, y, z, t))(s)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) denotes the Laplace transform in the x-direction.\n\nDoes the application of the Laplace transformed external force \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t)\\\\) at time t = 0 lead to a directly proportional change in the flow velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(x, y, z, t)\\\\) at time t = T under the unaltered Navier-Stokes equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed force field \\\\(\\\\hat{f}(s, y, z, t)\\\\) affects the system indirectly since the velocity field's response is governed by both the original and transformed properties of \\\\(\\\\vec{f}\\\\) through the Navier-Stokes equation. This causal relationship is mediated by complex dynamical processes, making proportional change not straightforward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
