  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition. We look into the effects of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse affect the function over time t.\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is taken at t = 0 and allowed to evolve based on the properties of the Laplace transform without further intervention, will the inverse transform at any time t = T be precisely the original function \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are precisely designed to reconstruct the original function from its transformed state. Thus, applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then taking the inverse transform will yield the original function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without alteration, provided all conditions for the transforms are met (convergence, etc.).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
