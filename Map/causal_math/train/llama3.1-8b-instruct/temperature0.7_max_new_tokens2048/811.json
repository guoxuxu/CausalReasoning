  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear PDE \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the influence of applying the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) \\\\, dt\\\\), on the function u(t).\n\nIf an intervention by modifying the differential operator to \\\\(M\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), then will \\\\(F(s, T)\\\\) at T > t_1 depend solely on L and not M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the governing differential operator from L to M, which means the dynamics of the system are altered. The resulting function \\\\(F(s, T)\\\\) would now reflect the influence of both L (before \\\\(t_1\\\\)) and M (after \\\\(t_1\\\\)), materially affecting the transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the Laplace transform to u(t) does not depend on the differential operator M if the intervention by modifying M is applied at time t1, but rather on the initial conditions and the original differential operator L."
