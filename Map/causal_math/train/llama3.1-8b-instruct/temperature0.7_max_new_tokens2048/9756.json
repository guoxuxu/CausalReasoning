  "Problem": "Consider a system where the variable \\\\(z\\\\) is transformed by the complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\\\). We analyze the outcome of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence \\\\(z_n\\\\) where \\\\(n = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\\\) and its implications on the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z)\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the specific transformations used (\\\\(f(z)\\\\) or \\\\(g(z)\\\\) or both) by analyzing the spectrum obtained from the DFT of the final transformed sequence?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of the transformations and their non-linear effects on the sequence and its spectrum, multiple different transformation sequences could potentially yield the same or indistinguishably similar spectra. Additionally, the loss of information about the original amplitude and phase in each step prevents precise backtracking of the specific transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
