  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a square matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another square matrix.\n\nAssuming an intervention in the form of a linear operator \\\\( L(z) = Dz \\\\), with \\\\( D \\\\) a constant matrix applied at a certain time \\\\( t_k \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_k \\\\) depend solely on the initial matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_k \\\\) introduces a new dynamic in the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) influenced by the matrices \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\). The interaction of these matrices and the timing of the intervention significantly affect the trajectory and the eventual outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
