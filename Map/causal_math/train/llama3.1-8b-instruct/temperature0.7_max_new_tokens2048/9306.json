  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system's state over time t. An integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) characterized by the kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\) is applied, influencing the evolution according to the formula \\\\(Tz(t) = \\\\int K(s, t) z(s) ds\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed function \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) without additional information about the kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing the original function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) from its transformed state \\\\(Tz(t)\\\\) generally requires knowledge of the kernel \\\\(K(s, t)\\\\). Without this, the transformation lacks invertibility as there could be multiple potential functions that lead to the same outcome under different kernels.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
