  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing the angular frequency and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an initially real-valued function. The impact of Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is studied to understand its transformation properties and the system behavior.\n\nKnowing the final Laplace transform after multiple interventions, can we determine the specific sequence or type of interventions applied when changing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant Laplace transform after various interventions may result from different sequences of changes to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or frequency adjustments due to the continuous and overlapping nature of these transformations in the complex and Laplace domain. Deducing the exact sequence or types of interventions from the final transform alone is indeterminate without additional trajectory markers or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
