  "Problem": "Assume a linear transformation system controlled by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) applied to a set of differential equations. We explore scenarios involving both the initial application of transforms and subsequent interventions through inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}[F(s)] \\\\) at different stages.\n\nIf we observe the transformed state \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at some future time T, can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing if an inverse transform was applied at any time?",
  "Explanation": "The relationship established by the Laplace transform is bijective as long as the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) meet the conditions necessary for the transform's existence. This allows the unique determination of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) regardless of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
