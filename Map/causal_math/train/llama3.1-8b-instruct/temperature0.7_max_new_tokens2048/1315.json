  "Problem": "Consider a functional system governed by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the alterations in system behavior by introducing an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that modifies the integral operation.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the integral operation in \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( f'(x) = \\int_0^x u(t)e^{t^2} dt \\\\) (with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) a time-varying function), will the outcome of \\\\( g(f'(x_1)) \\\\) for some \\\\( x_1 \\\\) solely depend on the new formulation of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on original \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the integral's nature through the modulation by \\\\( u(t) \\\\), introducing new dynamics. While the final state depends significantly on the new function \\\\( f'(x) \\\\), one cannot fully exclude the effects of the original formulation without knowing more about the dependencies or the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
