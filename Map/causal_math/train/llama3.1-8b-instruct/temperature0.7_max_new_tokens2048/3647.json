  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z + \\\\alpha \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant complex number. Study the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i \\\\omega s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) over a time interval [0, T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( H(z) = e^{-i \\\\omega t_1}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original differential equation parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the impact of \\\\( H(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( H(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by introducing a phase shift specific to the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) at which it was applied. This shift affects the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the trajectory dependent not only on the original parameters but also significantly on the timing and nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
