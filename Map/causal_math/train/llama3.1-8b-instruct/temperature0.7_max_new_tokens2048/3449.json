  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the scenario where an integral transform \\\\( K(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(x, s)u(s, t) ds \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) being a kernel function.\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\( K(u) \\\\) is applied at initial time t = 0 to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\), and then the system is evolved according to \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform changes the initial condition, hence affecting the evolution of the system. The function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) transformed by \\\\( K(u) \\\\) initially deviates from the simple evolution under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\), leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
