  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix representing the system dynamics and \\\\( N \\\\) is a control input matrix. A transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dx} \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix) is studied for its effects on the system.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The potential application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) alters the initial state in a way that might not be uniquely reversible, especially since the effect of \\\\( D \\\\) on the trajectory can't be isolated without explicit knowledge of its application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
