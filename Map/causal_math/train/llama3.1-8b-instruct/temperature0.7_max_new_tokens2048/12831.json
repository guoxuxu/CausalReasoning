  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the z-plane, where z is a complex number, and is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We evaluate the effects of a transformation involving a linear operator T applied to the function, where \\\\( T(f(z)) = f'(z) \\\\), the derivative of the function.\n\nObserving the post-intervention outputs of the system at various points, can we decisively infer whether the original function or the intervention-induced function was used at specific points without a priori knowledge of the starting function and the type of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the complexities in back-calculating the original function from its derivatives in general cases, the introduction of an intervention (new function form) adds additional layers of ambiguity. Without explicit knowledge of the nature of the intervention or the starting function, definitively determining the intervention or the function form at different points based just on outputs becomes impractical.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → f(z); z → f'(z); f(z) → T(f(z)); f(z) → T(f'(z)); T(f(z)) → f'(z); f'(z) → T(f'(z))"
