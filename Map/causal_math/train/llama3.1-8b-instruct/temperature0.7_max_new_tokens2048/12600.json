  "Problem": "Assume a system of partial differential equations governing heat flow in a rod, described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where u is the temperature and k is the diffusion constant. Explore the consequences of applying a temperature-dependent transformation \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda u} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied initially to a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), then allowed to evolve by the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly subjected to the heat equation to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) changes the initial temperature profile, creating a non-linear alteration due to the exponential factor. This difference in initial conditions propagates through the system influenced by the heat equation, resulting in a distinct temperature profile at any later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
