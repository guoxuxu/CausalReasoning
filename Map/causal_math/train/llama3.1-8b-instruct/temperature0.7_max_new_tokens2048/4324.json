  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being different constant matrices. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to determine exactly what transformations (whether \\\\( T[z] \\\\), \\\\( U[z] \\\\), or both) were used by only knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interaction of matrix exponentials (A, B, C, D) in influencing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), various combinations of transformations can result in equivalent endpoints at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This overlap makes it difficult to uniquely ascertain the history of transformations used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
