  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a square matrix. We explore the system's response under the integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) where N is another constant matrix and t is a parameter for duration.\n\nIf a corrective linear operation \\\\( U(z) = Pz \\\\) (where P is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on M and not on N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( U(z) \\\\) introduces an additional dynamic influenced by matrix P. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) therefore becomes a function of the original matrix M, the initial transformation matrix N, and the intervention matrix P, influencing how states evolve from the intervention point onward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
