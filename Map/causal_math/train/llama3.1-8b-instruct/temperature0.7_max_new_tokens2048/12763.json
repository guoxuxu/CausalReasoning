  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) governing a field \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) across space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = L u\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. We analyze the behavior of the field under the transformation \\\\(v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)]\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) involves applying an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform.\n\nCan we accurately determine which transformations (\\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), or both) were used and when, given the observation of the field \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) may correspond to multiple potential scenarios involving different timings and applications of the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\). Without additional context or constraints, the specific interventions cannot be uniquely identified from the endpoint data alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
