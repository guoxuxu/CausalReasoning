  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the impact of an initial heat distribution described by \\\\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\\\), a predefined function, and the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{h}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega x}h(x) dx \\\\) on this distribution.\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution at a later time t > 0, \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original distribution \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The forward evolution of the heat equation is diffusive, which tends to smooth and disperse the initial temperature profile over time. This dispersion makes it inherently challenging to reverse engineer the original precise profile \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from the diffused state at a later time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
