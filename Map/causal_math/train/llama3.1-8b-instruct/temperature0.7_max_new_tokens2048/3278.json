  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a function of time. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the shifted Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\), can we definitively attribute this shift to the multiplication of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in the transformed function \\\\( F(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\) suggests a possible multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), but without additional data on the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or consideration of other possible transformations or external influences, we cannot assert causation definitively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Multiplying f(t) by e^αt → Shift in the variable of the Laplace transform; Multiplying f(t) by e^αt → Changing the argument of the Laplace transform; e^αt → Multiplying f(t) → Shift in the variable of the Laplace transform → Changing the argument of the Laplace transform"
