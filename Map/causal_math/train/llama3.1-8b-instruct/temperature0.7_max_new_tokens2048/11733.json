  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\Delta u\\\\) governs the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) over a domain, with constant thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\). We investigate the impact of a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,t))\\\\), and analyze its influence on temperature evolution.\n\nHaving observed \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) without knowing the details of the intervening computations?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\), the inverse Fourier transform can be applied to retrieve \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), and by knowing the reversibility of the heat equation under certain conditions, one can compute backwards to determine \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\). This is provided the transformation remained unaltered apart from the standard evolution of the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
