  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\), where D represents a diffusion constant. We also consider the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a wave number.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the solution as directly evolved from \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) to \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_x^2 u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is a linear operation on \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) and does not alter the boundary or initial conditions applicable under the diffusion equation. The PDE is linear and homogenous, ensuring that the transformation and the diffusion process commute. Therefore, \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will be the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
