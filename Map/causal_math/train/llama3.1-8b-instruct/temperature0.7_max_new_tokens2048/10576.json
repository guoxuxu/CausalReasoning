  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to this system.\n\nKnowing the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the intervention constants \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The information encapsulated in \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) at time T contains effects of both the initial conditions and the intervention constants. Without additional information about either the initial conditions or the exact form of intervention, it's impossible to uniquely back-calculate the values of \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\). Different interventions can produce similar transforms, making it indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
