  "Problem": "Consider a system where the rate of heat transfer \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along the rod. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is a constant heating term, is applied to the rod's temperature distribution.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is initially applied to the temperature distribution and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at a later time t be the same as if \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was not applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\) increases the initial temperature uniformly by h. This changes the initial condition of the heat equation and thus the evolution of the temperature distribution over time, resulting in a different \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
