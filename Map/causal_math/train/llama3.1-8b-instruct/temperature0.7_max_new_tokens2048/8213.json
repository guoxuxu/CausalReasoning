  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and its integral transformation using a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) transformed by Fourier transform, will the spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) be a delta function centered at the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is indeed a delta function centered at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). This is because the exponential function essentially encodes the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in its oscillation, and the Fourier transform directly captures this frequency component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → z(t) → F(ω); ω → z(t) → F(ω); F(ω) → δ-function centered at ω; ω → δ-function centered at ω"
