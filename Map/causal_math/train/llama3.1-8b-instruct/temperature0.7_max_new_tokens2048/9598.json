  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). The function is subjected to the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-s^2} f(s) ds \\\\). Analyze the implications of applying this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) given the output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the original form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the output of \\\\( g(f) \\\\) provides insufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The transformation involves an integral across an infinite domain, which can place fundamental limits on retrieving \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( g(f) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
