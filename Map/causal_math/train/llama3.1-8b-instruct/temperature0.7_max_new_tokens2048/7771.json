  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the function \\\\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to function \\\\(u\\\\) and investigate its implications over variable \\\\(z\\\\).\n\nIf during the analysis, another transformation \\\\(w(z) = e^{Cz}u(z)\\\\) (where \\\\(C\\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a certain point, will the final Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(z))\\\\) be independent of the transformations applied by A and C?",
  "Explanation": "Both matrices A and C through the exponential functions \\\\(e^{Az}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Cz}\\\\) will influence the end behavior of \\\\(u(z)\\\\) significantly. The Fourier transform will reflect these effects distinctly, leading to a spectrum that is shaped by both transformations and not just one or none.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
