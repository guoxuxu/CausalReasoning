  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constant coefficients A, B, C, D. An integral transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) dt\\\\) releases a transformed state over a variable S.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (\\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) were applied at earlier times, only by knowing the resultant state at T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping influence of exponential integral transformations, different combinations of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) could yield similar or even identical endpoints. This overlap, combined with the irreversible information loss during integration, obscures the exact historical sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
