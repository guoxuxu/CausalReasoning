  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) if \\\\( k \\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "The equation involves the diffusion operator \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\), which can cause multiple initial conditions to evolve into similar states at a later time due to the smoothening effect of diffusion. Therefore, it is impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without additional constraints or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
