  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t): \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) described by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex scalar. Consider an intervention operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex scalar.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z'(t) = iAz(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the function value \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equal to the evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) directly to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) at t=0 changes the initial conditions. Although both A and B are complex scalars, they introduce phase rotations which accumulate differently over time, leading to a different complex function value at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
