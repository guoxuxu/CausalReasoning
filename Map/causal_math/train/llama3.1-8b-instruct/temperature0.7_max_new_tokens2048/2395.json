  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nIf a new operation, such as another transformation \\\\( G(z)(t) = \\int z(t)e^{i\\omega't} dt \\\\) (where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is another frequency), is implemented as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) be dependent only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new operation \\\\( G(z)(t) \\\\) acts as an intervention by superimposing or adding effects from another frequency domain, represented by \\\\( \\omega' \\). Thus, the result of the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) \\\\) can be modified by this intervention, making the final output dependent on both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
