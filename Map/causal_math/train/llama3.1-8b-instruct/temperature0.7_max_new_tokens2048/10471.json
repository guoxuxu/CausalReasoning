  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect over a region in the complex plane. Let \\\\( z \\\\) undergo a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and analyze the transformation of the region under this function.\n\nIf at a certain point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint transformation be solely dependent on the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without the influence of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new dynamic into the transformation of \\\\( z \\\\). The final state after applying \\\\( h(f(g(z_0))) \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) but also significantly on \\\\( h(z) \\\\), as the exponential function changes the nature and properties of the transformation, especially in terms of its modulus and argument in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
