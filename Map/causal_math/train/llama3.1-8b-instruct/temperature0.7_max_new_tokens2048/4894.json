  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We assess the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), applied to a function \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nGiven the transformation result \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( z \\\\), can the original power \\\\( k \\\\) of \\\\( f(t) = t^k \\\\) be inferred without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function from the integral transformation is \\\\( \\\\Gamma(k+1) z^{-(k+1)} \\\\). From the exponent of \\\\( z \\\\), one can deduce \\\\( k \\\\) as it is related by \\\\( k+1 \\\\) to the exponent. Knowledge of the Gamma function further affirms this relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
