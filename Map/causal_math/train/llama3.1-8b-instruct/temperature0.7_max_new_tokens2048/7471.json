  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a periodic signal in the complex plane. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F \\), which converts it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nIf during the interval of transformation, a modulation by \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is another constant) is introduced, will the dominant frequency component of the Fourier transform still be at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( e^{i\\beta t} \\\\) acts as an additional periodic modulation, shifting the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) by \\\\( \\beta \\\\) due to the properties of frequency modulation in Fourier analysis, resulting in a dominant component at \\\\( \\omega + \\beta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
