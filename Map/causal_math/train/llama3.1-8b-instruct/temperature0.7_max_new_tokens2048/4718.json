  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation representing the rate of change in the electrical potential V across a capacitor in an RC circuit, given by \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V \\\\). A step function intervention via a voltage source modifies the potential by adding a function \\\\( h(t) = He^{Dt} \\\\), where H, D are constants and t is time.\n\nCan the original capacitor potential \\\\( V_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from observing the potential \\\\( V(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowledge of whether the voltage source intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the intervention, one cannot distinguish whether the observed potential at T originated from natural decay of \\\\( V_0 \\\\) or was affected by \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The lack of intervention specifics precludes a unique backtrack to \\\\( V_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
