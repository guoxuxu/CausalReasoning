  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention changes the constant \\\\( a \\\\) to a different constant \\\\( b \\\\) at a certain time during the observation of \\\\( F(a)(x) \\\\), will this result in the same output of the Fourier transform for \\\\( t \\\\) beyond the intervention point?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that changes \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( b \\\\) alters the function from \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-bt} \\\\), subsequently affecting the Fourier transform outcome to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{b + ix} \\\\). Therefore, the transformation output will differ due to the change in the parameter governing \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
