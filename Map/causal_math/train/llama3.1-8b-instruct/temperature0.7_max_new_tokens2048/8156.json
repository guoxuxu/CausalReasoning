  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where the current in a circuit is modified through a signal processing function, described by \\\\( I'(t) = L(I(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator characterizing an integral transformation. Here, \\\\( I(t) \\\\) represents the original current signal over time, and we analyze the effects of this transformation over the performance of the circuit.\n\nCan we determine precisely what transformations (\\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) were applied prior to obtaining the final signal \\\\( I'(T) \\\\), based only on observing the output at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities and potential overlaps in the effects of different linear transformations, it is not feasible to definitively determine the history of interventions solely based on the signal at a single time point T. Identical output signals could arise from various combinations of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "I(t) → I'(t); L → I'(t); M → I'(T); I'(T) → I(t) is not a direct causal link as I(t) is the original input, not the output of L; I'(t) → I'(T)"
