  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by the stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) driven by the differential equation \\\\( dX = AX dt + BdW \\\\), where \\\\( W(t) \\\\) is a standard Brownian motion and A, B are matrices. Let's analyze the influence of a deterministic control policy \\\\( u(t) = Ce^{Dt}X(t) \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices integrated over a time interval.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at time T, can it be determined whether the policy \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was applied at any time on the interval or not by just observing \\\\( X(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of the deterministic matrices A, C, D and the stochastic term \\\\( BdW \\\\), multiple trajectories could result in the same final state. Hence, detecting specific interventions from the final state alone is not feasible due to the combination of deterministic and stochastic influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The control policy u(t) influences X(T), and A, B, D, and W(t) also directly affect X(T), making it impossible to determine whether u(t) was applied by just observing X(T) as its influence is intertwined with the other factors."
