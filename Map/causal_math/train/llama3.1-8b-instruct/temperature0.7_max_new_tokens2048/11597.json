  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system controlled by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Lz(t) + K \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\), where L and K are constant matrices. We examine the influence of the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Lz(t) + K \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the original system?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), which directly influences the trajectory of the system. The integral term and the matrix L will process these altered initial conditions differently, leading to a state at T that differs from the unaltered trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
