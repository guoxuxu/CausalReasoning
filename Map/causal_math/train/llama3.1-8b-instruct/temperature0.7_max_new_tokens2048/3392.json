  "Problem": "Analyzing a time-dependent quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian of the system. We explore the scenario where an operation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), with \\\\( H' \\\\) being another Hamiltonian, is applied to the system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which operations were used (whether \\\\( U(t) \\\\), \\\\( V(t) \\\\), or both) solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations and timings of applying \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) due to the superposition principle and the unitary nature of quantum mechanics. These factors make it impossible to uniquely identify the operations solely from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
