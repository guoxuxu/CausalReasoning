  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a time-dependent signal in the complex plane where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. This scenario analyzes the impact of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\\\), applied to this function and its influence over frequency domain representation.\n\nDoes applying the Fourier Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention change its frequency domain representation to only have a component at the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This transformation precisely captures the frequency content at \\\\( \\omega \\\\) with no alteration to other frequencies, thus having a component solely at \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
