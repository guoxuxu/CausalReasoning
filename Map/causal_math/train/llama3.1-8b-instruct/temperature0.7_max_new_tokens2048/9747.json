  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We analyze how transformations by the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, affect the solution over time.\n\nIf during the evolution, at some specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\{z\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{-qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), with a different complex constant \\\\( q \\\\), is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\{z\\\\} \\\\) introduces a new integral effect, which along with the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z\\\\}, alters the subsequent evolution of the function. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both transformations and cannot be considered independent of either.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
