  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic study involving a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where A is a complex constant, applied to a complex variable z. We define a transformation using the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) on this function and analyze various cases of causal inference.\n\nIf the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is known, can we unambiguously determine whether adjustments in z (e.g., additional on top of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or modifications like \\\\( z + B \\\\)) were made, solely based on the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformations like \\\\( e^{AB} \\\\) could potentially mimic or offset changes due to the original function, determining precise interventions or their sequences cannot be unambiguously concluded from the final state alone, owing to the overlapping effects of exponential transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → z; z → f(z); f(z) → y(T); y(T) → adjustments in z"
