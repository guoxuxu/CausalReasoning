  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) in a function space. We apply a Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(k) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x)) \\\\) in the frequency domain. The change in the system over time t is analyzed by applying the operator to \\\\( U(k) \\\\) exponentiated by a complex function, specifically \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega = ck \\\\) and c is a constant.\n\nCan we precisely recover the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from its frequency-domain representation \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing the initial transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the original application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and the time-dependent modification by \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t) \\\\), inversion to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) may not be accurate. The changes induced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in frequency domain complicate direct recovery of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without prior knowledge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
