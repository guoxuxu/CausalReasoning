  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) known as the Laplace Transform, on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex number.\n\nIf an additional analytic continuation is applied as an intervention to the transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) for extending its definition beyond the region \\\\( Re(s) > Re(A) \\\\), will the extended transform still reliably represent the behavior of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) for all complex s?",
  "Explanation": "While analytic continuation can extend the domain of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\), it does not ensure that the extended function behaves consistently with \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) across all complex s, especially in regions where the original integral does not converge. Such extensions might introduce behaviors not present in the original function, depending on the nature of singularities and the extended domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
