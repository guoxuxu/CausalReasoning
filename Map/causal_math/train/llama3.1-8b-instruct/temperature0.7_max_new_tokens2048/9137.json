  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{x} e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the effects of differentiating this function and the application of an operation \\\\( T(z) = z' \\\\), where \\\\( z' \\\\) denotes the derivative of z.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( z'(x) \\\\), and then if we allow \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) to evolve naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( z'(x) \\\\) at any point x depend only on the initial integral definition of z?",
  "Explanation": "The derivative operation \\\\( T \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\) will naturally yield \\\\( z'(x) = e^{x^2} \\\\). This transformation does not alter with time or x beyond this formula, and hence, the result at any point x solely depends on the function's original definition through the integral.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
