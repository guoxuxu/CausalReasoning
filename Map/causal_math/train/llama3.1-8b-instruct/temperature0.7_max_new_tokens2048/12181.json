  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely after observing the transform at any time t without knowing additional specifics of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "As the integral transform obscures some details of the original function particularly phase information and since multiple different functions can have the same transform under T, it is not possible to uniquely infer \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
