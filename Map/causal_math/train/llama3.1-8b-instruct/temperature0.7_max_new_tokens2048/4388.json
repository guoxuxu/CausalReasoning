  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), and A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\), on this system.\n\nGiven the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (whether Laplace transform, \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both) were used, solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions applied during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is challenging if not impossible by only observing the endpoint at \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple intervention sequences can lead to the same or indistinguishable final states due to the overlapping effects in the complex plane and the nonlinearities introduced by transformations like \\\\( G(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
