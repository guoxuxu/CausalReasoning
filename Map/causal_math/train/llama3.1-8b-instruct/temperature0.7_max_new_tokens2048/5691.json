  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) representing a solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at different times \\\\( t \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a differential operator \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t_1) \\\\) as an intervention and then \\\\( u \\\\) is evolved to time T, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) reflect only the effects of \\\\( L \\\\) and not \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the operator \\\\( M \\\\) directly alters the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), contributing to a divergent path in the evolution of \\\\( u \\\\). This transformation would manifest distinctly in \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), representing the cumulative effects of both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
