  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nCan we determine whether the original function or the modified function (after intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) generated a given transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), solely by examining the poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The poles of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) directly represent the frequency components embedded within the function. If \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\\\omega + k)} \\\\) is found, it indicates the presence of the intervened frequency \\\\( \\\\omega + k \\\\). Conversely, a pole at \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) suggests that the original function was unchanged. Thus, by analyzing the poles, we can determine the source frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
