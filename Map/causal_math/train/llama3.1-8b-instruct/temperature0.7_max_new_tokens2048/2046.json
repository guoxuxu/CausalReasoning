  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a Hermitian matrix and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is a fixed complex vector. The transformation evolves a quantum state in time t in a closed system.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x_0 \\\\) at time T, can one uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) assuming no knowledge of interventions but knowing A and T?",
  "Explanation": "The reversibility of unitary evolution allows for the unique determination of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by applying the inverse transformation \\\\( e^{-iAT} \\\\), since the evolution operator is both reversible and preserves all vector norms and angles due to its unitary nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
