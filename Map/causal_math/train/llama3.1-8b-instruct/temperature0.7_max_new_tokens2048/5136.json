  "Problem": "Assess the relations within a system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. We explore interventions and transformations mediated through the function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nUnderstanding the system’s end state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to clearly determine the specific interventions that were applied (i.e., \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) by just examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the possible applications of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( k(x) \\\\), multiple sequences or types of transformations could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The interactions between these matrix operations add layers of complexity that obfuscate the ability to determine the exact sequence or type of interventions just from observing the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
