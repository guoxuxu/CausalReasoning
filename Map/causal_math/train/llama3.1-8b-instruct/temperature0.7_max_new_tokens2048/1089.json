  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) with a thermal diffusivity constant k. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied as a functional alteration, impacting the system's response to thermal inputs.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is initially applied to an initial heat distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\), and the system is then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further manipulation, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) be the same as if the initial distribution was unaltered and evolved under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier Transform alters the initial conditions by transforming the thermal distribution into frequency space. This transformation changes the basis in which the heat equation operates, ultimately affecting the evolution and resulting in a different temperature distribution at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
