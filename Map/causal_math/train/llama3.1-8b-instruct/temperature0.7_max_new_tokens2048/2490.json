  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nGiven the observation of the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) knowing the matrix M but not knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The uncertainty about the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and the stochastic influence of \\\\( N \\\\, dW \\\\) make it impossible to definitively trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without specific information about the initial transformation and the random effects of \\\\( dW \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
