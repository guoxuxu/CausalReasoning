  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) governing the displacement \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of a string, where \\\\(c\\\\) is the wave speed. To analyze this system, we consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\), transforming the equation into a simpler form.\n\nIf the initial conditions are given as \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(u_t(x, 0) = g(x)\\\\), and the system is allowed to evolve without further transformation, will the solution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at any time \\\\(t\\\\) necessarily satisfy the transformed equation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}_{tt}(\\\\kappa, t) = -c^2 \\\\kappa^2 \\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform linearly turns the wave equation into an ordinary differential equation in time for each mode \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\). Since transformations here do not alter the differential characteristics imposed by the initial conditions, the solution will satisfy the equation consistently across all transformed modes.",
