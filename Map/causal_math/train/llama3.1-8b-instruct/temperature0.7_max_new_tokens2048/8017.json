  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is also a constant matrix. The transformation occurs over time t concerning an initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by multiplying it by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). Unless D is a zero matrix or commutes perfectly with C, the resulting dynamics from the altered initial condition will lead to a different state at time T, affecting how the system evolves from its initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
