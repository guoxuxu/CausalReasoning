  "Problem": "Examine the action of a Laplace transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) in relation to a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y = g(t) \\\\). Here, we investigate if transformations such as multiplying by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) will affect causal inferences about the system's evolution.\n\nIf the system at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is altered by applying an impulsive force, will the effect at time \\\\( t_2 > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without any influence of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention, such as an impulsive input, alters the system's state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and thus affects the subsequent evolution of \\\\( y(t) \\\\). This modified trajectory incorporates the effects of both the original input \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the intervention, leading to a nontrivial mixture of influences that cannot be segregated in later behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "g(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → system's evolution; t → t1; t1 → t2; impulsive force → system's evolution; system's evolution → effect at t2",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
