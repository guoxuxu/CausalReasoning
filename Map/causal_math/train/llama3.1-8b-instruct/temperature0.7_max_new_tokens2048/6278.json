  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The system's behavior is modified by applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), it is challenging to trace back the initial state accurately because the transformation \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\) could have changed the initial conditions in a non-reversible way, mainly if \\\\( F \\\\) does not commute with \\\\( C \\\\) or interact trivially with \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
