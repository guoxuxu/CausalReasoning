  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant complex number. Consider the Beta transformation defined as \\\\( h(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the exact original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an ambiguity in retracing the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, the multiplication by \\\\( e^{QT} \\\\) can significantly alter the initial condition in such a way that it becomes non-recoverable simply by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
