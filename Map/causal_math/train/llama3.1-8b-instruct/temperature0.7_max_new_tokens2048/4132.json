  "Problem": "Assess the impact of applying a matrix transformation defined as \\\\( g(x) = P^{-1}APx \\\\) to a vector spacetransformed using the base vector change matrix \\\\( P \\\\), and then evolving this system under a linear transformation \\\\( x' = Bx \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and represent different transformations.\n\nGiven the system's state at time \\\\( T \\\\), can it be determined what specific interventions occurred (specifically if transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) or change in evolution to \\\\( x' = Dx \\\\) were applied), solely based on examining \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may potentially match states achievable through various combinations and sequences of the transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and changes in evolution rules (to \\\\( Dx \\\\)). This overlap in possible state trajectories and effects due to non-commutative operations of matrices and basis changes makes it unfeasible to definitively delineate which interventions were precisely employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
