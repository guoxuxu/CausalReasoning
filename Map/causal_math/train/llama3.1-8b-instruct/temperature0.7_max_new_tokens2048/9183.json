  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\), where A is a 2x2 constant matrix. Observe the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\), where P is a constant invertible 2x2 matrix, and its effects on the solutions.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(h(x) = Qx\\\\), where Q is another constant invertible matrix, is applied as an intervention at some intermediate time t_1, will the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the matrix A and not on P or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(x)\\\\) adds another layer of complexity, modifying the system's state with \\\\(Qx(t_1)\\\\). Accordingly, the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) is determined by A, P, and Q due to their combined effects influencing the trajectory from these modified initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
