  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real frequency. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), or their temporal application, could lead to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the overlapping effects and the scalar multiplication inherent in the exponential functions. The ambiguity in transformations prohibits a unique identification of interventions solely based on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
