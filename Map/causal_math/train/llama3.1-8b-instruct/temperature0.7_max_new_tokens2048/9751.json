  "Problem": "Analyze the response of a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) to the system state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and study the progression over time t.\n\nIf a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting system's state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on L and not on the Fourier transform applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the Laplace transform introduces a complex integral manipulation specific to the time domain, making the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent not just on L but also on the earlier Fourier transformation. Since each transform affects different aspects of the function (frequency domain versus exponential decay), the endpoint will reflect composite influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
