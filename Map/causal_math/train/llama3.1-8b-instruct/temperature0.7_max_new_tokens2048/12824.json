  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then allowed to naturally progress under the mapping \\\\( z(t) = f(tz_0) \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state at time T, represented as \\\\( z(T) = f(Tz_0) \\\\), remain unchanged by the choice of the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) inherently depends on the matrix A, which governs the exponential operator. Any change in A will alter the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), which will evolve following the dynamics introduced by A, leading to different outputs depending on A's values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
