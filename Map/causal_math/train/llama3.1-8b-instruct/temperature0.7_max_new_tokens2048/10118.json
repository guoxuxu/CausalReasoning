  "Problem": "Investigate a unitary transformation system defined by \\\\(z(t+1) = Uz(t)\\\\) where \\\\(U\\\\) is a unitary matrix and \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is a complex vector. Consider the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Vz\\\\), where \\\\(V\\\\) is another unitary matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\(V\\\\), it’s impossible to uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) just from \\\\(z(t)\\\\). The potential application of \\\\(V\\\\) could have modified \\\\(z_0\\\\), and because both \\\\(U\\\\) and \\\\(V\\\\) are unitary, they preserve the norm but change other properties, impeding the exact trace back to \\\\(z_0\\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
