  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) where A, B, C, and D are constants. We examine the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, on the solution of the system over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say a Fourier transform, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on the original constants A, B, C, and D, and not on the nature of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform can modify the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), potentially altering its behavior and interactions. Hence, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend both on the original differential equation and the nature of the Fourier transform, reflecting changes in the system's spectral characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
