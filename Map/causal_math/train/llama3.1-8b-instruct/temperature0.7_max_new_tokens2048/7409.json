  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) which is a mapping from the complex plane to itself, given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The time evolution of a system is initially influenced by the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\), then governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\), where c is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by applying a complex exponential factor, which affects the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This causes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve differently from an unmodified initial condition under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = cz \\\\), resulting in a different endpoint at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
