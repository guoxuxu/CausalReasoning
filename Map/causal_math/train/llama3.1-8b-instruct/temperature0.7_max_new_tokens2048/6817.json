  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\) without intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x,T)) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) was evolved to T under the transformed system \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\mathcal{F}(L(u)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operator, and the evolution under the transformed system effectively corresponds to applying the operator to the evolutionary dynamics described by \\\\( L \\\\). Transforming first and then applying \\\\( L \\\\) results in the same outcome as applying \\\\( L \\\\) first and then transforming.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
