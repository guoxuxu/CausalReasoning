  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a two-dimensional domain, and a transformation \\\\( u(x, y) = v(x, y) + g(x, y) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) is a harmonic function (also satisfying the Laplace equation).\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) after an intervention at \\\\( (x_1, y_1) \\\\), can we precisely determine which harmonic function was added or altered (\\\\( g(x, y) \\\\) to \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\)), solely based on the observation of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining precisely which harmonic function was used or how it was altered is complex without additional information. Multiple harmonic functions could result in the same overall effect observed in the new state of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\), due to the properties of solutions to the Laplace equation and the potential for multiple harmonic functions to produce the same modifications on \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
