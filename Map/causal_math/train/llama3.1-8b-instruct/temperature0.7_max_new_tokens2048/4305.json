  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. We analyze the system under a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any modifications is transformed by the Fourier transform, then back-transformed with the inverse Fourier transform, will the resulting function at t equal to the original function at t?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse formulate a perfect reconstruction pair under ideal mathematical conditions. Transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( F \\\\) and then applying the inverse will recover the original function without loss or alteration, provided the function meets the necessary conditions for the Fourier transform properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
