  "Problem": "In a control system, the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear system \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. A transformation is applied defined by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new control input \\\\( v(t) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on F or the nature of \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new control input \\\\( v(t) \\\\) as an intervention will alter the system's path, making the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( D \\\\) but also on \\\\( F \\\\) (owing to its influence on the initial transformation) and the specifics of \\\\( v(t) \\\\). The system’s final state is consequently influenced by all these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
