  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform at time T > \\\\pi/2 shows a peak at -1, can we conclude definitely that the intervention occurred exactly at \\\\( t = \\\\pi/2 \\\\) and changed the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform showing a peak at -1 indicates that the function traced a negative frequency, it does not provide information about the exact time of intervention. The intervention could have occurred at any time before T, and exactly what modifications were made (like a phase shift or frequency inversion) would not be explicitly clear from the transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T > π/2 → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → peak at -1; peak at -1 → intervention; intervention → z(t) = e^{-it}"
