  "Problem": "Consider the interaction between two functions defined over scalar fields, \\\\( u(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( v(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where a and b are constants, in the context of an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left( h(z) \\\\right) = \\\\int_0^z u(\\\\tau) v(z - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at any \\\\( z > 0 \\\\), can we uniquely determine the constants a and b without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining a and b from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alone is not feasible due to the inherent mathematical properties of convolution; multiple combinations of a and b can yield indistinguishable results in \\\\( h(z) \\\\), particularly without knowing the specific forms or relations of u and v.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
