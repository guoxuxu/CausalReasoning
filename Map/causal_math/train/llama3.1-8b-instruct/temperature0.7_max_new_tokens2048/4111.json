  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Byt \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Dxt^2 \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We analyze the system's behavior with respect to an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\) applied at an initial time 0.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the behavior described by the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) substantially changes the system's evolution by squaring the state, which will not only affect immediate states but also has a compounding future impact. This alteration deviates the trajectory from what is predicted solely by the original differential equations, thus making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent also on the intervening function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
