  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) interacts with this dynamic over time.\n\nIf a transformation by multiplying with another function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-i\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention at some point, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at T > t1 (after intervention) reflect changes due to both the original \\\\( z \\\\) and the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by introducing a new frequency component, shifting the entire spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). This shift affects the Fourier transform resulting in a different output encompassing both the effects of the original system dynamics and the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
