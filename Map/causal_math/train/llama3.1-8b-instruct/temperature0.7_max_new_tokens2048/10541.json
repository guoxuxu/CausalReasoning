  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), where X and Y are complex constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of applying Fourier transformation on this signal and then modifying its spectrum by a filter function \\\\(H(\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is calculated and then directly inverse Fourier transformed without modifying the spectrum, will the reconstructed signal \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be the same as the original \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are inverses of each other. Thus, applying the Fourier transform followed directly by its inverse without altering the spectrum will reconstruct the original signal exactly, assuming ideal conditions and no information loss.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transformation → Spectrum; Filter function H(ω) → Modified Spectrum; Inverse Fourier transformation → Reconstructed signal z'(t); Spectrum → z'(t); Fourier transformation → z(t); X and Y → z(t)"
