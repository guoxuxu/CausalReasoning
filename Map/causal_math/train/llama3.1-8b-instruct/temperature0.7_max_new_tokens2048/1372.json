  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\) be a transfer function of a linear time-invariant system, where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. Suppose an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) through this system. We examine the effect of input transformations using a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse on the resulting output.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\), can we precisely identify which transfer function, original or altered, processed the input just from \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional data about when the function changed or details about the transitions, it's impossible to determine from \\\\( y(T) \\\\) alone whether the output was processed entirely under the original transfer function, the altered one, or a combination of both. The overall system response to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could be influenced by varying dynamics due to the change in system parameters at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
