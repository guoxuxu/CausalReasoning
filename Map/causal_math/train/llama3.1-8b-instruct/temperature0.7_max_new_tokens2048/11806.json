  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \\\\). We study the effect of transformations \\\\( g(x, y) = (x + 1, y + 1) \\\\) and their inverse on the function, along with an external forcive change in variable using the transformation \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention transforming variables with \\\\( h(x, y) = (2x, 3y) \\\\) is applied at some point after \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\), will the final value of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) depend only on the original variables \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) fundamentally alters the input to \\\\( f \\\\) further, and the final value of \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\) will depend on the intermediate transformed values through \\\\( g \\\\), as well as the final transformation through \\\\( h \\\\). This results in a dependency both on the original and the intermediate variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
