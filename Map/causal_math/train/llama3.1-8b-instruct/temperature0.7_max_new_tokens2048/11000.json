  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the wave equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Investigate the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we identify definitively the interventions (application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\)) used during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions solely from the final wave profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) is challenging, as different sequences and types of Fourier transformations could yield similar profiles, especially given the transformations' ability to modify amplitude and phase relations non-uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
