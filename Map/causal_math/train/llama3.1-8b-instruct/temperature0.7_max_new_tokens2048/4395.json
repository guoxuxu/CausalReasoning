  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), on the evolution of the system over time.\n\nIf at time t = t1, a transformation \\\\(x(t) = Mx(t)\\\\), where M is another linear operator, is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t1 be exclusively determined by the operator L and not influenced by the Fourier transform or M?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator M introduces additional dynamics to the system, and the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(x_0)\\\\) also influences the system's state. Hence, the end state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) would be dependent on L, M, and the initial application of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
