  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, and governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dt} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dv}{dt} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because transformations by exponential functions of matrices (like those in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) do not necessarily commute, and due to their being multiple ways to achieve the same final state through different sequences and combinations of interventions, it is not feasible to uniquely determine the interventions used from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
