  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a user-controlled input and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a fixed angular frequency. The evolution of the system is studied through the application of the Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven a specific transformed value \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T, can we determine what adjustments were made to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) during the interval [0, T], assuming we are aware of the basic system form but not the specifics of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple adjustments of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to various functions over [0, T] combined with the exponential component could yield the same \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely deduce the interventions made on \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from the information at time T alone, as several scenarios might fit the resulting transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
