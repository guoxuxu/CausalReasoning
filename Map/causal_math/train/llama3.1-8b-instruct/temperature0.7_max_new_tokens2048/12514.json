  "Problem": "Consider the process of solving a system of linear equations encoded by matrix operations. Let \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) represent the system with matrix A and vector b. Consider the impact of pre-multiplying both sides by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) (where M is an invertible matrix).\n\nIf during the solving of \\\\( M(Ax) = Mb \\\\), an additional operation \\\\( N(Ax) = Nb \\\\) (where N is another invertible matrix) is applied at a certain time, will the solution to \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) remain ultimately unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Similar to the application of M, the additional application of N as a transformation also does not change the eventual solution of \\\\( Ax = b \\\\). The matrix operations are reversible, and thus applying N, just like M, can be inverted to retrieve the original system without altering the solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
