  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) through different linear transformations \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The function represents a rotational motion in the complex plane, and we consider the effect of transformations on this motion.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) following an unknown transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), can we determine the exact initial state at t = 0 before any transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific parameters of \\\\( T(z) = Az + b \\\\), backtracking to the exact initial state before the transformation is impossible. Parameter \\\\( A \\\\) and the added constant \\\\( b \\\\) create ambiguities in mapping the final state back to its precise original.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
