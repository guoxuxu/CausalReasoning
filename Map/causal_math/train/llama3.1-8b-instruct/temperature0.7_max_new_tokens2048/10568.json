  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the set of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\). The impact of applying the integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is analyzed over the interval [0, T]. A, B, C, and D are constant matrices.\n\nBased on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( F(z) \\\\) or \\\\( G(z) \\\\) or both) were applied during the interval [0, T], knowing only the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the compounded effects of the integral transformations and the non-linearity introduced by multiple matrix exponentials, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely encode information of the specific transformations applied. Different combinations could yield the same final state, obscuring the intervention specifics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
