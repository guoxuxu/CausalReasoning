  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) as T approaches infinity, without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine whether the observed magnitude and phase changes of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) are solely due to the exponential operation by \\\\( k \\\\) or natural evolution under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). Different combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might yield similar endpoints, especially as T approaches infinity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
