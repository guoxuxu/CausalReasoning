  "Problem": "Assume a system where the Laplacian operator \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) governing heat distribution in a two-dimensional plane. Consider further if the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int u(x,y) e^{-x^2-y^2} dx dy \\\\) is applied to evaluate system behavior over time.\n\nIf an intervention is made by applying a new kernel transformation \\\\( G \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int u(x,y) e^{-ax^2-by^2} dx dy \\\\) (where a and b are constants) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the evaluation of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) be independent of the original transformation kernel?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G \\\\) modifies the weight and interpretation of the function \\\\( u(x,y) \\\\) across different regions of the spatial domain. This alteration impacts how \\\\( u \\\\) evolves from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T under the heat equation, ultimately affecting the resultant calculation of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T. Hence, the final value depends on both the original and the intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
