  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H \\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. We examine the effect of a unitary transformation \\\\(U(t) = e^{-i At}\\\\) on the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a Hermitian operator.\n\nIf during the evolution, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new unitary function \\\\( V(t) = e^{-i Bt} \\\\) (where \\\\(B\\\\) is another Hermitian operator) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(H\\\\) and not on \\\\(A\\\\) or \\\\(B\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( V(t) \\\\) changes the evolution of the wave function substantially by adding another layer of unitary transformation. The resulting state at time T will depend not only on the original Hamiltonian \\\\(H\\\\) but also significantly on both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The contributions of \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) interplay through the combined effect of the unitary operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
