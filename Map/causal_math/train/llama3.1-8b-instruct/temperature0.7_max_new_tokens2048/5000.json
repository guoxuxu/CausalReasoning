  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\), where K is a matrix. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\), where L is a diagonal matrix and S is an invertible matrix, over the time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both), solely based on the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to potential overlaps in the effects of \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Lt}S \\\\) and \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Mt}S \\\\) and the compound impacts these transformations can have, it is not possible to uniquely resolve the specific interventions applied leading up to \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The interactions between the transformations make it difficult to trace back precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
