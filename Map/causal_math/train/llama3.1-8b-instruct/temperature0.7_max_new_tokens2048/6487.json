  "Problem": "Consider a thermal system where the temperature distribution over a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal conductivity. Study the effect of a Fourier Transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty u(x,t) e^{-i\\\\omega x} dx \\\\) applied to the temperature distribution, especially when analyzing the system's response to external heat sources.\n\nIf we modify the thermal conductivity k to a new value k' at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, does the transformed endpoint \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) solely depend on the original conductivity k?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the thermal conductivity alters the fundamental nature of the heat diffusion. These changes will influence the rate at which heat distributes itself over the rod, and hence, the Fourier Transform of the new temperature distribution at any time T > t_1 can no longer rely solely on the original conductivity parameter k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
