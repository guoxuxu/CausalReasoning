  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the heat distribution over a rod with length L is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where u is the temperature function, k is the thermal diffusion coefficient, and subscript denotes partial derivatives. The Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}\\)) is used to analyze conditions and interventions on the temperature profile.\n\nGiven that we know the temperature distribution at T, can we definitively determine what interventions (either Fourier transform or decay filter or both) were applied during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The observed distribution at time T could result from various combinations of transformations and interventions due to the diffusive nature of heat and the varying influence of decay parameters and transformations. Consequently, without additional information, it's impossible to conclusively determine the specific sequence or types of interventions applied initially or during the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
