  "Problem": "Examine a control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx + Nu \\\\), with M and N as constant matrices representing the system dynamics and control input respectively. We consider the role of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = k^Tx \\\\) applied at different times, where k is a constant matrix and T denotes the transpose.\n\nAfter reaching state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can it be definitively determined what transformation (\\\\( h(x) \\\\)) or control inputs (\\\\( u = v \\\\)) were used, solely based on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially be achieved through different transformations and varying control inputs, given the overlapping effects and the non-exclusive influence of M and N on the state trajectory. This indeterminacy means interventions cannot conclusively be inferred just from \\\\( x(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
