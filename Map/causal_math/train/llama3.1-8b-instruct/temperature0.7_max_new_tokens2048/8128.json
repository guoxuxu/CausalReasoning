  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time is described by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(u) = u + c\\\\) where c is a constant offset applied to the temperature distribution.\n\nKnowing only the temperature distribution at time T, \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\), can the specific transformations used (\\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both) be identified, based solely on \\\\( u'(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations and changes to the initial conditions can yield similar temperature profiles at a later time due to the heat equation's dependence on diffusion and boundary conditions. Without additional information about how the interventions were applied and about the intermediate state, the specific sequence and nature of transformations cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
