  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is a scalar potential field. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) introduced at a specific location in the domain.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(\\\\phi)\\\\) is applied to the potential \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) at a point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) and allowed to propagate naturally without further intervention, will \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) at any other point in the domain remain governed solely by the Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "Appling \\\\(g(\\\\phi)\\\\) at \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) modifies the potential at that point, which implies adding a non-harmonic function \\\\(\\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\). This change violates the harmonic condition locally and can affect the potential at other points differently compared to an unaffected scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
