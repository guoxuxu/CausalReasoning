  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) encompasses dynamics given by the matrix A. We explore the influence of modifying the function through multiplication by a matrix exponential \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) where B is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final observations of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at s = 0, can we ascertain whether the modifications at any point involved B or C exclusively or which transitioned first?",
  "Explanation": "The cumulative effect on the Laplace transform at s = 0 might result from various combinations or sequences of applying B and C, due to their potential non-commutative interactions and the integrated nature of the transform. This composite influence makes it difficult to trace distinct matrix interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
