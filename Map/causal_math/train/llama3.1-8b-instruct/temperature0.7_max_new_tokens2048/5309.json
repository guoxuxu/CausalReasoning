  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output, \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is derived from the input, \\\\( x(t) \\\\), via a complex function and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bx(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential.\n\nIf the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes in a predictable manner over time without any intervention, will this result in a predictable and proportional change in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a fixed time T?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is directly affected by \\\\( x(t) \\\\) through a continuous and time-invariant transformation, any predictable change in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will induce a corresponding and computable change in \\\\( z(T) \\\\), following the characteristics of the linear transformation system. The time-invariance and linearity of the transformation ensure this proportionality.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
