  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) \\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent control function.\n\nIf the control function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 to \\\\( u'(t) = Cu(t) \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a time T be the same as if the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the control function alters the input to the integral transformation, affecting the integrand \\\\( e^{A(t-s)}BC u(s) \\\\) due to the matrix C. Since the term \\\\( BC \\\\) does not generally equal B, this results in a different trajectory and hence a different final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
