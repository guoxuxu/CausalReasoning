  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, is investigated.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition, impacting the system's evolution. The presence of \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) can alter the trajectory in ways dependent on the commutativity and other properties of matrices P and Q, leading to a different end state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
