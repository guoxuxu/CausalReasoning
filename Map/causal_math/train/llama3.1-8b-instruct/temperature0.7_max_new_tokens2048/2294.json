  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. This scenario explores how the Laplace transform impacts the behavior of the function over time.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(s) \\\\) after applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the constant \\\\( a \\\\) without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "From the form of the Laplace transform \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) can be directly determined as the pole of the function. No extra information is required since the structure of the transform clearly encapsulates the dependency on \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
