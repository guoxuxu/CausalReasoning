  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on D or also on F and G?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another variable to the dynamics of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will thus depend on the interplay and effects of F, G, and D. The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) mid-evolution suggests changes in trajectory influenced by G, making the end state dependent on all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
