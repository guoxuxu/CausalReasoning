  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent complex function \\\\( f(z, t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( Tg(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iBs}g(z) ds \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\) modifies the complex number by a factor of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), changing its initial state before undergoing transformation by T, resulting in a different outcome due to the interaction between A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
