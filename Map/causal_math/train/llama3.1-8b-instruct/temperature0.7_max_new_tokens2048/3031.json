  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a further transformation \\\\( S[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega's}f(s)ds \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\neq \\\\omega \\\\)) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome for \\\\( T[S[z]](t) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) introduces another frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) into the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since the Fourier transform of exponential functions sensitive to frequency changes, the result of \\\\( T[S[z]](t) \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), altering the overall integral transformation results significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
