  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz + Du\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, and D is the input matrix. We analyze the impact of applying a Laplace Transform to the system for an input function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Et}u_0 \\\\) where E is a constant matrix and \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and matrix E only by knowing the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) of the output z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of z(t), which includes the effects of both C and D integrating with u(t), doesn't uniquely specify \\\\( u_0 \\\\) or the matrix E. Multiple combinations of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and E might result in the same transformed output, especially due to the convolution integral's nature in the Laplace domain, leading to non-unique inverses related to the initial input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
