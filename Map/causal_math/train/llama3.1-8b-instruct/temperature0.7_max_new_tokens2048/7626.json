  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in a complex domain using a Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. This scenario investigates the implications of the reversal of this transformation and the intervention of modifying the transform function.\n\nGiven \\\\( U(s) \\\\), which was derived from an unspecified function, can we fully reconstruct the original function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without any additional data or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that the conditions for the valid application of the inverse Laplace Transform are met (including essential singularities and integration path considerations), \\\\( U(s) \\\\) will uniquely determine \\\\( u(x) \\\\) due to the bijective nature of the Laplace transformation in appropriate functional spaces.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
