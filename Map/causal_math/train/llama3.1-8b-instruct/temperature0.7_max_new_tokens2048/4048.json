  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -x + z \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = x - z \\\\). We scrutinize the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x, z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x(s) \\\\ z(s) \\\\end{bmatrix} ds \\\\) where A is a matrix given by \\\\( A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nGiven the states \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively ascertain the interventions applied (whether \\\\( h \\\\), \\\\( i \\\\), or both) by just analyzing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the inherent complexities and transformations in linear algebra and differential equations, similar end states can result from different interventions. The computation of the matrix exponentials and effects of phase space transformations may produce equivalent endpoints from different sequences of interventions. This ambiguity inhibits precise inference of specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
