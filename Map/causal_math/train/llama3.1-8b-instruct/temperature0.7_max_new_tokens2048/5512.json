  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal relationships in a complex plane system where the system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\). We examine the system's behavior under modifications through convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIs it possible to analytically determine the exact form of interventions (both the initial convolution by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and the subsequent one by \\\\( q(t) \\\\)) purely based on the modified response \\\\( H_f(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain without prior information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( H_f(s) = \\\\frac{2}{(s^3)(s-a)^2 + b(s-a) + c} \\\\), determining the sequence of convolutions and the parameters \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) exactly would require additional information not encapsulated solely in \\\\( H_f(s) \\\\). Multiple interventions and their parameters could result in equivalent forms of \\\\( H_f(s) \\\\), leading to indeterminate conclusions about the interventions’ specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
