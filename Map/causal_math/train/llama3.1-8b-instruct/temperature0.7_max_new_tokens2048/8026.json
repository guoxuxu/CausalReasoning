  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in two-dimensional space over time. We analyze how the system behaves under the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the position \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, reconstructing the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) becomes ambiguous. The transformation could have modified the phase and magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) differently based on the real and imaginary parts of A. Hence, multiple potential initial conditions might converge to the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
