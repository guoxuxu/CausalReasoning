  "Problem": "Consider a vector field expressed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. Analyze the effect when a Möbius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\) is applied to z, where a, b, c, d are complex constants.\n\nCan we determine the initial complex variable \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the Möbius transformation was applied without our knowledge, it obscures the original starting state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Since the transformation affects the state non-linearly, recovering the exact initial state without knowing the parameters a, b, c, d of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
