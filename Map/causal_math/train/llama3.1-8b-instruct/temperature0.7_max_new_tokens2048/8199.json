  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the state is evolved using a linear time-invariant differential equation described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The study will explore the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\).\n\nIf a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(x) = \\\\int e^{-st}x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time t = s, will the final state \\\\( L(x)(T) \\\\) for T > s be governed only by the dynamics under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform as an intervention introduces a transformation based on complex exponential decay which depends on the parameter s, resulting in a state that incorporates effects from both the Laplace and the original system dynamics. Thus, the final state is a product of both these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
