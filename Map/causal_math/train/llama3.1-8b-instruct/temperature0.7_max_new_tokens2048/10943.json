  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its transformation via a Fourier transform, resulting in \\\\( g(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\\\). Let's examine the effects of modifying the function in the frequency domain and then applying the inverse transformation to recover the signal in the time domain.\n\nIf an additional filtering operation (multiplication by a function \\\\( h(w) \\\\)) is applied in the frequency domain before performing the inverse Fourier transform, will the resultant time domain function remain unchanged from \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a filter \\\\( h(w) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the original function, which affects the time-domain representation of the signal after applying the inverse Fourier transform. Thus, the resultant time domain function will be an altered version of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
