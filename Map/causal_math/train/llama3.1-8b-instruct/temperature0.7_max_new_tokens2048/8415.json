  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) operating on the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant. We explore how linear transformations given by matrices affect this function through Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\), characterized as \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation matrix \\\\( A \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), altering it to \\\\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) be independent of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of matrix \\\\( A \\\\) alters the function before the Fourier Transform is applied, which affects the transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) as it now includes the effects of \\\\( A \\\\). This change is not merely a phase or scale shift, implying dependence on the characteristics of matrix \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z(t); ω → z(t); A → z(t); z(t) → Z(ω); z(t) → Fourier Transform; A → Z(ω); ω → Z(ω); Z(ω) → independence from A"
