  "Problem": "Consider a model where the temperature change in a material over time is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source is introduced via a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function representing the heat input.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we identify what specific interventions (\\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) were used throughout the process?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations or intensities of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( c(t) \\\\) could result in the same final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) due to their compensatory effects on temperature modification. The overlap in possible states from different intervention paths makes it impossible to specifically identify the applied interventions solely based on \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
