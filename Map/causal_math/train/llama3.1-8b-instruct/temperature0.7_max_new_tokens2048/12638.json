  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant. The function describes a point moving in a complex plane. We explore the relationship between linear transformations given by matrices and their effects on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), another transformation \\\\( R(z) = Bz \\\\\\) (where B is another complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, is the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) for T > t_1 solely dependent on \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\), ignoring effects of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( R(z) = Bz \\\\\\) along with the initial transformation introduces multiple factors that influence the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\). These transformations will change the amplitude, frequency, or phase, resulting in a trajectory dependent on A, B, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
