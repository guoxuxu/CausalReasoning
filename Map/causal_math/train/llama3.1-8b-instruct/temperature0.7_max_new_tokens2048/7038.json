  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z = g(x) \\\\) that maps a real variable x into the complex plane and a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lf = f'' + af' + bf \\\\), where a and b are real constants. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int e^{sx} f(x) dx \\\\), with a complex variable s, on the differentiability and behavior of this expression over time.\n\nKnowing the resulting transformation \\\\( T(Lg)(s) \\\\) for some s, can we uniquely determine the form of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without prior knowledge of whether the transformation or the operator was applied first?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the operator \\\\( L \\\\) can potentially alter the function in ways that make it ambiguous to recover \\\\( g(x) \\\\) uniquely. Integrals and derivatives might introduce or obscure features in \\\\( g(x) \\\\) based on their interaction with the parameters a, b, and s.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
