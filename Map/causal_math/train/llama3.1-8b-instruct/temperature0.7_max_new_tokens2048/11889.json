  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2tz \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\). An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2}z(s) ds \\\\) is applied over time t.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) up to time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing the intermediate values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is an integral transformation which includes the exponential term \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\), blending the effects of all values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during the interval from 0 to T. This composite effect masks the specific influence of the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), preventing its unique determination from the final result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
