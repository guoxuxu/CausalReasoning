  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the complex differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is considered.\n\nFrom the value of \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) at any time T and knowing an intervention of \\\\( U \\\\) was used, can we determine precisely what the original function was, or the precise details of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\) could potentially correspond to various different initial conditions of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or interventions due to the loss of specific information (like exact changes in phase or magnitude caused by U) during the transformation process. Precise determination of the original conditions or the details of the intervention is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
