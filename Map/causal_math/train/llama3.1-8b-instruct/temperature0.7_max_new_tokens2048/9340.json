  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the diffusion coefficient. An integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) concerning the spatial variable x.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( V(s, T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely whether an intervention happened and if so, what the value of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "Even though \\\\( V(s, T) \\\\) reflects modifications due to an intervention, multiple values of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) could lead to similar or indistinguishable transformed outcomes because of overlay in resulting trajectories in the Laplace domain. Thus, determining \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or concluding definitively about the intervention based solely on \\\\( V(s, T) \\\\) is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
