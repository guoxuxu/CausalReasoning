  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) without further intervention, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) had evolved directly under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial state by integrating the effects of the function \\\\( e^{C(t-s)} \\\\) with the system states over time, thus changing the evolution trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T will therefore differ due to this modified initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
