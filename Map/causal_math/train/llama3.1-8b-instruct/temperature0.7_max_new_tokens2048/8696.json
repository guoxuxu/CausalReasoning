  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit (Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C)) in series. The governing differential equation is \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\\\frac{q}{C} = 0\\\\), describing the charge \\\\(q\\\\) on the capacitor over time. We are interested in the effects of applying a Laplace transform to this equation, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain after an unknown intervention, can we determine what intervention occurred (type and magnitude), only from the knowledge of \\\\(Q(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace domain solution \\\\(Q(s)\\\\) doesn't provide explicit indications regarding the specifics of what interventions occurred unless initial and boundary conditions are known exactly. Multiple types of interventions might yield similar or indistinguishable changes in the Laplace domain, thereby obscuring the precise nature and magnitude of any intervention applied to the system in the time-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
