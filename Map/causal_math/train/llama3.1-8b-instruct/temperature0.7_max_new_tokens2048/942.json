  "Problem": "Let's consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) + Nu(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) represents the state vector, \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is the control input vector, M is a constant state matrix, and N is a control matrix. We assess the effect of a transformation represented as \\\\(h(x) = e^{Kt}x\\\\), where K is also a constant matrix.\n\nIs it possible to precisely trace back to the original state vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) at t = 0 after monitoring the state vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, without knowing if the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation about the initial application of \\\\(h(x)\\\\), it's indeterminate to revert precisely to \\\\(x_0\\\\) due to the influential potential of the matrix \\\\(K\\\\) on the system's evolution, which might not cleanly reverse using information provided only by M or the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation h(x) directly influences the state vector x(t), which in turn is influenced by the control input vector u(t) and the state matrix M and control matrix N."
