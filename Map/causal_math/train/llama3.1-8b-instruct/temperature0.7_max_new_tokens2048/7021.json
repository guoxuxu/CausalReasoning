  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nIf \\( f(x) \\) is applied to a state \\( x_0 \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), and the system is then evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\) for a control \\( u \\), will \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( x_0 \\) was just directly evolved under \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( f(x) \\) alters the initial state \\( x \\) to \\( Sx_0 \\), which affects the system's initial condition. The trajectory will therefore diverge from that of the unmodified system unless \\( S \\) commutes perfectly with the dynamics governed by \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) does not contribute, resulting in different trajectories and thus different states at time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
