  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The behavior is studied under the transformation \\\\( T(x, y) = (e^x, e^y) \\\\) on the complex function.\n\nGiven the final outcome of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) after interventions \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\), can we explicitly determine which transformations were used and in what sequence, strictly from knowing the final value of \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity of the transformations and their effects on the inputs \\\\( (x, y) \\\\) through exponential and logarithmic functions mean that different sequences of applying \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) or different intervention times could lead to the same final output, resulting in ambiguity about the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
