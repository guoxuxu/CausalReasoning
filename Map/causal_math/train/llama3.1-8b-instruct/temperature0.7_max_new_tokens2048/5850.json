  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ y(t) \\\\} = Y(s) \\\\) with a convolution operation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-kt} \\\\), where k is a constant. The impact of initial and intermediate alterations using the convolution operation is studied.\n\nGiven the altered Laplace Transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\cdot G(s) \\\\) at s = T, can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without acknowledging the convolution happened?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing that convolution by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) took place, retrieving the original \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the modified \\\\( Y(s) \\\\cdot G(s) \\\\) is impossible since multiple functions could yield the same product upon transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
