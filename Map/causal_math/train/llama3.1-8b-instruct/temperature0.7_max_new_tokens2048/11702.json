  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) \\\\) on the function, shaping how it evolves over time.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective (one-to-one and onto) linear transformation for functions satisfying certain growth conditions. Therefore, knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) allows for the unique reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through the inverse Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
