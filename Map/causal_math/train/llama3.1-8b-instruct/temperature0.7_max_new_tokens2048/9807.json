  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex-valued differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a real constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau}z d\\\\tau \\\\) over time t, where B is a real constant matrix that generally does not commute with A.\n\nIf, at a specified time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{iC\\\\tau}z d\\\\tau \\\\) (where C is a different constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) exclusively rely on the dynamics governed by A and not be affected by B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The additional integration \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces further complexity and results in an overall system that is influenced not only by A but also by the effects of B and C. These matrices can significantly alter the state at T through their respective transformations and do not simply superpose.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
