  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\), where U is a matrix that diagonalizes D (i.e., \\\\( UDU^{-1} = D' \\\\) is a diagonal matrix).\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\) alters the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( U^{-1}x_0 \\\\), changing the trajectory of the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\). The evolution will occur in the transformed coordinates, potentially giving a different final state when transformed back to the original coordinates.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
