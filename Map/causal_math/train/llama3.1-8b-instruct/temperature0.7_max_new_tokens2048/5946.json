  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario involving integral transformations. Let \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be a holomorphic function in a region \\\\( R \\\\). We examine the effect of transforming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\), defined by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_C K(z, s) f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in \\\\( R \\\\) and \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\) is a kernel function also holomorphic in some domain of \\\\( R \\\\).\n\nGiven a function \\\\( g(z) = T[f](z) \\\\), can we uniquely reconstruct \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the kernel \\\\( K(z, s) \\\\) and the contour \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) is generally impossible because multiple different functions \\\\( f \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( g \\\\) under different transformations, reflecting the non-invertibility or non-uniqueness of the integral transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
