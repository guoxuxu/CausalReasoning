  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function operates in a space undergoing changes described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), with A being a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention of the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t1 \\\\) during the evolution, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t1 \\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), disregarding the effects of \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) adds an additional dynamic to the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This will influence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent not just on \\\\( A \\\\), but also on the transformations introduced by \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). Such influences can alter the path and thereby the resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
