  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf an intervention is made by modifying the complex function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) before applying the integral transformation, will the result \\\\( T[g] \\\\) at parameter s still reflect only the influences from the original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), altering the behavior under the integral transform. The result \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} e^{t^2} \\\\, dt \\\\) is significantly different and now depends on the new function form \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\), showing influence from both the intervention and the original transformation mechanism.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
