  "Problem": "Consider the equation governing the heat conduction in a rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the spatial variable. Assume the rod is initially at rest with a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) and that k is a constant.\n\nIf we start with a specific initial condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and allow the system to evolve according to \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) for a time T without any external influence or adjustment to the system (like additional heat sources or sinks), will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) exactly follow the solution of the heat equation derived solely from \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution for \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is uniquely determined by the initial condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) when evolving according to the heat equation without external interference. The solution follows from the explicit form of the heat kernel applied to \\\\( h(x) \\\\), making it solely dependent on the initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
