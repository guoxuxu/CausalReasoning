  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then its Fourier transform is taken, will the resulting spectrum be the same as if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was transformed without multiplication by \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by the Gaussian \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the signal by damping it before the transform. This damping changes the frequency components leading to a different spectrum. The Gaussian acts as a frequency filter, emphasizing some components while suppressing others.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t = 0 → multiplication by g(x); multiplication by g(x) → Fourier transform of f(x); Fourier transform of f(x) → resulting spectrum; multiplication by g(x) → f(x); f(x) → Fourier transform of f(x); Fourier transform of f(x) → resulting spectrum; g(x) → a; a → Gaussian function g(x)"
