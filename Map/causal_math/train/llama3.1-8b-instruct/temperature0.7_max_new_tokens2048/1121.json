  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the impact of a Fourier transform on this function, defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is calculated for \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is reconstructed using the inverse Fourier transform, will the reconstructed function match the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at all times?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse form a pair that when applied sequentially, under ideal conditions (assuming all operations are performed correctly and all necessary conditions for the Fourier transform are met), reconstruct the original function exactly, hence \\\\( z(t) \\\\) should perfectly match its original form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
