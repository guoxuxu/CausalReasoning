  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = Vz \\\\), where V is a different constant matrix, is applied at some t=T_1<T, will the function form at T still be unaffected by the transformations U and V?",
  "Explanation": "The application of both \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\) as transformations at different times introduces new dynamics into the system. The overall trajectory and final form at time T are affected by both transformations, altering the standard quadratic nature of the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
