  "Problem": "Consider a series of kinematic equations \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t) = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\vec{a}t^2\\\\) in a physics simulation space, where \\\\(\\\\vec{a}\\\\) is the acceleration vector. Analyze how applying a transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that scales and rotates the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) affects the position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity vector \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge of the application of the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\), it is not possible to trace back to the original velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) accurately. The transformation could alter the velocity in various ways, impacting the displacement observed and thus concealing the original conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
