  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) a real number frequency parameter. The integral transform of this function with respect to time using the Laplace transform is analyzed.\n\nBased on the final Laplace transform data at T, can we precisely infer whether the damping intervention was applied and if so, identify \\\\(\\alpha\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple configurations of damping factors and original frequencies can produce overlapping effects in the Laplace transform domain, adding intrinsic ambiguity. The transformation data alone, without additional context on interventions or initial parameters, does not suffice for precise backward deduction of the damping factor's presence or value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
