  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is studied.\n\nCan we determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application or non-application of \\\\( T \\\\), reconstructing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is not feasible. The transformation could alter initial conditions significantly, hindering the accurate back-calculation from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
