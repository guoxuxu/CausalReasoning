  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a set of coupled differential equations. Analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( u(s) \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) within (0, T), the system undergoes an additional transformation \\\\( z(t_1) = z(t_1) + v(s) \\\\) where \\\\( v(s) \\\\) is another complex function, will the state \\\\( z(T1) \\\\) only depend on the natural dynamics and not on \\\\( u(s) \\\\) or \\\\( v(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( u(s) \\\\) and \\\\( v(s) \\\\) can qualitatively and quantitatively modify the state at their respective points of application. The final state \\\\( z(T1) \\\\) is contingent on these transformations along with the inherent system's dynamics, making the state at T1 a function of all these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
