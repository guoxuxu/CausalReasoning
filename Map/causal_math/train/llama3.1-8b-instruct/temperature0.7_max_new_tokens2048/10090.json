  "Problem": "Consider the inversion of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = z^2 + cz\\\\) where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. We assess the effect of the Laplace transform on the inversion process determined by the equation \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{az}g(z))(s)\\\\) where \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is another function of \\\\(z\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nFrom the given \\\\(F(s)\\\\), can we definitively reconstruct the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\) assuming no changes or transformations were applied besides \\\\(e^{az}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the Laplace transform of the integrated function implicates the presence of \\\\(e^{az}\\\\), inversion to retrieve \\\\(g(z)\\\\) without knowledge of the specific form of \\\\(a\\\\) and additional transformations requires more data. \\\\(g(z)\\\\) remains non-unique due to potential variations that yield the same transform result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
