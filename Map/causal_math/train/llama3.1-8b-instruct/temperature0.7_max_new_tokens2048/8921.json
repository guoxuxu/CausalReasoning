  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(t) =  ∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given function. We study how changes in \\\\( h(s) \\\\) influence the graph of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) given that \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is changed to \\\\( h'(s) = h(s) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, and allowed to evolve under the integral transformation without further changes, will the function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be a simple vertical shift of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( c \\\\frac{e^{st}-1}{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z'(t) = ∫_0^t e^{st} (h(s) + c) ds = ∫_0^t e^{st} h(s) ds + c∫_0^t e^{st} ds = z(t) + c \\\\frac{e^{st} - 1}{s} \\\\), the alteration of the function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) by a constant results in a vertical shift of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), following the properties of the integral of exponential functions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
