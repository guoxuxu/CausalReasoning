  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F[z] = \\\\int e^{iBt}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\) over time interval [0, T], where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( F[z] \\\\) is computed over \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) up to \\\\( t = T \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( F[z] \\\\) be identical to the function computed if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was left to evolve under its own rules without applying \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( F[z] \\\\) changes the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by blending it with \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\), which alters the result significantly compared to the plain evolution of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) without any transformation. The matrix exponentials and their interplay directly affect the integral's result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
