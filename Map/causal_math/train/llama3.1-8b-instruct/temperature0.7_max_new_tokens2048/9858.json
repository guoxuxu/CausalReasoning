  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Dy\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Evaluate the system's dynamics under different transformations and perturbations using scalar functions and the Laplace transform, represented as \\\\( f(y) = Ly \\\\) where L is a linear operator.\n\nAfter observing the system's state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( f(y) \\\\) was applied, it is challenging to determine the initial state accurately. The transformation \\\\( Ly \\\\) could alter the initial state \\u2018provided the properties of L, and without that, the original vector \\\\( y_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
