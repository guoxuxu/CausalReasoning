  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla u = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\Delta u + f\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the velocity field, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity, and \\\\(f\\\\) is an external force. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the force term \\\\(f\\\\).\n\nGiven the velocity field \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time T, can we infer whether the original force \\\\(f\\\\) or its Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(f)\\\\) was applied at t=0 without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional traceable markers or information about the initial conditions and transformations applied, it's generally impossible to reverse-engineer the velocity field \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time T to uniquely determine whether \\\\(f\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(f)\\\\) was initially applied, especially due to the complex non-linear evolution of the Navier-Stokes equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
