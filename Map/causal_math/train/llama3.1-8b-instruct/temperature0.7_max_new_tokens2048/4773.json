  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(h(z) = \\frac{1}{z}\\) in the complex plane and its transformation under the integral \\( I[h] = \\int_{\\gamma} h(z) \\, dz \\) along a contour \\( \\gamma \\). The contour \\( \\gamma \\) is relevant as it defines the effect of \\( h \\) after transformation via path integral.\n\nIf the contour \\( \\gamma \\) encloses the pole at \\( z = 0 \\), will the integral \\( I[h] \\) be the same as if \\( \\gamma \\) did not enclose any pole?",
  "Explanation": "The integral of \\(h(z)\\) over a contour enclosing a pole includes contributions from the residues at those poles. Since \\( \\gamma \\) encloses the pole at \\(z=0\\), the integral \\(I[h]\\) will include the residue at \\(z=0\\), which alters the result from when no poles are enclosed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
