  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with time evolution defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An operator transformation given by \\\\( f(y) = Cy \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix, is applied as an intervention.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations (\\\\( f(y) \\\\), \\\\( g(y) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) could result from different sequences and types of interventions, and without explicit intermediate states or additional constraints, the potential combinations of C, D, and the inherent evolution through A allow for multiple histories that can yield the same endpoint. This ambiguity prevents a precise reconstruction of the transformation sequence solely from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
