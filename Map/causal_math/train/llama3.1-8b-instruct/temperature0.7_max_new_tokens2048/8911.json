  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( g(z) = z^2 f(z) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Fourier transform of the resultant function at a later time \\\\( t \\\\) solely depend on the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of multiplying by \\\\( z^2 \\\\) introduces a significant change in the behavior and the Fourier transform of the function. This polynomial modification affects both the scale and nature of the frequency components, in addition to the factors introduced by the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
