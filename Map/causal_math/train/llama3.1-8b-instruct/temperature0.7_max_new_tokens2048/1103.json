  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Cz + D \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are matrices. This system is affected by applying an integration transform \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int z(t) dt \\\\). We assess how the system behaves with or without this transformation, and how interventions could influence results over time.\n\nIf during the system evolution at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention using another operation \\\\( j(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ks}z(s)ds \\\\) (where K is a constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( C \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( K \\\\), or the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity by integrating z along a modified exponential path influenced by K. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends on the interplay of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\), as well as how the initial conditions were set or transformed, leading to potential variations in the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
