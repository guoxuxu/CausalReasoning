  "Problem": "Consider a system given by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents an input function to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) at different time points on system behavior.\n\nIf an intervention using a transformation \\\\( k(y) = e^{Ct}y \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system output at time T (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be solely influenced by the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\), and not by \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(y) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the system's evolution. The final output at T is now influenced by the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and the effects of both transformations (\\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\)), as they may modify how the contributions of the input function \\\\( u(s) \\\\) accumulate over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
