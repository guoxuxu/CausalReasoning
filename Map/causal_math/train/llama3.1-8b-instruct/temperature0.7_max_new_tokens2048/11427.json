  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\\\) where i is the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) over time t, with k being a constant complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{mt}z \\\\) (where m is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the dynamics defined by i, and not on k or m?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a new modifying variable, m, influencing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) along with k and i. The overall trajectory becomes governed by both interventions and the underlying dynamics, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = z_0e^{it}e^{k(t_1)}e^{m(T-t_1)} \\\\), hence dependent on k, m, and i.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
