  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\), where A is a complex constant, in the context of an integral transformation. We are particularly interested in the causality analysis between transformations and original functions.\n\nCan the source term A be uniquely determined from the result of the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), given as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) without any external information?",
  "Explanation": "The form \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) distinctly maps back to \\\\( A \\\\) as the pole of the Laplace transform, uniquely identifying the original exponential term. This precise back-tracking is definitive unless there is additional convolution or manipulation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
