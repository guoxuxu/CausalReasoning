  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z = g(x) \\\\) that maps a real variable x into the complex plane and a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( Lf = f'' + af' + bf \\\\), where a and b are real constants. We examine the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int e^{sx} f(x) dx \\\\), with a complex variable s, on the differentiability and behavior of this expression over time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without further operations, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( Lg \\\\) at a specific \\\\( s \\\\) be the same as the operation \\\\( L \\\\) applied after the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T \\\\) before \\\\( L \\\\) alters how derivatives are taken due to the integral and exponential factors involved in T, which modifies the terms in \\\\( Lg \\\\). The Laplace transform of a differential operation generally does not commute with the differential operator unless specific conditions on a, b, and s are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
