  "Problem": "Let's consider a function \\( z = h(x, y) \\) given by \\( z = x^2 + y^2 \\) in a two-dimensional space. We examine the role of a Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), applied to \\( h(x, y) \\) defined by \\( H(u, v) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v) \\) and analyze its effect in the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\( h(x, y) \\) is transformed into the frequency domain by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), and the resulting function \\( H(u, v) \\) evolves under the influence of some linear operations without further intervention, will the function in the spatial domain \\( h(x, y) \\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\( h(x, y) \\) into \\( H(u, v) \\) already changes the domain from spatial to frequency, thereby fundamentally altering its representation and properties. Evolving \\( H(u, v) \\) under new conditions without reversing the transformation would not yield the original \\( h(x, y) \\) in its unchanged form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "h(x, y) → H(u, v); H(u, v) → h(x, y) through inverse Fourier transform; Fourier transform operation causes changes in H(u, v); linear operations on H(u, v) → H(u, v)"
