  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex system behavior given by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-\\\\tau)A} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input of the system.\n\nIf the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a continuous function and is applied to the system, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same irrespective of the specific structure of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends sensitively on the structure of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) because the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{(t-\\\\tau)A} \\\\) and the interaction between the matrix A and the input \\\\( x(\\\\tau) \\\\) throughout the integral transform delineate the system's output. Different matrices \\\\( A \\\\) can lead to varying impulse response characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
