  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, having a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency. This scenario explores causal inference in system responses by examining different excitation functions and their respective impacts.\n\nIf an impulse function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) is applied to the system resulting in an output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and assuming no further intervention in the system, will the output be purely the impulse response of the system \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from an impulse input \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) in a linear time-invariant system is the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), as described by the property of the Laplace Transform. The system's behavior follows directly from the definition of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Impulse function → System excitation; System excitation → Transfer function H(s); Transfer function H(s) → Impulse response h(t); Impulse response h(t) → Output y(t)"
