  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ixt}u(t)dt \\\\) on the function u over time t.\n\nCan we precisely recover the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) after observing the transformed state \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied, several different initial conditions could result in the same state at t = T due to the changes introduced by the frequency domain representation. The Fourier transform's effect on the phase and amplitude of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) obscures the original function characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
