  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are real constants and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We investigate how the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt\\\\), affects the function and the implications of different transformations.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) of the original function \\\\(z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)}\\\\) directly reveals the complex numbers \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\). The real part of the pole gives \\\\(a\\\\), and the imaginary part provides \\\\(b\\\\), allowing the unique identification of both parameters from the transformed function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
