  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by a linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Ku\\\\), where D is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics, and K is a control matrix. The input u(t) is an external control function. We examine the impact of a Laplace transform on the control signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\) and its repercussions on the system's response.\n\nFrom the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we ascertain precisely which control transformations were applied (whether \\\\( U(s) \\\\), \\\\( P(t) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the value of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of control signal transformations and interventions. The system's response to control inputs is dependent on the interplay of these transformations with the system dynamics, making it challenging to uniquely identify what specific interventions and transformations were applied based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
