  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a temperature \\( T(x,t) \\) at a point \\( x \\) in a rod and time \\( t \\) obeys the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) with thermal conductivity \\( k \\). We investigate the application of a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(x,t)) \\) to convert spatial components of the heat distribution into the frequency domain at time \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nCan we exclusively determine if the initial Fourier transform or the intervention at \\( t_1 \\) was responsible for the thermal state \\( T(x,T) \\) just by analyzing the state \\( T(x,T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity added by the Fourier transform and intermediate intervention, it is impractical to isolate effects and attribute them to specific actions. The overlay of multiple influences makes precise causal attribution from the end state alone very challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
