  "Problem": "Examine a feedback loop in an electrical circuit, modeled by a linear time-invariant system with transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q} \\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. Let us consider an alteration involving the introduction of a feedback matrix K, changing the system to \\\\( \\\\tilde{H}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sP + Q + K} \\\\).\n\nObserving the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\), is it feasible to precisely determine whether the interventions were applied in the form of feedback matrices \\\\( K \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), or both, based solely on the value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the compounded influences of multiple feedback matrices and the potential for overlapping effects on the system's dynamics, it is impracticable to distinctively ascertain which feedback interventions were employed merely from the final output. Various combinations of K and L can yield equivalent final states, complicating the reverse engineering of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing a feedback matrix K influences the transfer function H(s), which in turn affects the output y(T)."
