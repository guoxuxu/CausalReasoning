  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(s) = e^{s^2} \\\\), where s is a complex variable. We advance to analyze the system transformed by the Laplace transform with respect to s, denoted by \\\\( L \\\\{ z(s) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf the original function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform without any additional operations, is the resulting transform \\\\( L \\\\{ z(s) \\\\} \\\\) equivalent to performing any basic operation (like scaling) before applying the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a function alters its domain and behavior significantly, expressing the function in terms of a new variable that changes according to exponential decay characteristics. This change isn't something that can be mimicked merely by operations such as scaling or any other linear transformation applied before taking the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
