  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Y(s) = L\\{y(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform. The system is initially influenced by a forcing function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed version \\\\( H(s) = L\\{h(t)\\} \\\\). We investigate how different operational matrices affect the outcome given by the inverse Laplace transform if applied.\n\nCan we extract the original function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) accurately from the output after the system has been affected by the operational matrix \\\\( M(s) \\\\) and all without any information about \\\\( M(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the operational matrix \\\\( M(s) \\\\) used, it is impossible to precisely deduce \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from the output because \\\\( M(s) \\\\) could have altered the system's dynamics in various ways, potentially making the transformation non-invertible or altering the scale and the nature of the system properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
