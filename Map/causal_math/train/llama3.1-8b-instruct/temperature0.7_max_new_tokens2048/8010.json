  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nFollowing the observation of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) after evolving from the modified initial condition at t = 0, can we deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the initial distribution was modified by \\\\( g(u) = Au + h \\\\), we cannot retrieve the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\). The alteration from the linear transformation and addition of h masks the original state and its subsequent natural evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
