  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform applied to a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\), and let the transformed function be \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\). Assume the operation of convolution with another function \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the time domain, consequently leading to a multiplication by \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), in the frequency domain.\n\nIf a filter function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied after convolving \\\\(f(x)\\\\) with \\\\(g(x)\\\\) but before Fourier transformation, will the final Fourier transform product solely depend on the original \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) and not on \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a filter function adds another layer of complexity; the eventual Fourier transformed result will involve the transforms of all three functions, \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\), \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), and \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\) (the transform of \\\\(h(x)\\\\)). Therefore, the impact of \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\) on the final outcome cannot be negated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
