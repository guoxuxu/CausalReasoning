  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = C e^{Dt}\\\\), where the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) governs the dynamics of \\\\(z\\\\), and \\\\(C\\\\) is a vector of initial conditions. The system undergoes a transformation via another function \\\\(h(z) = Mz\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\(g(z) = Nz\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), where \\\\(N\\\\) is another transformation matrix, will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the matrix \\\\(D\\\\) and not on \\\\(M\\\\) or \\\\(N\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) as an intervention changes the system state to \\\\(Nz(t_1)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), and this intervention mutates the trajectory such that the final state depends on \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(N\\\\), and \\\\(D\\\\). The matrix exponentials and their sequence significantly influence the final state, making it dependent not only on \\\\(D\\\\) but also on the applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
