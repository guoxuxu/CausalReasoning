  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to investigate variations in trajectory overt time t.\n\nIf an intervention using a new transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at a certain intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the matrices A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory of the system again, making the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on A, B, and the transformation matrices C and D. The changes due to interventions can accumulate and interact in complex ways, making the trajectory dependent on all matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
