  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit containing a resistor, inductor, and capacitor (RLC circuit) where the voltage input \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is a function defined by \\\\( V(t) = A \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\), with A and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being constants. We analyze how the transformation defined by the Laplace transform affects the circuit's response over time.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{V(t)\\\\} \\\\) is applied to the voltage input at t = 0 and then the circuit is allowed to respond under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will the system's transient response \\\\( i(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as if \\\\( V(t) \\\\) was applied directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the voltage input modifies how the initial conditions are represented, altering the transient response of the circuit. The impact of initial conditions in the s-domain (Laplace transform domain) changes the evolution of the current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → ω; ω → V(t); V(t) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → i(t); V(t) → i(t); i(t) → transient response",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The frequency ω directly influences the voltage V(t), which then directly affects the Laplace transform, and this, in turn, causes the current i(t), leading to the transient response."
