  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) of the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), that changes the representation of \\\\(u\\\\) from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nCan we uniquely recover the function \\\\(u_0\\\\) from the transformed data at time \\\\(T\\\\) after applying \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and solving, without knowing the specific form of \\\\(L\\\\) or having additional boundary/initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the final state in the frequency or original domain doesn't uniquely determine \\\\(u_0\\\\) without explicit knowledge of the operator \\\\(L\\\\) and any additional conditions that could affect the solution path (e.g., boundary conditions), since multiple initial states could theoretically lead to the same final transformed state under different system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
