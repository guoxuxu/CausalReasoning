  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\(y(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}(t-s)X(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and X(s) is a time-dependent input function. We explore the impact of modifying the input via the transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( X(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under the original integral transformation without further modification, will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( X(t) \\\\) was directly integrated to t = T under the original system definition?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t) \\\\) changes the input function, thus altering the integral component of the system. The resultant \\\\( y(t) \\\\) includes the effects of both matrices A and B, leading to a different outcome at time T due to the exponential influence of B on X.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
