  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system dynamics are further influenced by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\), where \\\\( m \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf observing the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\), can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "From the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), it is impractical to determine if the initial state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^m \\\\) due to the exponential nature of both the transformation and the evolution function. Both could yield similar results under different configurations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\), complicating back-calculation to the original form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
