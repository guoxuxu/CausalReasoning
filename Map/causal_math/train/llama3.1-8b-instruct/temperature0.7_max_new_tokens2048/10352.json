  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a complex plane, influenced by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z dt \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the transformations and interventions applied (both \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\)), simply by analyzing the final state at T?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from multiple potential combinations of transformations and interventions (different parameters of Q and R), especially as each transformation nonlinearly integrates both the exponential effect and the influence of distribution paths leading to non-uniqueness in causal deduction from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
