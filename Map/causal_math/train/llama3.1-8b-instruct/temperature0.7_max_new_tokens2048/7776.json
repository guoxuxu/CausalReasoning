  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a space defined by linear operators. We have the operators \\\\( L \\\\) for differentiation and \\\\( M \\\\) for multiplication by function \\\\( t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer. We explore the impact of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this setup.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform result after applying \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\), and an unknown subsequent operation, can we deduce definitively which operation (\\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\) or another possible operation) was applied last?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform results, influenced by complex interactions of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) with any subsequent operation, do not uniquely determine what the last operation was. Different operations could produce similar transforms, making it impossible to specify without extra information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
