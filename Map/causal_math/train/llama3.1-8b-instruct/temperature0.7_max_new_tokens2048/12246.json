  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving in time under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) are real constants reflecting oscillatory and exponential behaviors, respectively.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention applies a new transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\phi}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\phi \\\\) is a real constant, will the new state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), not on \\\\( \\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a phase shift through the multiplication by \\\\( e^{i\\phi} \\\\), affecting the argument of the complex number representation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the parameter \\\\( \\phi \\\\) along with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\lambda \\\\), modifying both magnitude and orientation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
