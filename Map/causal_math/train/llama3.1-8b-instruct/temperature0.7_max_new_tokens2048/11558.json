  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = e^{i\\omega t} w \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. The system under study is defined by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\dot{w} = -iw \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation on the system evolution.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( z(w) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\) was applied, it is unclear whether the observed state at t = T has been modulated by the exponential term \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). The ambiguity in initial conditions due to this unknown transformation makes it impossible to uniquely deduce \\\\( w_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
