  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) forming an RL circuit, subjected to a voltage \\( V(t) \\) described as a sinusoidal input \\( V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The response of the circuit is analyzed by examining the current \\( I(t) \\), and we analyze the effect of a transformation \\( f(I) = e^{st}I \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention by another transformation \\( g(I) = e^{Ct}I \\), where \\( C \\) is another complex number, is applied, will the resulting current \\( I(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) be independent of \\( s \\) from \\( f(I) \\) and only dependent on the system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\( g(I) \\) adds another complex exponential factor influencing the system’s behavior, and as such, the resultant current \\( I(T) \\) will depend on both \\( s \\) and \\( C \\) and their interaction with the natural response of the RL circuit, changing the overall response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
