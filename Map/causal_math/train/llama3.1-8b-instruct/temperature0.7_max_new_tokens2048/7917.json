  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the differential equations without further intervention, will the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T differ from what it would be if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\\\\\mat{ z_0 } to \\\\\\\\bm{ e^{i\\\\omega 0}z_0 } = z_0, \\\\) but the ongoing multiplication by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) changes the trajectory. The transformation adds a rotating factor which interacts differently compared to just the linear dynamics of the original system, introducing a different frequency and phase shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
