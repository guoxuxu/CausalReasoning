  "Problem": "The behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant complex number. An operation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is considered where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex scaling factor.\n\nCan we precisely backtrack all interventions and initial conditions applied to the system only by analyzing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Deciphering the precise sequence of interventions and the original initial condition from the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible without further information. The transformations caused by the operations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and any subsequent interventions like \\\\( f(z) \\\\) lead to multiple possible histories that could yield the same endpoint, especially given the complexities introduced by the exponential terms with complex numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
