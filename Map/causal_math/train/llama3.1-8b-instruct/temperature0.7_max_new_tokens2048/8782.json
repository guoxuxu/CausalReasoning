  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. Let's analyze the effect of applying the Laplace transform with respect to time on the equation, transforming the wave equation into the s-domain.\n\nAfter observing the transformed wave solution \\\\( U(s,x) \\\\) in the s-domain, can one determine unambiguously the initial physical conditions \\\\( u(0,x) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}(0,x) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the form of the transform used?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome in the s-domain might incorporate effects from initial conditions and the specific nature of the Laplace transform used. Without precise knowledge of how the Laplace transform was applied (e.g., which boundary conditions were transformed), the original initial conditions cannot be uniquely inferred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
