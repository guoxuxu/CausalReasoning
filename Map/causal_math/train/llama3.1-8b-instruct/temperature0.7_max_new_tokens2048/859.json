  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution u(x,t) across a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\int_0^L e^{-ax} u(x,t) dx \\\\), where a is a constant and L is the length of the rod.\n\nIf at a certain time t1 < T a new boundary condition is introduced, modifying u on the boundaries of the rod, will the integral \\\\( g(u(T)) \\\\) depend solely on k and not on the details of the new boundary condition?",
  "Explanation": "Introduction of a new boundary condition affects the temperature distribution throughout the rod, thereby altering the solution u(x,T) of the heat equation. Consequently, \\\\( g(u(T)) \\\\), which is dependent on the distribution u(x,T), will reflect the influence of both the thermal diffusivity k and nuances of the new boundary condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal diffusivity constant k directly influences the temperature distribution u across the rod, which in turn influences the integral g(u) of the temperature distribution over the rod. The new boundary condition at time T influences the temperature distribution u across the rod, but the influence of the new boundary condition on the integral g(u) is mediated by the temperature distribution u."
