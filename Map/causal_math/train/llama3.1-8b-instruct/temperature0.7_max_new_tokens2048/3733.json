  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the linear time-invariant differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = My + Nu \\), with \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) as constant matrices and \\( u(t) \\) as the control input. An operator \\( T(y) = e^{Ky} \\) is introduced, where \\( K \\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( T(y) \\) is applied to the initial condition \\( y_0 \\) at t = 0, and \\( y(t) \\) is then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{y} = My \\) without further intervention, will \\( y(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( y_0 \\) was directly evolved under \\( \\dot{y} = My \\) without applying \\( T(y) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( T(y) \\) to \\( y_0 \\) fundamentally changes the initial condition by the transformation \\( e^{Ky_0} \\), which affects the entire evolution of the system under \\( \\dot{y} = My \\). The system’s trajectory, therefore, changes, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
