  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex variable function represented as \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA} ds \\cdot w \\), where A is a constant matrix and w is a constant vector representing initial conditions. Evaluate how the application of a Laplace transform, symbolized by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} \\), affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the state at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the intervention \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied at some \\\\( t_1 \\\\), using only the transformed information?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform can provide a unique representation of the function in the frequency domain, it does not necessarily encode causal information about mid-process interventions in an identifiable way. Different interventions could result in the same transformed state, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact nature or presence of intervention based solely on the Laplace transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
