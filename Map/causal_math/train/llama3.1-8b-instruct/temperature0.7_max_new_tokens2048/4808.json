  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is applied intermittently.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the interventions used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on the outcome observed at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The potential overlap in the influences of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( U(z) \\\\) renders it challenging to backtrack and identify the specific interventions. Both transformations modify the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in possibly nonunique ways, leading to ambiguities concerning their individual or combined impacts at any given time point.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
