  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(T[z](s)\\\\), can we infer the exact original function, specifically its frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "The form of the Laplace transform \\\\(T[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\\\) uniquely determines \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) as the imaginary part of the pole, allowing for exact inference of the original function's frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
