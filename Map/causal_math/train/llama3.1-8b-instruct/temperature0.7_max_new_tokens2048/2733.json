  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The system undergoes analysis under the influence of a transformation, \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\), with C being another constant matrix, applied at an arbitrary time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which then evolves based on \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the state obtained if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) up to t = T without applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\) modifies the initial condition, thereby changing the trajectory of the system. Although both are linear transformations, the change in the initial state due to C will yield a different state at any future time T compared to the untransformed initial condition, unless C is the identity matrix or commutes perfectly with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
