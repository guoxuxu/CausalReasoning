  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) described by a complex function \\\\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant. The function is transformed by another function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is some finite time.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we deduce the value of \\\\( w \\\\) when \\\\( s \\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( w \\\\) solely from \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\) is ambiguous due to the convolution-like nature of the integration. The complex exponential terms mix in a way that does not allow for straightforward backward calculation of \\\\( w \\\\) without information on \\\\( s \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
