  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by an exponential function \\\\( e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the transformed function, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) \\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\), and then the exponential multiplier \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) is applied, will the resulting transform be equivalent to directly applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation of the Laplace Transform on \\\\( e^{at}h(t) \\\\) directly results in the shift property of the Laplace Transform. The transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{at}h(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s - a) \\\\), showing that applying the multiplier \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) early in the process or during the transform calculation results in the same outcome.",
