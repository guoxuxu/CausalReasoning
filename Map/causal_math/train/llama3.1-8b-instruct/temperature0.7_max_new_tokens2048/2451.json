  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constants A, B, C, and D. Evaluate the system's response to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(s-t)M}z(s) ds \\\\), where M is a constant matrix.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)N}z(s) ds \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, is applied at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the original differential equations and not by the transformations M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( T[z] \\\\) and \\\\( U[z] \\\\) both alter the course and contribution of the variables in the differential equations, hence the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends critically not just on A, B, C, and D but also on how the transformations M and N have interacted with these parameters and the system's state over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
