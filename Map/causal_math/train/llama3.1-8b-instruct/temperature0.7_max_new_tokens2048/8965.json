  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x, y, t) + iv(x, y, t) \\\\), a complex-valued function of two spatial variables and time, governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions.\n\nIf the initial value of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is set to be \\\\( e^{ax+by} \\\\) (where a and b are constants), and this state evolves according to the given differential equation without any further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a later time T necessarily reflect only the effects of the original equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = -i\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, the system's evolution depends solely on the initial conditions and the specific differential equation provided. The exponential function \\\\( e^{ax+by} \\\\) satisfies the Laplacian operation and will evolve predictably under the provided partial differential equation, with effects solely attributable to the equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
