  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the system at t = 0 after observing the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane over time without knowing the initial position?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) specifically the rate of rotation around the origin directly corresponds to the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). By analyzing the periodicity of the trajectory, we can determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
