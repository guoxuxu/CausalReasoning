  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its transformation by a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(z+w)(\\\\omega) \\\\) after adding \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and applying the Fourier Transform, can we determine what the exact original functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) were, only from \\\\( F(z+w)(\\\\omega) \\\\) across all frequencies?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\) separately from their combined Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z+w)(\\\\omega) \\\\) isn't straightforward without additional constraints or information about either function. The issue lies in the non-uniqueness of decomposition in the sum of transforms, as multiple pairs of functions (\\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\)) can result in the same combined transform.",
