  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\mu |z|^2z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real frequency parameter, and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) is a nonlinear growth rate parameter. Now, let's the consider the Fourier transform of the solution \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is initially given by \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and evolves naturally according to its differential equation, will the Fourier transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time t = T, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(T)\\\\}\\\\), be purely determined by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\), without any external input?",
  "Explanation": "Since the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is solely based on its intrinsic parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\), the resulting transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(T)\\\\}\\\\) will reflect these parameters. No external input is considered in this scenario, hence the Fourier transform's characteristics at time T are inherently determined by the dynamics of the differential equation itself.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
