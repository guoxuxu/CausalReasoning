  "Problem": "Consider a differential system expressed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix representing the dynamics of the system. We explore the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\{Dx\\\\})(s)\\\\) and observe how the system behaves with an intruding function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(t)x \\\\).\n\nGiven the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\(x(s)\\\\) resulting in \\\\(x(t)\\\\), can we ascertain the exact initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) if we do not know whether an intervening function like \\\\(g(x) = \\\\sin(t)x\\\\) was applied during the dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the possible application of \\\\(g(x)\\\\), which could potentially affect the system during its evolution, we cannot confidently backtrack the exact original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) from \\\\(x(t)\\\\). The interference might alter the dynamics significantly, making it indistinguishable solely through inverse operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
