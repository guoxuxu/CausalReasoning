  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function f(z) where f is an analytic function of the complex variable z. We're examining the effect of two transformations on f: multiplication by e^z, and application of the Fourier Transform denoted as F.\n\nAfter applying the transformation e^z to f(z), and subsequently observing the result from an arbitrary Fourier Transform F, can we uniquely ascertain f(z) from this outcome without further data?",
  "Explanation": "The operations involved, including multiplication by e^z and the Fourier Transform, significantly transform f(z). Given the general impact of these transformations and without additional constraints or data on the original function or the nature of e^z, retrieval of f(z) just from the output state is generally not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
