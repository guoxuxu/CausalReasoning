  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) mapping from the complex numbers to complex numbers. Let's evaluate transformations induced by this function in the context of signal processing, particularly using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a function \\\\( g(t) = t \\\\), and apply \\\\( f \\\\) to the Laplace transformed function.\n\nFrom observing the result of a Laplace transform output, can we establish that the input function was \\\\( t^2 \\\\) and deduce that \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied to \\\\( t \\\\) rather than to the Laplace transform directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a squared function (given \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\)) yields a unique result, e.g., \\\\( 2/s^3 \\\\) for \\\\( t^2 \\\\). Without additional information about whether \\\\( f \\\\) was applied pre or post transformation, or directly to \\\\( t \\\\), the exact cause (application timing and method of \\\\( f \\\\)) cannot be precisely inferred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
