  "Problem": "Consider a vector space V over complex numbers, governed by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\). The causal structure of the system is manipulated using a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(t) e^{-iwt} dt \\\\), where w represents angular frequency and v(t) is a vector in V at time t.\n\nObserving the output \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at time T, can we decipher whether the initial condition was the output of a Fourier transform of some vector \\\\( v(0) \\\\) without being informed about the application of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( u(T) \\\\), and without knowledge of the Fourier transform application, it isn't feasible to uniquely determine if the original condition was a Fourier-transformed vector or a standard vector from V. Both could reach the same state under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), especially if the operator's structure allows similar transformations in both the time and frequency domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
