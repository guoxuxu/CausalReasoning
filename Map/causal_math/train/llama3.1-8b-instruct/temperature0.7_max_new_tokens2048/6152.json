  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) that describes a rotating vector in the complex plane, influenced by the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We examine the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) to observe the behavior over a period \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformation output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we accurately trace back and determine if an intervention changed \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and what the initial \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) was?",
  "Explanation": "The integration process of \\\\( T \\\\) blends the effects of any changes smoothly, making it extremely challenging to differentiate whether there was an intervention, what its nature was, and what the initial frequency conditions were, solely from the transformed output at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
