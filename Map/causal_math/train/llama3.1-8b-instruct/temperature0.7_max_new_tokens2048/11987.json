  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix and T is a specific time period.\n\nCan the exact transformations applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both) be determined solely by the observation of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) and knowing the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear interaction and potential non-commutative effects among the exponential and integral transforms caused by matrices A, B, C, and D, the exact sequence or type of transformations applied cannot be uniquely determined from the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
