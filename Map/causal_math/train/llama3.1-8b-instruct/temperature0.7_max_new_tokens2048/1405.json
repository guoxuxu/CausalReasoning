  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) along a straight path from 0 to \\\\\\\\((( z \\\\\\\\)), will the integral value at \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) be solely dependent on the end-point \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) and not on the path taken?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) is holomorphic over the entire complex plane, and by Cauchy's integral theorem, the integral of \\\\\\\\(( e^t \\\\\\\\)) between two points along any path that does not enclose any singularities (of which there are none) will only depend on the endpoints. Therefore, any straight or curved path from 0 to \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\)) will yield the same result in the absence of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
