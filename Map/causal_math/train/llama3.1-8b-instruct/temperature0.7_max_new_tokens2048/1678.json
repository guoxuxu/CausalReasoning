  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z a complex variable. We examine the effect of an integral tranformation \\\\( h(g) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) dt \\\\), with B as another constant matrix, over an interval [0, T].\n\nCan we retrieve the exact form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) by only observing \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) after it is computed without knowing B?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( h(g) \\\\) integrates \\\\( g(z) \\\\) with a function of B, making it inherently mixed with properties dependent on B. Without knowing B and how it interacts with A, we cannot unambiguously reconstruct \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
