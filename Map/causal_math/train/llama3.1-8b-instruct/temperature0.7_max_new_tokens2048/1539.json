  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, evolved under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) with \\\\( P \\\\) being a constant matrix. We also incorporate the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix, to observe changes over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (with R being a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by P and not by Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity to the system. The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes a result of the composite effects of Q, R, and P. The subsequent state evolution is dependent on how these matrices interact through their exponentials, influencing the entire trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
