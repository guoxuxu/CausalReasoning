  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Examining the impact of the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we ascertain specifically what interventions were used (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), solely based on the knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) can potentially be achieved through various combinations of applications of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\), influencing differently by the non-commutative characteristics of the matrix exponentials. Due to these multiple pathways leading to the same final state, it is impossible to precisely identify the interventions merely based on \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
