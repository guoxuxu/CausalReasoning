  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( \\\\theta(x, T) \\\\) at a time T, can we accurately deduce the original temperature distribution \\\\( T(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing the details of the flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The changes in the temperature distribution due to advection and diffusion effects caused by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) make it infeasible to retrieve the exact initial distribution without knowledge of the flow influences and parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
