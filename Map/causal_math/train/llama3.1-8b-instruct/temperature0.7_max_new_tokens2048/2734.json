  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. The system undergoes analysis under the influence of a transformation, \\\\( g(x) = Cx \\\\), with C being another constant matrix, applied at an arbitrary time \\\\( t_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we verify the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 with certainty without knowing if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), and because C might have altered the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in an unknown way, reconstructing the exact original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the observed state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at T is uncertain. The matrix C could have various possible forms affecting the back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
