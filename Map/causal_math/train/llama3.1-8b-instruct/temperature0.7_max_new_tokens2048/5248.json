  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We study the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then modifying the function using another transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), which is a transfer function in the s-domain.\n\nAfter observing the modified time-domain function resulting from the process described above, can we uniquely determine whether a transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) was applied and exactly what the transformation was?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific transformation \\\\( H(s) \\\\) used, based on the modified time-domain output, is complex because different forms of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) might produce similar or identical effects on particular signals, leading to a non-unique set of possible \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The causal path from the modified output back to the specific form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is not determinable with certainty from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
