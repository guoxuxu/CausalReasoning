  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\( V(x, t) \\), such that \\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\\\psi \\). We explore how applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\\\) affects the wave function over time.\n\nIf \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\) is performed on the wave function \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) and then it is allowed to evolve under the original Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) at time T be the same as if \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) was evolved directly to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the representation of \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) from position space to momentum space, altering how the Hamiltonian operator acts on the function, thus potentially changing the state dynamics and resulting in a different \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
