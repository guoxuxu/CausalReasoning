  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), on this function over the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the frequency peak in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) from the Fourier-transformed and time-scaled function, can we determine both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the scaling factor \\\\( a \\\\) just by analyzing the peak position?",
  "Explanation": "The position of the frequency peak in \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) after applying both transformations explicitly reflects the combination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). Since the peak directly scales with \\\\( a \\\\), recovering these parameters separately and accurately is feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
