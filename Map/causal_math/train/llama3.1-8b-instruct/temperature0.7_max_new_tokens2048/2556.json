  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), solely based on the end state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of exponential transformations (modulated by \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\mu \\\\)) can yield the same or very similar temperature distributions at the final time T. The loss of unique identifiability in terms of the precise interventions and overlap in potential transformations contribute to this ambiguity, making it difficult to backtrack and definitively identify which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
