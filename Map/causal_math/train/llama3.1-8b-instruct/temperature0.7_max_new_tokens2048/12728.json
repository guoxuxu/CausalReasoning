  "Problem": "Consider a function \\(\\ z = h(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\)\\), where x and y are variables modified by a transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\) dependent on parameters A and B.\n\nIf the transformation \\(\\ T(u, v) \\)\\) is applied to variables (u, v) at \\(\\ t = 0 \\)\\), and then \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) is computed without further intervention, will \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\) be equivalent to directly computing \\(\\ h(u, v) \\)\\) without applying transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) at \\(\\ t = T \\)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\(\\ T \\)\\) changes the initial inputs \\(\\ (x, y) = (e^{Au}v, e^{Bu}v) \\)\\), modifying the output of \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\). The exponential terms \\(\\ e^{Au} \\)\\) and \\(\\ e^{Bu} \\)\\) alter the trajectory of x and y, resulting in a different value of \\(\\ h(x, y) \\)\\) compared to \\(\\ h(u, v) \\)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
