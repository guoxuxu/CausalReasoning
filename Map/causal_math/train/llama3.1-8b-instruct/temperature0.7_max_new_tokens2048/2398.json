  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Analyze the impact of applying a boundary condition transformation through \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original untransformed boundary conditions after observing \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), any observed solution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple potential boundary conditions due to the additive constant k, obscuring the original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
