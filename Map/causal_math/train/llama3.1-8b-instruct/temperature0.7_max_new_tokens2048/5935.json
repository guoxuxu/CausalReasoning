  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional perturbation \\\\( p(t) = e^{Bt}z(t) \\\\), with B being another real constant, is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\) and we then look at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1, does the original governing equation still solely dictate the new state at T?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( p(t) \\\\) modifies the trajectory or state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) explicitly introducing another factor (B) into the dynamics. This alteration means that the original system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\) no longer exclusively controls the state evolution past \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
