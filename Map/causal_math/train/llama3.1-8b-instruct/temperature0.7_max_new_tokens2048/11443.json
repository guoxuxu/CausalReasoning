  "Problem": "Consider a linear differential operator \\\\(L\\\\), and assume we have a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(Lu = 0\\\\. We explore how the application of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t) dt\\\\), affects the system and the implications of causal inference in this scenario.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function by an additional term \\\\(f(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_0\\\\), leading to a new PDE \\\\(Lu = f\\\\), will the Laplace transformed solution \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x, t)\\\\}\\\\) depend entirely on the original operator L without considering the impact of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "An intervention that adds a term \\\\(f(x, t)\\\\) to the equation changes the PDE to \\\\(Lu = f\\\\). The solution to this new PDE, when subjected to the Laplace transform, inherently depends on \\\\(f\\\\) as well as \\\\(L\\\\). The Laplace transformed equation will include terms involving \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(x, t)\\\\}\\\\), and hence the solution depends on both the original operator and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
