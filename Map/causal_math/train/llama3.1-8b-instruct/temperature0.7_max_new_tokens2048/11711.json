  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions describing a signal. The signal undergoes a Fourier Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) resulting in the transformed function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf a damping function \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a positive constant, is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) before the Fourier Transform, will the modified transform \\\\(Z'(\\\\omega)\\\\) depend only on the original \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\), not on the parameter \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the damping function directly affects the time domain signal, leading to a convolution in the frequency domain with the transform of \\\\(e^{-at}\\\\). This results in a transform that depends on both \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) and the damping parameter \\\\(a\\\\), reflecting the effect of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
