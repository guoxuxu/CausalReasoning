  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\(z(t) = e^{iωt}\\\\) where \\\\(ω\\\\) is a real constant and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system undergoes a transformation by applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). Further, at a later time, an external operator applies \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iω0} \\\\), resulting in \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), and then the system is let to evolve without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Initial square mapping transforms \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\), effectively changing the frequency of oscillation from \\\\( ω \\\\) to \\\\( 2ω \\\\). This results in a different trajectory with elevated frequency, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
