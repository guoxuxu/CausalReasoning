  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We're interested in observing the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) rather than just on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) midway through the evolution introduces additional scaling and rotating effects due to \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), altering the amplitude and phase initiated by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Therefore, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reflects the consequences of both transformations, along with the inherent evolution due to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
