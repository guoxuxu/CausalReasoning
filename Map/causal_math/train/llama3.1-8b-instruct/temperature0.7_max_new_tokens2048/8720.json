  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices, and x is the initial condition. We examine the effects of an input transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the output at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether transformations \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\) or \\\\( k(x) = Fx \\\\) or both were applied is inherently complex due to the potential overlapping effects of D and F on the state of the system. Multiple transformation sequences could lead to the same final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the linearity and potential overlapping impacts of these transformations interacting with the dynamics imposed by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
