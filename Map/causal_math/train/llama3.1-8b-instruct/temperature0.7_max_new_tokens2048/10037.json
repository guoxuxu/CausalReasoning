  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions and their derivatives are effected by the Laplace Transform. Here, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ v(t) \\\\} = V(s) \\\\), with s representing the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) and then the functions evolve naturally in the time domain, will the final system states in the complex plane be determined solely by their initial states?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform alters the original functions by converting them into their frequency domain counterparts, which affects how the functions evolve back in the time domain depending on the poles and zeros of U(s) and V(s). The original system states are thus not the sole determinants of the final states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace Transform of u(t) → U(s); Laplace Transform of v(t) → V(s); U(s) → u(t); V(s) → v(t); u(t) → z(t); v(t) → z(t); u(t) and v(t) evolving naturally → z(t) evolving naturally; z(t) evolving naturally → final system state in the complex plane; u(t) and v(t) initial states → u(t) and v(t) evolving naturally; u(t) and v(t) evolving naturally → z(t) evolving naturally"
