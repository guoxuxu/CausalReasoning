  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( v(p) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} u(x) dx \\\\), where p is a complex number. We explore how modifications to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) impact \\\\( v(p) \\\\) through causal inference, particularly examining the effects of differential operators and external interventions.\n\nIf we apply a transformation operator \\\\( T(x) = x^2 \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) before a differential operation and then perform the integral transformation, does the outcome \\\\( v(p) \\\\) at a fixed p depend solely on the initial form of \\\\( u(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by transforming \\\\( u(x) \\\\) with \\\\( x^2 \\\\) and then applying a differential operator significantly alters the function before integration, leading to a complex dependency on the nature of \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( D_x \\\\). Thus, the final outcome in \\\\( v(p) \\\\) depends not only on the original function but also on the intervened transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
