  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x + e^{iBt}y \\\\) where x and y are constant vectors and A, B are constant matrices. The function describes the evolution of a vector in a complex plane subjected to two rotational effects.\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine if the intervention \\\\( h(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) was applied, solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of the initial vectors x, y, and the matrices A, B, C. Without specific details on when and how the intervention was applied, multiple configurations could lead to the same endpoint, making it impossible to uniquely identify the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
