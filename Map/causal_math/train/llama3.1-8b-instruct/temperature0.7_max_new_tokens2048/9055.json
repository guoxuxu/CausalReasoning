  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function z defined as the convolution of two functions x and h on a real line, denoted as z(t) = (x * h)(t). This convolution operation represents the integral of the product of x shifted by -s and h, as function of s from negative to positive infinity. The analysis focuses on how differentiating z with respect to t, as well as considering the Fourier transform of x and h, impacts the resulting function.\n\nIf at a certain moment \\\\( t = t_0 \\\\) an impulse function is applied as an intervention on function h, does this affect the convolution z at all times t?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an impulse function in h at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) acts essentially as a Dirac delta function, which leaves a clear signature on z by adding the scaled version of x at \\\\( t_0 \\\\); hence it changes z at all times t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
