  "Problem": "Analyze the effect on signal transduction in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution operation with an impulse response function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This study involves examining the introduction of a Fourier transform of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) transformed by a function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) and its implications on the system's output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is observed, can we determine precisely the interventions used (whether \\\\( F(w) \\\\), \\\\( G(w) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of spectral transformations (\\\\( F(w) \\\\) and \\\\( G(w) \\\\)) could lead to the same output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) due to their variable influence on the signal's spectrum. The overlap in possible modifications by different Fourier transforms makes it impossible to uniquely deduce the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
