  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that operates on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined over some domain, and a transformation \\\\( T \\\\) represented by the integral \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-(x-s)} u(s) ds \\\\). We analyze the effect of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on the function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and how it influences causal inferences in the scenario.\n\nBased on the final state \\\\( L[T[\\\\hat{T}[u]]](x) \\\\), can we precisely determine whether the original function was subjected to both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\hat{T} \\\\) or only one of them, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final result, it is challenging to conclusively backtrack the types and sequence of transformations applied (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( \\\\hat{T} \\\\), both, or in what order), especially without extra context about the nature of operator \\\\( L \\\\) and the interaction dynamics between \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\hat{T} \\\\). The transformations could potentially generate similar outcomes making their individual effects indistinct.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
