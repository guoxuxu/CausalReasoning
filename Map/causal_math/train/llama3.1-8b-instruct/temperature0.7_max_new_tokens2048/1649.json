  "Problem": "Examine the causal implications in the solution domain of the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bz^2\\\\), where A and B are matrices. We will consider the effects of implementing an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Bs}s ds \\cdot z \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) is applied at initial time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bz^2\\\\) without further changes, will the solution \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T be equivalent to the solution obtained by merely evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the same differential equation without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) essentially modifies the initial condition, which impacts how the non-linear terms \\\\( Bz^2 \\\\) influence the trajectory of the solution over time. This results in a fundamentally different trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) compared to an untransformed initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
