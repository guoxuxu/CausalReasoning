  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = Xe^{At} \\\\) defining a complex dynamical system, where X is a complex matrix and A is a constant matrix. We are investigating how the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) affects the system behavior over the variable s.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform without any subsequent modifications, will the resulting transformation \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) remain unaffected by changes in the matrix A after the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is directly dependent on the matrix A, as it influences the behavior of the exponential term in the original function, thereby affecting the outcome of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
