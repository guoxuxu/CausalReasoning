  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are variables transformed via integral transformations applied as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\) and \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\) using the Laplace transform. The transformed function is expressed as \\\\( Z(s) = F(X(s), Y(s)) \\\\). We analyze how these transformations affect the relationships and dependencies between the original functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) after known interventions on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the nature of the interventions and the unchanged function \\\\( y(t) \\\\), just by observing \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific intervention and the unchanged function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) is challenging without additional information. The transformation masks the specific impacts of modifications brought by interventions due to overlapping effects in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
