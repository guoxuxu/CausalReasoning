  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\) based on a fixed complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number. This dynamic is influenced by performing different integral transformations on \\\\( z \\\\) over time.\n\nAfter observing the value of \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 1 \\\\), is it possible to determine whether an integral transformation was applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), it is challenging to reverse engineer the process since many potential transformations could yield the same final observed outcome, particularly in the complex domain where multiple inputs may result in the same output due to non-linearity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
