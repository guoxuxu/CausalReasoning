  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\). We explore the impact of transforming the variable \\\\(u\\\\) using a transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a value \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u^2 = 0\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T differ from the evolution of \\\\( u_0 \\\\) directly under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( u_0 + k \\\\). The nonlinear nature of the equation means that solutions depend sensitively on initial conditions. This shift results in a different trajectory, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
