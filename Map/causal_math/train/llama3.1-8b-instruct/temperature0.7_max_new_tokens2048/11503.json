  "Problem": "Consider a function represented by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We explore the effects of this function in the context of integral transformations on the complex plane, specifically using the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nIf during the integration process, an intervention where another transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at a specific point \\\\( z_1 \\neq z_0 \\\\), does this intervention affect the value of the integral \\\\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z_1 \\\\) changes the function within the contour \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) unless \\\\( z_1 \\\\) is outside the contour. The new function form in part of the region leads to different singularities or residue contributions, thus altering the value of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
