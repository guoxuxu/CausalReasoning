  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix, and relate its transformations to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\}(s) \\\\) and its inverse. We assess scenarios when intervening by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) for another constant matrix \\\\( B \\\\).\n\nCan the original transformation at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) be perfectly deduced by simply knowing the outcome \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at some point \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation was originally applied at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the original conditions or whether a transformation like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, there are multiple potential transformations that could lead to the same \\\\( u(T) \\\\), especially considering the potentially complex dynamics influenced by the properties of \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
