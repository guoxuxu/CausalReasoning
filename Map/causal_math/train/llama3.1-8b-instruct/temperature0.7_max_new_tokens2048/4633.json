  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the influence of applying a Fourier transform, where the transform is defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is given and the system evolves according to the specified differential equation, will applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) yield the same result as if the transform was applied directly to the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the evolving function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) incorporates the entire history and behavior of the function overtime, influenced by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\). In contrast, a transform applied directly to the initial condition would not account for the dynamic evolution under the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
