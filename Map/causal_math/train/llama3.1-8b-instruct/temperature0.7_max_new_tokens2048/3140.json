  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is used to modify the initial conditions of a particle's state in a quantum system described by \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is a unitary time evolution operator.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(w) \\\\), \\\\( h(w) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( g(w) \\\\) and \\\\( h(w) \\\\) alter the phase of the wave function in a dependent manner on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) respectively, multiple combinations of these parameters can yield the same observed state at \\\\( T \\\\). Hence, it is not feasible to uniquely identify which interventions were employed based on the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
