  "Problem": "Consider a complex system whose evolution is governed by a non-linear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = N(z)\\\\), where \\\\(N(z)\\\\) denotes a non-linear operator involving complex functions. We study the effect of a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), which translates the function from the time domain to the complex frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then it evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = N(z)\\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( z(s) \\\\) at a complex frequency s correspond to what would have been obtained if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was transformed after evolving to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = N(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The non-linearity of \\\\( N(z) \\\\) and subsequent evolution alters the function in the time domain in a way that the initial Laplace transform \\\\( h(z_0) \\\\) no longer corresponds to the transformed state of the evolved function due to the differential characteristics of \\\\( N(z) \\\\). The Laplace transform of the evolved function would reflect the cumulative changes including non-linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
