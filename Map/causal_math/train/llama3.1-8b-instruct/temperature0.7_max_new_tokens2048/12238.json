  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a Laplace transform where the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Ky \\\\) governs the evolution of the function y(t). We apply a transformation \\\\( f(y) = L^{-1}(P(s) L(y(s))) \\\\), where P(s) is a polynomial in s and L denotes the Laplace transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention such as \\\\( h(y) = L^{-1}(Q(s) L(y(s))) \\\\) is applied (where Q(s) is another polynomial), will the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on K and not on P(s) or Q(s)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces another layer of alteration via multiplication by Q(s). This additional transformation, coupled with the initial transformation from P(s), further modifies the solution. The final state \\\\( y(T) \\\\) thus depends on K, P(s), and Q(s), and not merely on K.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
