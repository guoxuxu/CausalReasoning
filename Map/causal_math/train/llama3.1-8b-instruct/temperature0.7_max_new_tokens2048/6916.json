  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant and u is a function of both x and t. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), is applied to u resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), where k represents the wave number in the transformed domain.\n\nKnowing the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at T, is it possible to determine precisely what transformations or operations were applied (whether it was just \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) or G as well), solely based on \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of transformations and interventions due to linearity and superposition principles in the Fourier domain. Without additional information about intermediate states or specific characteristics of the applied operations, the exact sequence and nature of interventions cannot be determined uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
