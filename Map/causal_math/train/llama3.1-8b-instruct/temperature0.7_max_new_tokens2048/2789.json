  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and its transformation by an integral operator \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{-it}z(t) dt \\\\). Analyze this transformation and its properties.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is as defined, will applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then letting it evolve without any intervention change the nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a kernel function \\\\( e^{-it} \\\\), effectively altering the original function. Although \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself as a function of time remains periodic, the operation by \\\\( T \\\\) computes a Fourier-type integral that essentially changes the information contained within the function, specifically evaluating to zero, thus changing the 'nature' or representation of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
