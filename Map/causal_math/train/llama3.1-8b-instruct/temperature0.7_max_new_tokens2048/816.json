  "Problem": "We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform to a time-dependent signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), on its related differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t) = 0 \\\\), where 'a' is a constant.\n\nBy observing the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely identify which transformations \\\\( h(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specifics of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) based solely on the observed \\\\( X(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the potential overlapping effects and similar spectral alterations these transformations can cause. This ambiguity prevents a unique determination of the interventions' nature or sequence.",
