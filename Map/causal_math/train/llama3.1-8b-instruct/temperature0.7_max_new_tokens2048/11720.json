  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{z} \\) acting over the complex plane, where transformations are applied via complex integral transformations such as the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\). The system explores changes in the complex function domain and their propagation through the transformation.\n\nBased on the output from \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\) after interventions, can we precisely deduce whether the transformation \\( g(z) \\) was applied and its specific form, just from knowing the transformed output?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise intervention from the transformed output is complex, as multiple different forms of \\( g(z) \\) could lead to similar transformed results. The lack of invertibility and unique correspondence in this context prevents precise back-calculation of the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
