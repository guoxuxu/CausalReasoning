  "Problem": "Investigate the stability of a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number denoting angular frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We consider the effect of an external transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be a simple rotation about the origin in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = cz \\\\) modifies the magnitude and potentially the phase of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), resulting in a trajectory that is not merely a rotation by \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\), but is scaled and rotated differently according to the magnitude and argument of \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
