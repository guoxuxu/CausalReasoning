  "Problem": "Consider a differential system expressed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix representing the dynamics of the system. We explore the application of the Laplace transform \\\\(L = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\{Dx\\\\})(s)\\\\) and observe how the system behaves with an intruding function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(t)x \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 transforming it to the frequency domain and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) without any further transformation, will the behavior of x(s) in the s-domain represent the same dynamics of the original system \\\\(x(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the Laplace transform initially, we convert the time-domain characteristics of the system into the frequency domain based on its linear dynamic properties represented by D. Assuming no further transformation, the dynamics of x(s) will encapsulate those of x(t) via the transform, therefore maintaining consistency in system behavior across both domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
