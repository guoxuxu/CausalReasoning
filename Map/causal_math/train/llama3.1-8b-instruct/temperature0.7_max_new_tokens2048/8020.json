  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is also a constant matrix. The transformation occurs over time t concerning an initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were employed (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-commutative properties of exponentials of matrices and potential overlaps in their effects, the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be a result of various combinations of interventions or transformations applied at different times. This overlap makes it difficult to uniquely identify the specific interventions based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
