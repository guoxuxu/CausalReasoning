  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex variable function described by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real numbers, in an integral transformation context.\n\nUsing the complex function outcome at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can one conclusively identify if the intervention \\\\( e^{Ct}z \\\\) was applied at any particular \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-linear integration and transformation properties of the complex exponential function, multiple scenarios could lead to the same end result observed at \\\\( t = T \\\\). This ambiguity prevents direct inference of specific interventions, particularly without knowing the exact parameters of the initial and intervened variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
