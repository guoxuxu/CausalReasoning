  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant thermal diffusivity. Examine the impact of applying a transformation with the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the exponential term \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) in the initial condition via \\\\( f(u) \\\\) can significantly alter the trajectory of \\\\( u \\\\) such that the original \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified at t = T without knowing whether the transformation was applied, because the differential equation's evolution will mask the added term's effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
