  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real-valued parameter. We explore different transformations including the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the result of the Laplace transform \\( L(z)(s) \\) at s=i, can we accurately determine the specific modifications made to \\( z(t) \\) during its evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace Transform \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-it} e^{2it} \\, dt \\) at any s includes contributions over an infinite range, making it infeasible to distinguish with certainty whether, how, and when \\( z(t) \\) was modified from solely the Laplace transform result; transformations blend indistinguishably.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
