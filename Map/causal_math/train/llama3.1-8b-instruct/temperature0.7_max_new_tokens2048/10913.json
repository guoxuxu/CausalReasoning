  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z = f(x) \\) defined in the complex plane, where \\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\). We are interested in the mappings done by \\( \\phi(z) = z^2 \\) and explore how these transformations affect \\( z \\) as \\( x \\) varies along the real axis.\n\nIf \\( \\phi(z) \\) is applied to \\( f(x_0) \\) where \\( x_0 \\) is a real number, and then \\( x \\) evolves to \\( x_1 \\) under the transformation \\( f(x) \\) without any intervention, will \\( z(x_1) \\) at \\( x_1 \\) remain as \\( \\phi(f(x_0)) \\) was initially?",
  "Explanation": "The square function \\( \\phi(z) \\) transforms \\( z \\) at \\( x_0 \\) independently of how \\( x \\) evolves to \\( x_1 \\). The effect of \\( f(x) \\) evolving \\( x \\) to \\( x_1 \\) and then applying \\( \\phi \\) would give a different result since \\( \\phi(f(x_1)) \\neq \\phi(f(x_0)) \\) unless \\( x_0 = x_1 \\). The transformation \\( f(x) \\) and the squaring function \\( \\phi \\) do not commute in general.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
