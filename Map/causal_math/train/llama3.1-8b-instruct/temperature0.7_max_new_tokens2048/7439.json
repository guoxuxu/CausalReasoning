  "Problem": "Let's examine a scenario involving a complex function and its transformation using a Fourier Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a frequency. We analyze the effect of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf an additional transformation, specifically an amplitude modulation given by multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a constant real factor \\\\( A \\\\) is applied, will the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(Az(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) still show a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega = \\\\omega_0 \\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a real scalar \\\\( A \\\\) does not alter the frequency content but merely scales the amplitude of the delta peak. Therefore, the Fourier Transform will still display a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), albeit with an altered amplitude corresponding to \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
