  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is a constant vector. We evaluate the impact of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 accurately after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially, it fundamentally alters the initial condition. Without knowing about this application, back-calculating to \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without considering \\\\( E \\\\) could lead to incorrect inferences about the original state, as \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\) cannot be easily decoupled from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
