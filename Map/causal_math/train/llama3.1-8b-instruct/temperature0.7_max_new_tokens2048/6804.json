  "Problem": "Considering a complex function and its transformation by a linear operator, let \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) be a time-dependent complex function. The linear operator \\( L \\) acts on \\( z \\) such that \\( L(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state of the function at time \\( T \\), can we unequivocally determine which operators were used (whether \\( L \\), \\( M \\), or both), merely by observing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping influences and potential for similar alterations in trajectory by different operators, especially when involving convolutions and complex exponentials, it is generally not feasible to definitively conclude which operations were applied to reach a specific state \\( z(T) \\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
