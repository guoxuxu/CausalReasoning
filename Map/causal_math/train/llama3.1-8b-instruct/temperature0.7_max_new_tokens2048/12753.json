  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nCan we deduce the values of constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) by analyzing the outcome of the integral \\\\( I \\\\) after applying the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral after variable transformation is impacted by multiple factors such as the new scale and shift in variable, resulting in different effects based on \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The direct relationship between the integral result and these constants isn't uniquely decodable due to the overlapping influences of both scale and shift adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "I → a and b; a and b → u; u → x; a and b → dx; a and b → I; I → behavior of the function; u → behavior of the function; x → I; a and b → x; dx → I"
