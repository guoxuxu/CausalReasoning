  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. The transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) with another constant matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is applied to assess various impacts on the function.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{QT}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0. This change in initial condition means that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will evolve differently under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), depending on the relationship between matrices P and Q, leading to a distinct state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
