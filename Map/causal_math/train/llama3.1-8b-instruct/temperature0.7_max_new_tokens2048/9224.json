  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. The solution at any time can be transformed using a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u}(k) \\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the wave number.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) and assuming various transformations could have been applied (like Fourier transformation, filtering, etc.), can we determine exactly what interventions were employed only based on \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differing effects of potential interventions (e.g., Fourier transformation, filtering specific modes) and the possible overlap in their outcomes make it challenging to distinctly attribute \\\\( u(T) \\\\) to specific earlier interventions without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
