  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic process described by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\(s(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-pt} s(t) dt\\\\), where t is time and p is a complex variable. We explore the effects of modifying this function by a convolution with another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) defined in the time domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\(s(t)\\\\) is convoluted with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) forming \\\\(s*h(t)\\\\), and then its Laplace transform is taken, will the transformed function \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p)\\\\) be the same as the product of the Laplace transforms of \\\\(s\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) individually, i.e., \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(p)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the convolution theorem in the context of Laplace transforms, the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their Laplace transforms. Thus, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(s*h)(p) = \\\\mathcal{L}(s)(p) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(h)(p)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
