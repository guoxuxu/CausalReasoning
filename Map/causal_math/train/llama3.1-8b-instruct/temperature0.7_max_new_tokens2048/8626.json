  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact of the Laplace Transform on a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) that represents a time-domain signal, specifically focusing on how applying the inverse Laplace Transform affects inference regarding the original function.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without further operations, can we completely reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity or loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the Laplace Transform is invertible for its domain of definable functions, the inverse Laplace Transform will accurately reconstruct \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\), assuming no operational errors and exact transformation conditions being met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
