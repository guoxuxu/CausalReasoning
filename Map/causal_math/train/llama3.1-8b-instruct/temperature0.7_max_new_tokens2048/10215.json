  "Problem": "Consider a boundary value problem for the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a bounded region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) with boundary conditions specified by a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\). We investigate the influence of applying a Fourier transform to the boundary data \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then solving the modified problem.\n\nIf an additional intervention modifies the boundary data from \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) to another function \\\\( h(k) \\\\) at a later time, will the solution \\\\( u \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) depend solely on the new boundary conditions set by \\\\( h(k) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution \\\\( u \\\\) is influenced by the history of the boundary conditions due to the elliptic nature of the Laplace equation, which relies on global properties of the domain. Changes at different stages can interact in complex ways, making the solution dependent on both \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) and \\\\( h(k) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
