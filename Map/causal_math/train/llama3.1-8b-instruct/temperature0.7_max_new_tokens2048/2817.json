  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. A transformation function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is applied to investigate variations in trajectory overt time t.\n\nIf the complex function transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, does the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T match the trajectory of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolving under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions by multiplying with \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), affecting both real and imaginary parts, hence the system evolves differently leading to a distinct state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
