  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We are exploring the impact of performing a Fourier transform on this function over time and analyzing the behavior with subsequent Laplace transforms.\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform result, can we uniquely determine the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at any specific time t without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform result uniquely characterizes the frequency content of the function. Given this frequency-content information, which points to a single frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) can be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
