  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a given function and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation maps a function from the time domain to the Laplace transform in the complex domain.\n\nIf an intervention changes \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to a new function \\\\( j(t) = f(t) + k(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( k(t) \\\\) is another function, will the resulting transform \\\\( J(z) \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( G(z) \\\\) without the contributions from \\\\( k(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by adding \\\\( k(t) \\\\), therefore changing the original system. The new Laplace transform \\\\( J(z) \\\\) will be influenced by the additional function \\\\( k(t) \\\\), resulting in a transform that cannot be derived solely by knowing \\\\( G(z) \\\\) since \\\\( J(z) = G(z) + K(z) \\\\), where \\\\( K(z) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( k(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
