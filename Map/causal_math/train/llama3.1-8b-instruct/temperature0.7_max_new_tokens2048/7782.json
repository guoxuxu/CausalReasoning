  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a user-controlled input and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a fixed angular frequency. The evolution of the system is studied through the application of the Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nBased on the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without knowing its relation to the overall system behavior especially the impact of \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) contributes additional components to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) that confound the ability to back-solve uniquely for \\\\( u(t) \\\\) without additional assumptions or information. Both components are intertwined in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
