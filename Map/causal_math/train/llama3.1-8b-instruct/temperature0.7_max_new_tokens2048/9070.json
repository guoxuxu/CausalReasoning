  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent variables described by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constant matrices A, B, C, and D. We investigate the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{st} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be deduced from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some later time T, without knowing whether the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transform \\\\( T \\\\) has been applied, predicting back the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) becomes non-trivial as the transform could have significantly modified the dynamics, and multiple initial conditions could lead to similar state configurations at time T due to the integral's smoothing effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
