  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are components of a vector function under the influence of a matrix transformation given by \\\\( A \\\\). An additional transformation, a rotation in the complex plane, is introduced as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) represents the rotation angle.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is another angle) is implemented as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the matrix A or also by the angles \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial rotation by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and the subsequent intervention by \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) significantly affect the resultant vector \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in addition to the effects of A. The combination of these rotations alters the trajectory in a manner that is dependent on all factors (A, \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)), and not solely on A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
