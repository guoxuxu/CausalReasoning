  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\), can the specific interventions used (whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\), \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\), or both), be identified uniquely by only knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of the interventions and initial conditions due to the nature of phase shifts and their interplay. The specific history of modifications (\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\)) is obscured by their potentially offsetting influences, making unique determination impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
