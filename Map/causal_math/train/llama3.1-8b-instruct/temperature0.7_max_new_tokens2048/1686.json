  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the profile \\\\(u(T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the exact initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowing whether or not the function \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\(f(u)\\\\) was initially applied, the existence of the exponential term \\\\(e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) cannot be confirmed from the final state alone, especially since the transformations influencing equation dynamics are unknown. This uncertainty prevents a deterministic back-calculation of \\\\(u_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
