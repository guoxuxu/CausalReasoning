  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = g(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix and x is a complex variable. We examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) in analyzing the system for various conditions.\n\nKnowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to determine the specific time and nature (shift by c) of the intervention applied, assuming the initial conditions and M are known?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of initial conditions and M, multiple interventions (shifts by different constants c at different times) can produce the same effect in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at T due to the linearity and temporal aggregation in the Laplace transform, making it impossible to precisely pinpoint the intervention specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
