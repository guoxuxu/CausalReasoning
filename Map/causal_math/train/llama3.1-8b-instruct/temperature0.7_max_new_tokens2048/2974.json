  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable and f(t) is a real-valued function. We explore the impact applying a Laplace transform on this function and then examining its behavior under various conditions.\n\nAfter observing the Laplace transform outcome \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of a function, can we categorically reconstruct the exact form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), without knowing any specifics about its formulation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is generally not injective across all possible functions, meaning different functions can have the same Laplace transform (e.g., functions differing by a null function on the Laplace transform domain). Without additional information about specific constraints or the function behavior, exact reconstruction isn't always feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform → transform outcome G(s); knowing G(s) → reconstructing f(t); knowledge of specifics about f(t) formulation → reconstructing f(t); knowing specifics about f(t) formulation → knowing G(s)"
