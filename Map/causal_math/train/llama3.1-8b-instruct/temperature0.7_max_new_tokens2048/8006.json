  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping in complex analysis, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant complex frequency. We look into the effects of a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) applied at initial time t = 0.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be deduced from the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) without additional data on its form or the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform characterizes the function broadly, recovering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) requires additional knowledge such as the specific complex frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), because different frequencies can yield different transform outcomes even if the structure looks similarly integrated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
