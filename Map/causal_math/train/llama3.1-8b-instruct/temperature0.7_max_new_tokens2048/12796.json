  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = bx + ay \\\\), where a and b are constants. We assess the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform applied to both components x(t) and y(t).\n\nIf the initial conditions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) undergo a Laplace transform and are then evolved according to the differential equations without any further manipulation, will the system's trajectory be the same as if no transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a Laplace transform to the initial conditions effectively changes the initial state of the system in the complex plane, leading to a different evolution under the differential equations. This transformation modifies the frequency components of the initial conditions, resulting in a trajectory that does not correspond to the untransformed case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
