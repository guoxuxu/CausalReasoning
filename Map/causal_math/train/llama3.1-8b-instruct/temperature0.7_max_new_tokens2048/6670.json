  "Problem": "Consider the system of complex functions defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is iterated over time t, generating a sequence in the complex plane that can exhibit dynamics typical of the Julia set. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix, on this sequence.\n\nAfter observing a sequence at t = T, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and given that this transformation could have significantly modified the initial conditions, reversing the operations to uniquely retrieve \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is not possible. The function's sensitivity to initial conditions in a complex dynamical system, such as those forming the Julia set, makes this recovery especially difficult.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
