  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is subject to a transformation using a linear time-invariant system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}y(t) = Ay(t) + Bx(t) \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices, and the transformation \\\\( h(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is a filter applied to the output signal, with C and D also being constant matrices.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( y(t) \\\\) under the system without any filter applied, will the polynomial degree of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be increased by applying the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to it after processing?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential term \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) will introduce new dynamics to the function \\\\( y(t) \\\\), potentially increasing the polynomial degree or altering its structure, depending on the non-zero components and eigenvalues of D in relation to A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
