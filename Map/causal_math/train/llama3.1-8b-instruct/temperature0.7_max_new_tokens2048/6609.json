  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\), where M is a skew-symmetric matrix. Analyze the effect of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\) over time t, where N is another skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) initially modifies the state by \\\\( e^{Nt}x_0 \\\\), potentially altering the trajectory of the system. The resulting state, \\\\( x(T) \\\\), depends on both matrices M and N, and their relationship affects the dynamics through matrix commutation properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x_0 → x(t); N → h(x); h(x) → x(t); M → dx/dt; dx/dt → x(t); e^(Nt) → x(t); M → N; x(t) → h(x)"
