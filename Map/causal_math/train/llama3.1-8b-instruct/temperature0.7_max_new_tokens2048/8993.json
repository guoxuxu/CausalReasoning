  "Problem": "A system is governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + Az\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We explore the role of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a different constant matrix influencing the trajectory over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and this state is then evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = z^2 + Az\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) transforms the initial state to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\), and the nonlinear nature of the original differential equation means the trajectory of the system will subsequently diverge from that of the untransformed initial state. The exponential transformation by B can alter the trajectory substantially, especially in interaction with the nonlinearity and A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
