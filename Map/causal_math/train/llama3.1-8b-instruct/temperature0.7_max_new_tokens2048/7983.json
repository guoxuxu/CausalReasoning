  "Problem": "Consider a physical system characterized by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) represents a potential function in a field. The transformation applied is through a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex representation of spatial coordinates.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-iz} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the solution \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y, T)\\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original Laplace equation settings and not on the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the spatial basis again, with the result that the final potential field \\\\(\\\\phi(T)\\\\) will not only be influenced by the original Laplace system but will also be a composite effect of both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), each contributing to altering the overall field distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
