  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) in the complex plane, and its transformation by a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\). We explore how manipulating the function and its transform affects causal relationships within these systems.\n\nGiven the transformed system \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we deduce the exact original function \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( z = w^2 \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the squared function introduces ambiguity between positive and negative roots, hence \\\\( w \\\\) or \\\\( -w \\\\) could have led to the same \\\\( z \\\\). Without additional information, the recovery of \\\\( w \\\\) solely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) is not unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
