  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) \\\\) represents the transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The impact of a linear operator \\\\( A \\\\) acting on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to produce a new function \\\\( g(t) = A f(t) \\\\) is being analyzed, where the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t))(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) after the application of \\\\( A \\\\) and transformation to the s-domain, without knowing the form of \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without knowing the operator \\\\( A \\\\) is generally impossible because multiple different operators \\\\( A \\\\) might yield the same transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\), especially without knowing how \\\\( A \\\\) alters the functions in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
