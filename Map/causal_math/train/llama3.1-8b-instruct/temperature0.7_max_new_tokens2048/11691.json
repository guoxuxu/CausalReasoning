  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where a function's domain and range are controlled by differential equations \\\\(dx/dt = Px\\\\) and \\\\(dy/dt = Qy\\\\), where P and Q are constant matrices. We investigate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T[x(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{Rs}x(s) ds\\\\) on x(t), where R is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at some time t_1 a new operation \\\\(U[x(t)] = x(t) + e^{Mt}x(t)\\\\) is applied where M is another constant matrix, will the state x(T) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on R or M?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the operation \\\\(U[x(t)]\\\\) adds additional complexity, affecting the trajectory and final state x(T). This state now depends on the behaviors of P, R, and M, particularly how they influence the exponential growth and system dynamics over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
