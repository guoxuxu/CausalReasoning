  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is analytically mapped using a Mobius transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( ad - bc \\\\neq 0 \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we determine exactly which transformations were used (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) based solely on knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), there could be multiple combinations of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and initial states that result in the same endpoint due to the nature of Mobius transformations and their ability to widely vary the path and final positions in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
