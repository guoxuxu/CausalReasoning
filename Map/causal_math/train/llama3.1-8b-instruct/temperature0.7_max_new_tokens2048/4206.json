  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. Let's delve into the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) applied over time t, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) can change the initial conditions beyond recognition, especially if \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) have varied sensitivities to phase changes introduced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Without this knowledge, the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
