  "Problem": "Consider the behaviour of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\), under the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\). Analyze how transformations affect causality in the complex function mapping and their implications on the frequency domain.\n\nIf an intervention by scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with a factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is applied at a time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), will the Laplace Transform output at any \\\\( s \\\\) solely depend on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) regardless of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the function to \\\\( e^{(\\\\alpha+i\\\\omega) t} \\\\). The Laplace Transform of this new function, \\\\( \\mathcal{L}[z](s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(\\\\alpha+i\\\\omega)} \\\\), clearly depends on both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Thus, the output at any \\\\( s \\\\) will reflect contributions from both the scaling intervention and the original frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
