  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( Y(S, t) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether just \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), just \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), or both) based solely on the observation of \\\\( Y(S, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint after multiple transformations being influenced by different operational domains (frequency and complex-plane due to Fourier and Laplace respectively) makes it challenging to decode precisely which transformations or their sequence was applied. The overlap and the cumulative effect of such transformations obscure the singular effects, preventing precise retrospective identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
