  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a system characterized by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. Then, an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T[x](t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(u) e^{-atu} du \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nDoes the application of the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) followed by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) without any further intervention result in the same output as just applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for all \\\\( t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) acts as an additional transformation layer that modulates and potentially alters the signal in ways that the original transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone does not account for. The nature of the integral transformation can significantly modify the frequency and time-domain characteristics of the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
