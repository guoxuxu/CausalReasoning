  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Az\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function, \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant, and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is a constant matrix, over different times t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and A, not B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention introduces additional dynamics, making the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and A but also the effects of B and C. The transform states and the combined influence of these matrices modify the trajectory leading up to time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
