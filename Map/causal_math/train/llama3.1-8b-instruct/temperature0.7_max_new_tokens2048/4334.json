  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this function.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the signal \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), allowing us to precisely determine the frequency of the original signal from its transform, as it explicitly marks the presence of frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and no other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → signal z(t); angular frequency ω → signal z(t); signal z(t) → Fourier transform; ω is a property of signal z(t)"
