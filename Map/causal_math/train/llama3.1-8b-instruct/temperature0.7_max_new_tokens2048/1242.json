  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions evolving over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. A transformation is applied to this system through the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) leads to an indetermination of whether exponential modifications influenced the trajectory. Without this knowledge, reconstructing the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is unreliable, as \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) can fundamentally alter initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
