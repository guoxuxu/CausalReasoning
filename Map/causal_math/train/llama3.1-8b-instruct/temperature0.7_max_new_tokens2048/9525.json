  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the function V(x), and governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\). We consider the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(x)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\xi x} x(t) dt \\\\) on the trajectory of the particle.\n\nIf the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to the trajectory \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) and then the resulting function is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting trajectory, translated back via the inverse Fourier transform, yield the same trajectory as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\nabla V(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformation modifies the frequency components of the trajectory which affects how the differential equation governs the motion. The trajectory after inverse transformation will generally not be similar to the original trajectory due to these modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
