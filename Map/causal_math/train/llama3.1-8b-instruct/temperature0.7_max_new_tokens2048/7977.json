  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega \\tau}z(\\tau)d\\tau\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from \\\\(t = 0\\\\) to \\\\(t = T\\\\) and allowed to evolve without further transformation, will the transformed state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) represent the simple accumulation of the original states over time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) effectively changes the nature of the function by performing a convolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) with \\\\(e^{-i\\omega t}\\\\), which does not merely accumulate but transforms the weighting of the function's contributions over time, affecting the entire structure and output at \\\\(t = T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
