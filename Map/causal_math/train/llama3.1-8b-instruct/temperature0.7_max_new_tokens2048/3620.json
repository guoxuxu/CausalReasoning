  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k > 0 \\\\) is a constant. Analyses include transforming the function via \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we determine the specific transformations applied (\\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both) at earlier times by examining the function \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), it is difficult to definitively identify which transformations were applied and at what times, due to the overlapping influences of the exponential modifiers on the function's trajectory. This ambiguity arises because the combined effects of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\) could lead to similar outcomes for different initial or intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
