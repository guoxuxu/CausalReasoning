  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Az\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function, \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant, and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is a constant matrix, over different times t.\n\nCan we determine precisely the interventions used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or none) solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcomes observed in \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially result from different sequences or applications of interventions, making it unclear whether only \\\\( f(z) \\\\), only \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both were applied. The overlapping effects and non-commutativity of matrix exponentials render the exact historical interventions indeterminable from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
