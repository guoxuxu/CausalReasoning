  "Problem": "Consider a system in a complex plane characterized by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which must hold for a function \\\\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\\\) to be analytic in a region. Let \\\\( T \\\\) represent a transformation where \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\) and explore this transformation's effect on the analytic properties of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f'(z) = f(z) + cz^3 \\\\) (where c is a non-zero complex constant) and then applies \\\\( T(z) = z^2 \\\\), will the new function \\\\( f'(T(z)) \\\\) definitely maintain analyticity across the entire complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Both in terms of adding \\\\( cz^3 \\\\) (which is an analytic operation due to all polynomials being analytic) and then applying \\\\( z^2 \\\\), the transformations do not breach the conditions for analyticity since each component function is analytic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
