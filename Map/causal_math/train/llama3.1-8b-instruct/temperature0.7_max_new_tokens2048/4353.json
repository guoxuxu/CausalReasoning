  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under the original equations to T = t?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 to \\\\( e^{Ct}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, then this transformed state evolves under the original differential equations. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) affects the initial conditions and overall trajectory, resulting in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved without modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
