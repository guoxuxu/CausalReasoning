  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor R, inductor L, and capacitor C in series, governed by the linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). The interaction is studied using the Laplace Transform to switch between the time domain and the frequency domain.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is applied to the current \\\\(i(t)\\\\) solution of the differential equation at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the system's behavior in the frequency domain be solely dictated by the characteristics equation derived from the circuit elements R, L, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform converts the differential equation into an algebraic equation in the frequency domain. The characteristics of the resulting behavior in this domain are completely determined by the poles of the transfer function, which depend only on R, L, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
