  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) by a linear operator L, defined as \\\\(L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where A is a complex constant and T is a fixed time.\n\nIf a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is integrated using the operator L without any intermediate manipulation, will \\\\(L[z(t)]\\\\) reflect solely the properties of z(t) influenced by the exponential factor e^{At}?",
  "Explanation": "The operator L explicitly includes the exponential transformation \\\\(e^{At}\\\\) in its definition, hence the result \\\\(L[z(t)]\\\\) will directly depend on both the properties of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and the nature of the exponential factor, reflecting a pure transformation without external influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
