  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a linear operator \\\\( C \\\\) is applied to the system so that the new state becomes \\\\( z(t_1) = C (e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y) \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remain dependent on the initial matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention with \\\\( C \\\\), the following evolution of the system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) still builds upon the transitional forms \\\\( e^{A(t-T)} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{B(t-T)} \\\\), which implicates that the effect at \\\\( T \\\\) is influenced by the behaviors of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) from the initial state, modified through the transformation by \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
