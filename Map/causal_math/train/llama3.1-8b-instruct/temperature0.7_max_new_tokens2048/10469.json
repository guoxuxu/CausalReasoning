  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its effect over a region in the complex plane. Let \\\\( z \\\\) undergo a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and analyze the transformation of the region under this function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied without further intervention, will the result at point \\\\( z_1 = g(z_0) \\\\) be the same as applying \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after \\\\( g(z) \\\\) will sequentially follow as \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\), which is indeed the result of first squaring \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then taking the reciprocal of the result, reflecting a direct transformation under these operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
