  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We are interested in the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) before the system evolves.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) be unambiguously reconstructed from the Fourier transformed state \\\\( \\\\widehat{u}(k, T) \\\\) after evolution under the transformed PDE?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation and the diffusion process impact the information in \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of the transformation and diffusion details applied, reconstructing the exact original function from its evolved Fourier transform counterpart involves ambiguities and potential loss of information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
