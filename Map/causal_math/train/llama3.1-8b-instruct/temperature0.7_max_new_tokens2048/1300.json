  "Problem": "We investigate a system governed by a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) represents a matrix with complex entries and \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) is a vector in the complex plane. The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) with a constant matrix \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) is then applied to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\), can we determine with certainty what transformations were applied (whether \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\), \\\\\\( k(z) \\\\\\), or both) strictly by knowing the outcome at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) might result from various combinations of the transformations \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( k(z) \\\\\\) due to differing matrix properties and the interactions between \\\\\\( D \\\\\\), \\\\\\( F \\\\\\), and \\\\\\( A \\\\\\). The potential for overlapping or redundant effects from these transformations renders exact identification of applied functions infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
