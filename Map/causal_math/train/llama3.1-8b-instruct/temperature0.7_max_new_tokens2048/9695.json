  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation is applied to modify the frequency from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and then the function is subjected to the Laplace transform, will the resultant Laplace transform reflect only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not the modified frequency?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention altered the frequency in the function prior to the application of the Laplace transform, and this change will be reflected in the resultant transform as a pole at \\\\( s = i2\\\\omega \\\\), indicating a dependence on the new frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
