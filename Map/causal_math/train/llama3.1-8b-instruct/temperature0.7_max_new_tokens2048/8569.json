  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to this function and then subsequently its inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and then the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\) is directly applied without further manipulation, will the resulting function be identical to the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform and then the inverse Laplace transform to a function without modifications results in the original function, assuming appropriate conditions on the function and convergence properties. For \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), these transforms act as mathematical inverses without altering the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
