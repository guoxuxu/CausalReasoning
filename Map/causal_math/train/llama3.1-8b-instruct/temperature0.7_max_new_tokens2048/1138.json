  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output, can we confirm that the original function was \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a single delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\) in the Fourier transform uniquely identifies the original function as \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\), since this transform is characteristic of that specific exponential function with a single frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → output; output → original function; original function → i; i → imaginary unit; original function → e^ix; e^ix → z(x); z(x) → Fourier transform; e^ix → i; i → e^ix"
