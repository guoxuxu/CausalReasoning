  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit RLC series where \\\\(R, L, C\\\\) represent resistance, inductance, and capacitance, respectively. Let the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be a sinusoidal function described by \\\\(V(t) = V_0 \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)\\\\) where \\\\(V_0\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. Investigate how the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) changes when subjected to the Laplace transform, which encodes different input conditions or interventions.\n\nCan we deduce the exact input frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) of \\\\(V(t)\\\\) just by observing the output current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) at a single time T, without any prior knowledge of the system's initial conditions or system parameters like R, L, or C?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the initial conditions and system parameters, it's impossible to uniquely determine the input frequency purely from a single snapshot of the output current due to multiple possible system configurations and transient effects that could produce similar currents at different frequencies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
