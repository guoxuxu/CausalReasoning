  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a system's state in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix.\n\nSuppose at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Pt}z \\\\) (where P is a constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention. Will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the matrix M, without influence from N or P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new dynamics to the system, thereby modifying the trajectory. The final state at time T will depend not only on M but also on the effects of N initially and P at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The matrix M directly influences the system's state z(T), while P's influence is indirect through its effect on g(z), which in turn affects z(T)."
