  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the integral transformation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} x(s) ds \\\\), with A being a constant square matrix. The input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed using the function \\\\( g(t, x) = e^{Bt} x \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) is applied to the input function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( y(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) was directly used in the transformation to T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t, x) \\\\) modifies the input function, thus changing the initial conditions of the transformation. The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) potentially alters the nature of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) contributing to different results in the transformed output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) due to variation in integration with respect to the modified input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
