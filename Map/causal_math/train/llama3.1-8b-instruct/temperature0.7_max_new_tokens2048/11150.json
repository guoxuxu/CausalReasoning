  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a transformation, defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T if it is unknown whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied or the value of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it is impossible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), since the transformation could have altered both magnitude and phase of the original value in non-trivial ways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
