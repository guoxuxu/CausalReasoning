  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of complex transformations applied to a function \\\\(h(z)\\\\) in the complex plane, described by \\\\(h_1(z) = e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) initially and then \\\\(h_2(z) = e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\) after some time T, where A and B are complex constants.\n\nIf the final form of the function \\\\(h_2(T)\\\\) is known, can the sequence of applications (first \\\\(e^{Az}h(z)\\\\) then \\\\(e^{Bz}h_1(z)\\\\)) be reconstructed only from this final form?",
  "Explanation": "The compounded exponential transformations used in the sequential applications result in a final form where the individual operations cannot be distinctly discerned. Due to the nature of exponential functions, only the aggregated effect, expressed as a single exponential transformation, is visible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
