  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, retrieving the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible. The potential application of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could have changed the initial state, making it impossible to reverse-engineer the system's history from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
