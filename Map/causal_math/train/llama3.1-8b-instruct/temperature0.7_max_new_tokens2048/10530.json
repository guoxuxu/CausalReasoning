  "Problem": "In the context of a heat conduction problem, assume a rod along the x-axis where the temperature distribution at time t is given by the function \\( u(x,t) \\), which satisfies the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\). We consider an integral transformation \\( f(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-sx}u(x,0) \\, dx \\) (Fourier Transform) and study its impact on the solution when applied initially.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial temperature distribution \\( u(x,0) \\) precisely after observing \\( u(x,T) \\) at time T without knowing whether \\( f(u) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform is bijective on the function space under suitable conditions, the original temperature distribution \\( u(x,0) \\) can be precisely determined by applying the inverse Fourier Transform to \\( f(u) \\) computed from \\( u(x,T) \\), regardless of the initial application of \\( f(u) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
