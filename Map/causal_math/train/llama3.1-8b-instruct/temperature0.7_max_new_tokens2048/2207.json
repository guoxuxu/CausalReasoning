  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\(\\int_0^t K(t-u) x(u) du = y(t)\\), where \\(K(s)\\) is a complex kernel function and \\(x(t)\\) is the input function. We study the changes in the output \\( y(t) \\) under the transformations initiated by different input functions such as \\( g(x) = x + Ae^{-\\lambda t} \\) for some constant matrix \\( A \\) and scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(x) = x^2 + Be^{-\\mu t} \\) (where \\( B \\) is another constant matrix and \\( \\mu \\) a scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( y(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend only on the original \\( K \\) and not on \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added intervention with \\( h(x) \\) influences the input \\( x(t) \\) starting at \\( t_1 \\) and this modified input interacts through convolution with the kernel \\( K(s) \\). As such, the final state \\( y(T) \\) will be directly affected by both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) as they alter the form and trajectory of the input function over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
