  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + Au_x = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. We analyze the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx}u(x, t)\\\\, dx \\\\) over time t.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) and that an intervention occurred at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we ascertain whether the modification involved only addition of \\\\( h \\\\) or also adjustments involving the transformation function's frequency components?",
  "Explanation": "Several interventions involving different types of functions and manipulations in the Fourier domain could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\). The non-uniqueness in potential transformations and additions makes it challenging to deduce the specific nature or combination of interventions applied solely based on the endpoint in the Fourier domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
