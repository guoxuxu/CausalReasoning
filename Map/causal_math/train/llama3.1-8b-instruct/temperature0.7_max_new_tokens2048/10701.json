  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. The Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied to f, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially transformed by the Laplace transformation with matrix B and then left to function independently under its definition, will the output after a certain fixed complex plane region \\\\( z \\\\) be equivalent to the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform modifies the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) by integrating it with \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), resulting in a transformation in the complex domain which alters its behavior. This implies that the output in the fixed region will differ due to the specific impact created by B in the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
