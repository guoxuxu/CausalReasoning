  "Problem": "Analyze the transformation of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + i \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real variable. The impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) on this function is examined over a variable s, which is a complex number.\n\nIf a new function transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) (the Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention at a certain time s = t_1, will the endpoint \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the characteristics of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) and not on the initial form of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, affecting how \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is represented in the complex frequency domain by \\\\( Z(T) \\\\). The final state now depends on the initial form, characteristics of the Laplace transform, and the Fourier transform properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
