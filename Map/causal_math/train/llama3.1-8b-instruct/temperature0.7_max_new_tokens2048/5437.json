  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider an integral transformation defined by \\\\( v(x, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, y) u(y, t) dy \\\\), where K is a kernel function representing the transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) is set as a specific initial condition and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) was applied continuously over time t?",
  "Explanation": "The kernel function \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\) as part of the transformation integral can modify the impact of the linear operator L on the function u, thus changing the eventual outcome of \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) when compared to applying the transformation continuously. The transformed solution \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) might involve properties or characteristics not present in the original evolution under L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
