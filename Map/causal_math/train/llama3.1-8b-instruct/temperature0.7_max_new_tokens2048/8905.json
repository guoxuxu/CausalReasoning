  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its impact when integrated over a contour in the complex plane. The contour described by the path \\\\( C \\\\) is parameterized by \\\\( z(t) = a + te^{it} \\\\) for \\\\( t \\\\) ranging from 0 to 2\\\\pi, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf the contour \\\\( C \\\\) is modified to \\\\( C' \\\\) by changing parameter \\\\( a \\\\) to another complex number, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is integrated over \\\\( C' \\\\), will the resulting integral be the same as the original integral over \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) changes the center of the circular contour in the complex plane, which affects the values of \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) along the path. Depending on the nature of \\\\( a \\\\), the range over which the exponential function operates also changes, likely altering the integral's value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
