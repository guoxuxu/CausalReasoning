  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We're evaluating the effect of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}s ds \\\\) applied to a function z(t), where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the state by integrating an exponential transformation over time, which alters not only the scale but potentially the direction of the vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\). This results in a modified trajectory under the system \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) different than if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had evolved without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
