  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing position components in a temporal dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + B \\\\), with A and B being complex numbers.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine if the constant B was changed to B' during the evolution, knowing only that an intervention took place at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different trajectories influenced by variations in B or B', and without additional information about the nature and exact parameters of the intervention, it remains indeterminate whether the change was to B' or something else.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
