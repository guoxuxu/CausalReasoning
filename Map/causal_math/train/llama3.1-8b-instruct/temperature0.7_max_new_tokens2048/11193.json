  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} = Y(s)\\\\), where \\\\(y(t)\\\\) is the original time function. To examine any causal changes, an impulse response function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is convolved with \\\\(y(t)\\\\) resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = h(t) * y(t)\\\\). The frequency responses of \\\\(h\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are denoted by \\\\(H(s)\\\\) and \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), respectively.\n\nIf the function \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is initialized by performing the convolution \\\\(h(t) * y(t)\\\\) at t = 0, then allowed to proceed based on the same system, will the Laplace transform of \\\\(g(t)\\\\), GuardedBy \\\\(G(s)\\\\), be equivalent to the product \\\\(H(s)Y(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Based on the convolution theorem in Laplace transforms, the transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their transforms. Thus, \\\\(G(s)\\\\) resulting from \\\\(g(t) = h(t) * y(t)\\\\) must be \\\\(H(s)Y(s)\\\\), preserving causality from the given convolution operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
