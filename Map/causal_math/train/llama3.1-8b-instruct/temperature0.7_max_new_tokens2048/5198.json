  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Lx \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the system's behavior under the Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nCan we recover the exact original function \\\\( x(0) \\\\) after evolving it under \\\\( L \\\\) and observing its Fourier transform \\\\( F(x(\\Omega)) \\\\) without knowing the details of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function from its transformed state under these conditions is highly uncertain without specific knowledge about the linear transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and the initial application of the Fourier transform. The evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) could affect various frequencies differently, complicating the back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
