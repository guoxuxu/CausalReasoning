  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subjected to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant complex number. Analyze how the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) affects z over time t, where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what transformations were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), by only knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping effects of the exponential transformations due to \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) make it challenging to disentangle and uniquely identify the applied transformations based solely on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\). The end state can likely be achieved through different combinations or magnitudes of these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
