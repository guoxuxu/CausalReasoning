  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) is used to solve the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 3\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + 2y = f(t) \\\\). The transform function is applied to both sides leading to an algebraic equation in the complex domain.\n\nIf an observer knows the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can they accurately deduce the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) under the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), assuming no initial information about \\\\( f(t) \\\\)'s specific functional form?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) would require knowledge of the initial conditions and the specific operations involved in the differential equation. Since the direct relationship between \\\\( y(t) \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) may also be influenced by initial conditions, it is not generally possible to invert \\\\( y(t) \\\\) for \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
