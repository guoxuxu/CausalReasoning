  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. An external heat source influences the system described by \\\\( h(x, t) \\\\) being added to certain regions at specific times.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is given, and the system evolves according to the heat equation without any additional heat source \\\\( h(x, t) = 0 \\\\) throughout the observation period, will the temperature distribution at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be solely determined by the initial conditions \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any external heat source, the temperature distribution at any later time is entirely determined by the heat equation relying on the initial conditions. Thermal diffusion spreads the heat according to \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and the initial distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\), without any external influence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
