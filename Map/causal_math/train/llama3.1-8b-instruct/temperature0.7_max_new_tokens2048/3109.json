  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of the transformation specified by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system, which potentially changes the trajectory even if the same differential equation governs the evolution. The output at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), depends on how matrix D interacts with M, leading to possibly differing states at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
