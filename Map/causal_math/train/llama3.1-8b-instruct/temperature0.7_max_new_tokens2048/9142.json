  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^te^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nCan the original function form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be reconstructed precisely after observing the result of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) alone, without the knowledge of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\), is insufficient to uniquely reconstruct the original function since \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is an integral that encompasses all prior states, potentially with multiple combinations leading to the same result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
