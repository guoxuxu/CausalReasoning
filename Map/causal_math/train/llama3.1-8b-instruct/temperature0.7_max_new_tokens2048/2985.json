  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) which converts function u(x, t) into its frequency components U(k, t).\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to an initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial condition and then evolving the frequency components under L does not change the physical system's properties or the linear operator's application. The inverse Fourier transform will recover the same state as evolving the original function directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
