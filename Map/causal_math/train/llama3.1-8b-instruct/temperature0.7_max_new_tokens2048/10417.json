  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(s) ds \\\\), with the kernel transformation \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-st} \\\\). We explore the impact of a modifying function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) on the system over the variable t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to an initial function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) such that \\\\( z'(0) = 0^2 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) retain the modified initial condition set by \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) modifies the initial condition but does not alter the nature of the integral transformation. Since the initial state is now squared, it influences the entire subsequent trajectory dictated by the kernel, thus maintaining the modified effect throughout the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
