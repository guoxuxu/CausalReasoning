  "Problem": "Analyze the complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, in the context of the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) with complex variable s.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) always be determined uniquely, assuming the transformation was made without other alterations?",
  "Explanation": "No, in the general case without additional constraints or information, multiple frequencies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) can result in equating the transformed outputs, especially considering complex conjugates and the nature of exponential functions in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
