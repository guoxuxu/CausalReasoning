  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t, satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's behavior using the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) and without knowledge of c, can we deduce the original initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation constant c, there is insufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Multiple different initial conditions could lead to the same transformed output under different values of c, given that their influence scales linearly through the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
