  "Problem": "Examine a complex valued function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively. Here A and B are constant matrices. We consider the impact of the integral transform \\\\(F[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F[z](s)\\\\) and assuming no additional information about prior transformations or intervention, can the original functions \\\\(x(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y(0)\\\\) be uniquely identified?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific values or additional constraints on A and B, multiple initial conditions could yield the same transformed function due to the non-uniqueness in the solutions of inverse Laplace transforms and the presence of potentially similar eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in the different systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
