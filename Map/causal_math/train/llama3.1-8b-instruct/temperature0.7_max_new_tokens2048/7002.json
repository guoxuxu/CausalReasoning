  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at some time t, is it possible to infer the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), which modifies the trajectory due to the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), the original initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from the final observation alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
