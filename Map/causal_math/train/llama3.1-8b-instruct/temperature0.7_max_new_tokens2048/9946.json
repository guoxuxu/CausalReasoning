  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system described by a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Examine the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot accurately identify if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from a direct evolution or the altered path due to integration. The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could obscure the original oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influenced by the complex exponent \\\\( s \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
