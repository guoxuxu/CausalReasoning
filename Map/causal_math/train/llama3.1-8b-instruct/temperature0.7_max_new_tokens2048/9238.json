  "Problem": "Investigate a system subjected to the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse, influencing a time-dependent function \\\\( g(t) \\\\). The function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially impacted by a transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\\\) and analyzed for causality and effects of transformations.\n\nKnowing the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at some s = a, can we reliably deduce the original form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the square transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( t^2 \\\\) alters the frequency-domain characteristics significantly. Without knowledge of the specific transformation applied, the inverse Laplace transform would not uniquely revert to the original \\\\( g(t) \\\\), but rather to the modified \\\\( t^2 g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
