  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\( z(t) \\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\) applied to this system, where \\( k \\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we accurately determine the specific interventions applied (neither, either \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) by knowing \\( z(T) \\) and assuming initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The complex interactions between \\( i \\omega \\), \\( k \\), and \\( c \\) mean that identical states \\( z(T) \\) could result from different combinations of interventions and parameters. The trajectory of \\( z(T) \\) does not uniquely determine which transformations and parameters were utilized.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
