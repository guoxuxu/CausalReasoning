  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of an electrical circuit where the resistance R(t) can change over time, and the voltage across the resistor V(t) is given by the complex function \\\\( V(t) = I(t) R(t) \\\\), where I(t) represents the current. We explore the cases under the transformation defined by multiplying the current by a complex exponential function \\\\( f(I) = e^{i\\omega t}I(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency.\n\nAfter observing the voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(I) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(I) \\\\), and given that the voltage is a product of two time-varying variables (current and resistance), which includes a phase-altered current, we cannot uniquely determine the original state of \\\\( I_0 \\\\) from \\\\( V(T) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
