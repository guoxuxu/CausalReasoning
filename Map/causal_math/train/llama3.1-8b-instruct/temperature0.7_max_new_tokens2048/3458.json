  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The function maps to the transformation with integral transformation operator \\\\( T \\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = x / (s - i\\omega) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without additional interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) are directly identifiable from the form of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), since the inverse Laplace transform operation would yield \\\\( z(t) = x e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) uniquely recovering the original function parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
