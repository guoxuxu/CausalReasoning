  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effects of modifying the system with a transformation represented by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and subsequently evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without additional intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to the scenario where \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) modifies the initial state vector, which leads to a different trajectory than if the system had evolved from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) alone. Depending on \\\\( D \\\\) and its relationship with \\\\( M \\\\), the system's trajectory can notably diverge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
