  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and \\( z \\) is subjected to the integral transformation \\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex variable \\( s \\). Analyze the effects of modifying \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) separately on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nIf the function \\( u(t) \\) is increased linearly over time without modifying \\( v(t) \\), will the transformed \\( Z(s) \\) reflect only changes in \\( u(t) \\) and not \\( v(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are independent functions contributing separately to the real and imaginary parts of \\( z(t) \\), changes in \\( u(t) \\) alone will alter the real part of \\( Z(s) \\) without affecting the imaginary part derived from \\( v(t) \\). Thus, \\( Z(s) \\) will reflect changes only due to \\( u(t) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
