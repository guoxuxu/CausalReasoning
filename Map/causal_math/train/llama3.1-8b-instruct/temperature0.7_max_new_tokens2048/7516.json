  "Problem": "Examine the effects of altering the matrix in the linear transformation \\\\(T(v) = Av\\\\) on vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a matrix. Consider the new transformation given by \\\\(f(v) = (A+D)v\\\\) after a perturbation matrix \\\\(D\\\\) is added. Assume both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(D\\\\) are constant matrices.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\(v(T)\\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations (\\\\(T(v)\\\\), \\\\(f(v)\\\\), or \\\\(g(v)\\\\)) and in what sequence were applied, solely based on the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity introduced by multiple potential interventions (\\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(E\\\\)) and their non-trivial combinations makes it challenging to backtrack the exact transformations and their sequence from the endpoint alone. Different sequences of applying these transformations could result in the same final state due to how matrix addition and multiplication can overlap in effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
