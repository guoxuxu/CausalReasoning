  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra situation where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{iwt} \\\\) is applied over time to an initial complex vector \\\\( x \\\\), and the behavior of the system is studied under the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the final state at\\\\( t = T \\\\), can we definitively determine the initial state or the specific interventions used throughout, merely by assessing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-reversible nature of the combined exponential influences and possible interplay between different frequencies and matrix transformations, reconstructing a definitive causal path from endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) backwards, including discerning specific interventions, is unfeasible. Multiple combinations or sequences of interventions could yield the same final state under non-commuting operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
