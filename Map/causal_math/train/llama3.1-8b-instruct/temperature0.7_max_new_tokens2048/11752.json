  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing an electric voltage across a resistor in a circuit, governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\). The influence of the Laplace transform, denoted by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is examined to understand the circuit's behavior over time.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 undergoes a Laplace transform and then evolves under the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the function's behavior at t = T differ from its evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) without the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform alters the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into a complex frequency domain, changing its characteristics fundamentally. When it is transformed back and allowed to evolve, the altered initial conditions due to the transform's effect will diverge from the natural evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
