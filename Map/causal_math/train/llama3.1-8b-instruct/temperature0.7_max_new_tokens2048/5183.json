  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{wt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Study the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, and T is the upper limit of integration.\n\nIf an intervention adjusts \\\\( w \\\\) to a new value mid-interval, (e.g., at T/2 where \\\\( w \\\\) becomes \\\\( w' \\\\)), will the result of \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at T capture only the initial or the final value of \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( G(z) \\\\) will reflect both the first half and the second half of the interval, incorporating the effects of both \\\\( w \\\\) and \\\\( w' \\\\). The output is a composite of both dynamics, and the result depends on the contributions from \\\\( w \\\\) up to T/2 and from \\\\( w' \\\\) from T/2 to T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
