  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt} x(t) = Ax(t) \\), where A is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of implementing a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) on x(t) and then applying an inverse Fourier transform to observe the effects on the evolution of x(t) over time.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention involving an additional function \\( g(x) = Bx(t) \\) (where B is a different constant matrix) is applied to \\( x(t) \\), will the end state \\( x(T) \\) for T > \\( t_1 \\) depend uniquely on A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\( g(x) \\) significantly alters the trajectory of the system by introducing a new dynamic component represented by the matrix B. Hence, the final state \\( x(T) \\) will depend on both matrices A and B, revealing the influence of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
