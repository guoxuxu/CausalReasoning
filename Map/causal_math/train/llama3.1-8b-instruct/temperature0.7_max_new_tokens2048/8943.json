  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a rod of length L is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation considered is applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\) (inverse Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will the final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat equation and not on the initial or intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) will depend on the sequence and type of transformations applied (both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\\\)), as well as the heat diffusion governed by the equation. These transformations influence the modal distribution and interactions, significantly affecting the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
