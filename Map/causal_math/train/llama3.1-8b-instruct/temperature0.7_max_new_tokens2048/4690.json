  "Problem": "Consider a heat transfer system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = a^2u_{xx}\\\\) (typical heat equation) in a rod, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant diffusivity property of the rod. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(x,t)) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and then solving the equation in the transform domain.\n\nGiven the transform domain solution \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without knowledge of the interval or boundary conditions used?",
  "Explanation": "While the Fourier transform can provide the solution at any time t, without specific interval or boundary conditions, multiple initial conditions can lead to the same transformed state assuming these conditions affect the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
