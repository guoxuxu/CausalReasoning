  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = z e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = ze^{Dt} \\\\) (where D is another constant) is applied as an intervention, does the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on B, C, or D?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\), along with the original transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), makes the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a result of interplay among all constants A, B, C, and D. Each of these elements influences the equation's dynamics through their respective exponential contributions, thus affecting the final complex function value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
