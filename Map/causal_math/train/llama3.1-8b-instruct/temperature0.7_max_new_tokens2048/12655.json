  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\\\) representing a complex function where \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). This function is subjected to the Laplace transform in the variable \\\\( x \\\\) resulting in \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s, y) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x,y)\\\\} + i\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(x,y)\\\\} \\\\). We study the properties of \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s, y) \\\\) under various transformations and conditions.\n\nGiven \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s, y) \\\\) after applying the differential operation and Laplace transformation, can we definitively determine the sequence of operations (derivative followed by Laplace transform) used, just by examining \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the exact operations (differential operation followed by Laplace transformation) used solely from \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s, y) \\\\) is challenging without additional data. Multiple operational sequences could lead to similar or indistinguishable results in the transform space, especially given the loss of information due to integration in the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
