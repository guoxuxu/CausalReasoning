  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\( A \\) is a fixed complex constant, and \\( z \\) represents the complex variable. This function undergoes a Laplace transform which alters its form to \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\). We analyze the effect of this transformation over different hypothetical scenarios without and with interventions.\n\nCan we determine the exact parameter \\( A \\) of the original function \\( e^{Az} \\) solely by analyzing the transformed function \\( F(s) \\) derived from the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( F(s) \\) for the function \\( e^{Az} \\) would transform to \\( \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\) (assuming the region of convergence includes \\( s = A \\)), by identifying this form in the Laplace transform, one can uniquely pinpoint the parameter \\( A \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
