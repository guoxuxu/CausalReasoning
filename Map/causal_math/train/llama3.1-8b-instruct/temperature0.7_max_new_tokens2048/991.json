  "Problem": "Examine the implications of the integral transformation \\\\( I[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\,dt \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, when a multiplier transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^m \\\\) is also applied either before or after \\\\( I[f] \\\\), with \\\\( m \\\\) also being a positive integer.\n\nIf an additional multiplier transformation \\\\( h(t) = t^p \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is a positive integer, is included at a specific time during the processing of \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\), does the final output solely depend on the application of \\\\( I[f] \\\\) and not the sequence or type of multipliers applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final output will be influenced by all transformations, including \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Each multiplier \\\\( t^m \\\\) and \\\\( t^p \\\\), depending on its order of application relative to each other and to \\\\( I[f] \\\\), contributes distinctively to the integral, determining a unique final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
