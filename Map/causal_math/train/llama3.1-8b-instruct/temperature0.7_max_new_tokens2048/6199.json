  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. To analyze causal effect and intervention, we study the system's behavior under a transformation defined by \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where M is a linear operator.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention defined by another operation \\\\( S(u) = e^{Nt}u \\\\) (where N is another linear operator) is applied, will the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 solely depend on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( S(u) \\\\) as an intervention further transforms the system state and, therefore, the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is dependent on L, M, and N. The transformations \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) can significantly influence the final state, both individually and through their interaction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
