  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers. We analyze the behavior of this function under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = g(z) + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be recovered from the transformed function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the constant \\\\( c \\\\), it's impossible to accurately reverse the transformation and recover the exact form of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) from \\\\( h(z) \\\\), as the adjustment made by \\\\( c \\\\) is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
