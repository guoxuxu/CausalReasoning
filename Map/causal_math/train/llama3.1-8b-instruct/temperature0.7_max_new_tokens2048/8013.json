  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = e^{at} + i t^b\\\\), a and b are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace transform, \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), acts on this complex function to analyze its behavior in a transformed domain.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) to transform it into the Laplace domain without any modification to the parameters a or b, will the resulting Laplace transform reflect accurate characteristics of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) in the original domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform directly translates the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) into the Laplace domain, maintaining the relationships inherent in the original function. As a linear integral transform, it preserves the characteristics of the exponential and polynomial components of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
