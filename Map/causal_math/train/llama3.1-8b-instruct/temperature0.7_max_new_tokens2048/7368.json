  "Problem": "Consider an integral equation of the form \\\\( y(x) = \\int_0^x K(x, t) y(t) dt + f(x) \\\\), where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a known function. We analyze the changes in function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) when a linear transformation \\\\( L \\\\) characterized by operator \\\\( L[y] = y + g \\\\), where \\\\( g \\\\) is an additional function, is applied to the integral equation.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine which transformations (either \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) influenced the integral equation, just by examining \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant function \\\\( y(T) \\\\) can emerge from various combinations of transformations due to the non-linear and dependent nature of the integral equation and transformations. The overlap in effects of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) on the solution's trajectory across the interval prevents unambiguous identification of specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
