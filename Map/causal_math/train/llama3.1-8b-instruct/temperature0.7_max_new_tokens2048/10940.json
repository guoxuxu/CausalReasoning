  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a square matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another square matrix.\n\nAt the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively determine whether the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( L(z) \\\\) were applied, solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations (interventions) and their parameters \\\\( N \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) could lead to the same outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the overlapping effects, especially in the non-linear interaction between the matrices. This multiplicity in possible pathways to the same endpoint makes it impossible to uniquely identify specific interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
