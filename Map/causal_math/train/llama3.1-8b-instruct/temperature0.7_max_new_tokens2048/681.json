  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a system's state in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf an initial transformation by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another constant complex matrix, is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) with no further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) provides a modified initial condition \\\\( e^{N0}z_0 \\\\) which will then evolve under \\\\( M \\\\). The evolution path is affected by \\\\( N \\\\), hence, creating a different state at time T compared to the state obtained by mere evolution under \\\\( M \\\\).",
