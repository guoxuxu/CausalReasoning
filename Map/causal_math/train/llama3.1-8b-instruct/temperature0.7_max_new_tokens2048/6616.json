  "Problem": "Consider a two-variable system described by the equations \\\\(x' = x + 2y\\\\) and \\\\(y' = -2x + y\\\\). We explore the system's behavior under linear transformations and their combinations, denoted by matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(t) & -\\\\sin(t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(t) & \\\\cos(t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\), which rotates the state vector \\\\((x, y)\\\\).\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\((x(T), y(T))\\\\) and given that transformations \\\\(M(t)\\\\) and \\\\(N(t)\\\\) might have been used at unknown times, can we confidently identify exactly when these transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint alone, particularly when both the original and its inverse transformations can be applied at arbitrary times, doesn't provide enough information to conclusively determine the timing or even the exact nature of interventions. The potential for multiple, non-discernible combinations of transformations leading to the same endpoint complicates tracing back the series of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
