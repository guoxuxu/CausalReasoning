  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), representing a rotating vector in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( w \\\\). The effect of an external transformation is considered using the operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) with \\\\( a \\\\) being a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were used (whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions from the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complicated by the multiplicative effects of the transformations which can lead to similar end states from different chains of interventions. The non-unique mapping from interventions to final states due to the exponential nature of the transformations complicates this inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
