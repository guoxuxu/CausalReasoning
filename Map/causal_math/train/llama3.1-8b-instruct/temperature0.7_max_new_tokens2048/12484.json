  "Problem": "Consider a smooth manifold M in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\) equipped with a vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\). Analyze the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T(p) = \\\\int f(p) dp\\\\) on the manifold, where \\\\(f(p)\\\\) is a smooth function.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T(p)\\\\) is applied on a point \\\\(p_0\\\\) in M and there is no further modification to the vector field or the manifold, will the flow lines of the vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\) originating at \\\\(T(p_0)\\\\) be the same as those originating at \\\\(p_0\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation modifies the initial point from \\\\(p_0\\\\) to \\\\(T(p_0)\\\\), thereby potentially changing the tangent vector at the point due to the new neighborhood conditions established by \\\\(f(p)\\\\). Hence, flow lines originating from \\\\(T(p_0)\\\\) may follow a different trajectory than those from \\\\(p_0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
