  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagating in a medium characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) represents the wave function, \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(x\\\\) is spatial coordinate, and \\\\(c\\\\) is wave speed. Let's investigate the effect of applying the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at an initial time, where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given wave equation without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for a specified T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) = u e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the initial wave function. This change in frequency content means the wave at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will exhibit different characteristics in terms of interference patterns formed by the added frequencies, leading to a state different from simply evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
