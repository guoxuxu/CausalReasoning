  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s\\\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the function at t = T, can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), only by analyzing the function at T?",
  "Explanation": "As both transformations involve integral accumulations over potentially overlapping intervals, the specific contributions of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to the final state of the function at T are not distinguishable solely based on the endpoint data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
