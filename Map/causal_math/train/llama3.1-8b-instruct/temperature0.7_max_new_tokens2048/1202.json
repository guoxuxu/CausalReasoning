  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the position of a particle, \\(s(t)\\), is influenced by a complex potential \\(U(z) = V(x) + iW(y)\\), where \\(z = x + iy\\). The movement is governed by the equation \\(\\dot{z}(t) = U'(z)\\). We assess the impact of linear transformations \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) defined by the matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}\\), and their effect over time \\(t\\).\n\nCan we infer the original position \\(z_0\\) at t = 0 after observing \\(z(T)\\) at time T, without knowing whether transformation \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) was applied, and given that \\(U'(z)\\) may non-linearly influence the dynamics, multiple possible initial states could lead to the same \\(z(T)\\). The transformation \\(\\mathbf{T}\\) might have changed \\(z_0\\) in a manner that complicates retracing without explicit knowledge of the transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
