  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where functions are transformed by Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We explore how integrating these transformations affects the plane's structures, examining the impact of tweaking the function by a constant linear shift \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) where c is a real number.\n\nBased on the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) in the final output, can we conclusively determine the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the specific interventions applied (both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) shifts and any multiplicative factors)?",
  "Explanation": "The final transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial functions and intervention types. The overlapping effects of linear and scaling transformations contribute to multiple potential pre-images, making unique identification of the original function and interventions not feasible without more specific data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
