  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and a transformation defined by the integral transform \\\\( g(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz} f(z) dz \\\\). Suppose we further investigate how other transformations like multiplication by a complex constant affect this scenario.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) on the complex plane is transformed into \\\\( g(s) \\\\) through the integral transform without any additional modifications, will the nature of singularities present in \\\\( g(s) \\\\) directly reflect the singularities of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of Laplace transform, the integral transformation will typically convert the singularities of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) into different characteristics in \\\\( g(s) \\\\). Singularities such as poles may lead to exponential decay or growth in \\\\( g(s) \\\\), but they are expressed differently due to the nature of the integral transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation of f(z) → Integral Transform; Integral Transform → g(s); Singularities of f(z) → Singularities of g(s); Transformation of f(z) → f(z) singularities; f(z) singularities → g(s) singularities"
