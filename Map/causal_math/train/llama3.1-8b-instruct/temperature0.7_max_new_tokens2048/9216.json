  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are interested in the effect of an initial Fourier transform on u(x, 0) defined by \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, 0) dx\\\\) and how it evolves under the given equation over time t.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) post-intervention with \\\\(g(u)\\\\) and the linear evolution rules, can we definitively tell if the initial condition was Fourier transformed?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear properties and potential reversibility of the Fourier transform combined with the external operation \\\\(g(u)\\\\), multiple initial conditions can converge to the same state under these transformations. Therefore, it is not possible to uniquely deduce the initial condition setup from the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
