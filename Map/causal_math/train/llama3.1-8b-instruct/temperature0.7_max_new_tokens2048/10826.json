  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( z \\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of this transformation in the context of the Laplace transform, defined as \\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we accurately deduce the original real variable \\( t \\) after observing the transform \\( F(s) \\), without knowing whether the \\( e^{iz} \\) transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\( e^{iz} \\), it is impossible to uniquely identify whether the modifications in \\( F(s) \\) are due to the natural behavior of \\( t \\) or due to the effects of the complex exponential transformation. The transform \\( F(s) \\) encapsulates both the decay and oscillatory behaviors introduced by \\( e^{iz} \\), which cannot be easily separated from the effects of \\( t \\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
