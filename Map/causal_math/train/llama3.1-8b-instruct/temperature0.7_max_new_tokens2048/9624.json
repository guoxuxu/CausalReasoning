  "Problem": "Let's explore a scenario involving a Laplace transform used to solve an initial value problem described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 \\), where p and q are constants. We investigate the behavior of the solution subject to modifications by the transform \\( T(y) = y e^{kt} \\), where k is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( y(T) \\), given that the interventions \\( T(y) \\) and \\( S(y) \\) might have been applied, can one discern precisely which interventions were indeed used based solely on the value of \\( y(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of the constants k and m (as well as possibly not applying one of the transformations at all) could result in the same final value of \\( y(T) \\). Due to the overlapping effects of the exponential terms, it's not possible to uniquely determine which interventions were used just by analyzing \\( y(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
