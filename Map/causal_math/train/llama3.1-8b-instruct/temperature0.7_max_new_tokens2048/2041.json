  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The function \\\\( g(x,t) = e^{Mt}u(x,0) \\\\), where M is a constant matrix, is used to transform the initial condition.\n\nDoes the application of \\\\( g(x,0) \\\\) to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and then evolving the system under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention result in the same \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) as evolving \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) directly to \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition by \\\\( g(x,0) \\\\) changes the state at t=0, impacting the subsequent evolution of the system. The presence of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) modifies the dynamics from the outset, potentially leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
