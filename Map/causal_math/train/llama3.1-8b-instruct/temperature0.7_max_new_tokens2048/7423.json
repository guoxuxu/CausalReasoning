  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s + a}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\), where \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) are constants. We investigate how the application of an input signal function transformed by \\\\( g(t) = e^{dt} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a constant) impacts the output over time.\n\nIf another input transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{-dt}x(t) \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the endpoint output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the characteristics of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) = e^{-dt}x(t) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying factor, meaning the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will depend on both the characteristics of the original function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the transformation factor \\\\( d \\\\). The interaction of these transformations with the transfer function leads to a final output that cannot be purely attributed to \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
