  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{ f(x) \\\\} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) e^{-i \\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\) and its inverse transform applied to a signal \\\\( f(x) \\\\). This approach is used to analyze the modifications in the signal spectrum when multiplied by a Gaussian, \\\\( g(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nCan the specific functions \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) used be uniquely determined based solely on observing the altered spectrum of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions such as \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) merely through the final spectrum is highly challenging due to potential overlaps in the spectral effects caused by different functional forms of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\). Multiple combinations of these functions could result in similar spectral modifications, thus specific identification is not feasible without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
