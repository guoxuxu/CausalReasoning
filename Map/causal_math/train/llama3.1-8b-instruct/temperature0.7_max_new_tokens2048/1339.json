  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution along a rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial heat distribution function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and a later heat source intervention represented by \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention using a new heat source \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) affecting the temperature distribution, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on the initial distribution \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and not on the intervention \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an external heat source \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\) modifies the temperature distribution directly, where the influence of the source will propagate through time. Thus, the state at time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) will depend on both the initial conditions and the characteristics and effects of the heat source intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
