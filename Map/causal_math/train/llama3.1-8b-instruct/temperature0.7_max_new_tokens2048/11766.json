  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = K \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where K is a diffusion coefficient, and \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents a temperature distribution. Investigate the effects of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = u(x,t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) a positive constant, on the system dynamics over time.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( u(x,t) + \\\\beta e^{-\\\\gamma t} \\\\) (\\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) positive constants), will the state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original diffusion coefficient K and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), or \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "This intervention modifies the basic setup by introducing an additional evolving term influenced by \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), which interacts with the existing dynamics dictated by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and K. As a result, the final state of \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) is a complex interplay of all these parameters, making it dependent on more than just the diffusion coefficient K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
