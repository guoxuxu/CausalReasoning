  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are fixed matrices. Analyze how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) as another constant matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) when applied at different stages.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the initial matrix \\\\( P \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces further modifications to the system’s evolution, making the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the original transformation \\\\( M \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( N \\\\) as well as \\\\( P \\\\). The endpoint’s state will be influenced by how these matrices interact over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
