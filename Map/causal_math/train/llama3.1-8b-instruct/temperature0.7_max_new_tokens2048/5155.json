  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(u) = e^{Su} \\\\) where S is a complex square matrix. The system evaluates the function's behavior under the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a matrix modification intervention occurs at a specific time u, changing S to a new matrix Q (where \\\\( z(u) = e^{Qu} \\\\)), does the transformed endpoint \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original matrix S?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the function to \\\\( e^{Qu} \\\\), affecting both the fundamental solve and the result of the Laplace transform. This change will cause the endpoint \\\\( Z(T) \\\\) to depend on matrix Q as well as any residual effects from matrix S if the intervention is part-way through the interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
