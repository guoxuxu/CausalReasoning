  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) over time where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\). Explore how the application of the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), affects the causality in the system's behavior.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) is computed immediately after initializing at \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and the system evolves with time under the given differential equations, will the resulting function in the s-domain differ if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) were not transformed?",
  "Explanation": "By applying the Laplace transform, the system analysis shifts from time domain to s-domain, capturing different characteristics and dependencies, including exponential decay factors not directly visible in the time trajectory. This fundamentally changes the representation and can reveal or obscure different aspects of the system's dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
