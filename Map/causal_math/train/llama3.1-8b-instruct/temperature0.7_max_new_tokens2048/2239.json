  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( R(z) = z + c \\\\) (where c is a constant complex number) is applied, will the outcome of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( R(z) \\\\) adds a complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) to the function, altering both the form and trajectory of the integral transformation onwards from \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Thus, the final state of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) reflects the influences of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), \\\\( s \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\), and not solely \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
