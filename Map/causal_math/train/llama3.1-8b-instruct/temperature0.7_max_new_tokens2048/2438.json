  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled by \\( Ax = b \\), where A is a non-singular matrix. An operator \\( T \\) defined by \\( T(x) = Ux \\) (where \\( U \\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries) is applied, modifying the vector \\( x \\) in the space.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( x(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) knowing that \\( T(x) \\) was applied, without additional details about \\( U \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the nature of the matrix \\( U \\), reconstructing the original \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible directly as the operation \\( Ux_0 \\) cannot be uniquely inverted without knowing \\( U \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
