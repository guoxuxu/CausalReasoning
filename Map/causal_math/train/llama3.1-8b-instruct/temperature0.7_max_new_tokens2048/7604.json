  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a linear transformation \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}y_0 \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) is the initial vector. We examine the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(y) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}y(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the sequence of transformations (whether none, \\\\( g(y) \\\\), \\\\( h(y) \\\\), or both) applied up to T, solely by analyzing \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) results from potentially complex interplays of exponential matrices A, B, and C, where their non-commutative nature can lead to very similar endpoints from different transformation sequences. This overlap makes it challenging to definitely distinguish among the transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
