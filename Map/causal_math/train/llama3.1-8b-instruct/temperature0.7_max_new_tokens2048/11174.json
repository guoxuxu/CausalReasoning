  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain \\\\( z \\\\) described as \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of a complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number representing rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the function application, can we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was unknown?",
  "Explanation": "The transforming effect of \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) adjusts the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and without knowledge of this transformation, especially the value of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined after the mapping by \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
