  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time. The function is transformed by a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We analyze causal inference when altering the frequency spectrum by filtering specific frequency components.\n\nGiven the end-state signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) after sequential filtration interventions, can we determine the exact order or type of filters applied (low-pass then high-pass, or high-pass only), solely from observing \\\\( z''(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end-state signal \\\\( z''(t) \\\\) may mirror effects compatible with different filter sequences due to overlapping alterations in frequency components. Without explicit information about the filters' characteristics and order, multiple configurations could potentially yield similar resulting time-domain signals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
