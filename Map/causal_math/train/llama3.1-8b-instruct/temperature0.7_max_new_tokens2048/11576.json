  "Problem": "Analyze the feedback system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another constant matrix, applied at specific instances.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint the exact nature of interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both), by only observing the state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity in potential state transformations by \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) prevents a clear deduction of intervention applications. Different combinations of \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), even in varying sequences, could theoretically lead to the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), thereby obscuring the exact causal path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
