  "Problem": "Analyze a system given by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\), and consider the effect of applying a boundary condition transformation represented by \\\\( u = h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\), where \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is a harmonic function.\n\nIf the boundary condition \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is specified on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) without any further intervention, will the solution inside \\\\( D \\\\) at a later time T be determined solely by \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution of the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in domain \\\\( D \\\\) under given boundary conditions is uniquely determined by those boundary conditions. With the uniqueness theorem in harmonic functions, specifying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) sets the solution throughout the domain uniquely for all time as the system is time-invariant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
