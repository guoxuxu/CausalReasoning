  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{kz} \\\\), where k is a complex constant. We examine the implications of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(w) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(z) e^{-iwz} dz \\\\), where w is a real constant representing frequency.\n\nGiven the transformed function after applying both \\\\( H(w) \\\\) and \\\\( D(w) \\\\), is it feasible to trace back and unequivocally determine the presence and specific form of \\\\( D(w) \\\\), using only the modified H(w)?",
  "Explanation": "Since differential operations on the frequency domain spread or modify the spectral content, and due to potential overlaps or shifts in frequency as well as losses of original information, it is generally challenging, if not impossible, to precisely infer the type and characteristics of \\\\( D(w) \\\\) applied prior to or during the transformation without additional detailed information on the operational context or initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
