  "Problem": "Consider the application of complex function mapping \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{z} \\\\) in the complex plane and its implications on the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\) defined for \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\\\). The Laplace transform is given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = f(t)e^{-t} \\\\) at some \\\\( t_0 > 0 \\\\), and we then compute the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will this outcome depend only on the new function and not on the transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w = e^{s} \\\\) does not influence the computation of the Laplace transform of the new function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), which solely relies on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) itself. The intervention modifies the function, but the calculation of its Laplace transform remains a separate process uninfluenced by the complex mapping.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
