  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario with the integral operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) defined by the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{st} \\\\). An external intervention uses the Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), to modify the function before its evolution.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) evolves without additional transforms, and then the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is applied, will the resulting transform be the same as if \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was first Fourier transformed and then evolved?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence and type of transformations matter. The Fourier and Laplace transforms have different operational domains and focus, affecting the transformed results differently. Evolution using one transform followed by another changes the characteristics substantially, compared to evolution under one transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
