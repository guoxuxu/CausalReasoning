  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x,0) \\\\) is applied to a state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x,0) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Kx_0 \\\\). Since the system's evolution depends on the initial conditions set by the differential operator L, the presence of K alters the trajectory from what it would have been under the unmodified conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
