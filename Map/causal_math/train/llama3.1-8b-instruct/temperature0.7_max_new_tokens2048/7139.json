  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a time-dependent function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\). We explore the behavior of this transformation under different conditions and study the causal inference between the input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) and its transformed counterpart \\\\(F(s)\\\\).\n\nIf a modification to \\\\(f(t)\\\\) occurs at a specific time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), introducing a delta function, and then \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed to \\\\(F(s)\\\\), will the presence of the delta function alter \\\\(F(s)\\\\) distinctly regardless of the original form of \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t - t_0) \\\\) uniquely influences \\\\(F(s)\\\\) by adding an additional exponential term \\\\( e^{-st_0} \\\\) to the Laplace transform. This alteration is recognizable and independent of the original form of \\\\(f(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
