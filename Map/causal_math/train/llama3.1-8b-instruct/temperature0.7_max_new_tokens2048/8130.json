  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) representing a complex valued function, where \\\\( z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\\\). We analyze the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) to \\\\( h(z) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{ h(z) \\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) also belongs to the complex plane.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) with poles at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\), can we conclude that the original function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was purely sinusoidal?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of poles at \\\\( s = i\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( H(s) \\\\) suggests a sinusoidal component in \\\\( h(z) \\\\), but does not exclude the possibility of additional components such as damping factors or other sinusoids with different frequencies. The Laplace transform can represent a combination of effects, not just a single sinusoidal function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Laplace transform → Having H(s) with poles at s = iω; H(s) with poles at s = iω → Having h(z) with a sinusoidal component"
