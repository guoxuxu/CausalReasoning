  "Problem": "Consider a sequence of integral transformations on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-tx} f(x) dx \\\\), followed by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\). We examine the effects and causal sequences related to combining and modifying these transformations.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and subsequently to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) without any intermediate manipulation, will the resulting function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) be equivalent to applying a combined transformation directly from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) using a single integral?",
  "Explanation": "Sequential application of the transformations from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is commutative as these transformations involve linear operations (integrations). Therefore, transforming directly from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( h(x) \\\\) using the equivalent single integral transformation yields the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
