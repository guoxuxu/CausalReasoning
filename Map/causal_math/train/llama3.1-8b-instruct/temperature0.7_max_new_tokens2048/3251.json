  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nIf an intervention, defined by applying a filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\) in the frequency domain, is used at some t = t_1, will the final state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(T,x)]\\\\) for T > t_1 still mimic the unfiltered system's behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new element, the filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\), which modifies the frequency components of the solution. This alteration affects the subsequent evolution, making the state at time T dependent on the nature of the filter applied, thus diverging from the trajectory of the original unfiltered system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
