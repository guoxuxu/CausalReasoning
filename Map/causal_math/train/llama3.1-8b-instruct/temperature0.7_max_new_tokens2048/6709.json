  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a transformation given by \\\\( g(u) = (Tf)(u) \\\\), where \\\\( Tf \\\\) represents a Fourier transform over a function f modifying u.\n\nIf \\\\( g(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(u) \\\\) as an initial transformation modifies the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( u_0 \\\\), potentially altering not just the initial condition but potentially also how u behaves under the operator L, due to changes in frequency components, especially if L impacts these components differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
