  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ x(t) \\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its response to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) expressed by \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The system’s impulse response is \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} \\\\), relating the input and output through \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a filtering process \\\\( f(t) \\\\) characterized by \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is applied to modify \\\\( u(t) \\\\) before entering the system, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) reflect only the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) without considering \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by a filter \\\\( f(t) \\\\), which alters \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) * f(t) \\\\) (where '*' denotes convolution), results in a modified input \\\\( U'(s) = U(s)F(s) \\\\). Consequently, the output \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U'(s) \\\\) now reflects the properties of all three components \\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( U(s) \\\\), and \\\\( F(s) \\\\), indicating that \\\\( F(s) \\\\) cannot be disregarded.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
