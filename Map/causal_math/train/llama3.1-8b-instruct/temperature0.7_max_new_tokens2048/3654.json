  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dz}{dt} + qz \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are constants. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), on this function over time.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the s-domain at some point, can we precisely infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing the operational details of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the parameters \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) in the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Multiple differential equations with different parameters can result in the same or similar transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
