  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) over time where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\). Explore how the application of the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), affects the causality in the system's behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the parameters A and B at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to A' and B', and then the system is observed until time T, will the final Laplace transform \\\\( L[z(T)] \\\\) reveal only the effects of the original parameters A, B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention directly alters the system's dynamics, thus affecting both the evolution and the final s-domain representation. These changes due to A' and B' significantly affect the output, conflicting or compounding over existing effects from A and B, hence the final transform will encapsulate the amalgamation of both parameter sets' influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
