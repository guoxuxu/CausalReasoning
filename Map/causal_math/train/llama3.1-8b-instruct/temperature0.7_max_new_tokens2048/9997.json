  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a complex constant. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state, changing the system's trajectory. The transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can fundamentally alter the dynamics, depending on the nature of D relative to C, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
