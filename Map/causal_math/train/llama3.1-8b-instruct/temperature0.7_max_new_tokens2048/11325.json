  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves in the complex plane under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We study how the Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), affects our understanding of the system.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially starts as \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without any interventions, will the Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t reflect changes due solely to the natural evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) under its differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), being a linear integral transform, directly captures how the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolve. Since \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the transformation captures this evolution without alteration, reflecting changes due to the differential equation alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
