  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( T \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t = T \\\\) follow the original trajectory defined by \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the initial value of the function, altering the trajectory. Since \\\\( T \\\\) affects both the magnitude and the phase of the output, the resulting function will not simply be \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) but rather \\\\( a e^{i\\omega t} + b \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
