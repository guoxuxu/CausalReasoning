  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\), \\\\( y \\\\) are constant vectors. This function models the summative effects of two evolving systems on a complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we conclusively determine the initial vector \\\\( y \\\\) without knowing the initial state of \\\\( x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) contribute to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through their respective exponential functions. Without isolating the effect of \\\\( x \\\\), one can't accurately trace back only from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( y \\\\) due to this intertwined contribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
