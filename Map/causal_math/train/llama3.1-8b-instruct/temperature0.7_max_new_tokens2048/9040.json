  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and type of intervention (the application of \\\\( C \\\\)), can we confidently trace back to initial vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) without ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Despite knowing the intervention, the specific influence of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) combined with the complexity introduced by matrix \\\\( C \\\\) results in a system state that can originate from several possible initial combinations of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). Multiple initial scenarios can produce the same end state under such nonlinear transformations, particularly because the influence of \\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( A \\\\), and \\\\( B \\\\) might not be separable in a unique manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
