  "Problem": "Consider the laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a differentiable function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of introducing a derivative operation into the transform defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf given the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we reconstruct the exact initial time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without first applying the derivative operation?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform, when applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\), recovers the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) regardless of derivative operations, presuming no transformations modifying or loss of information about initial conditions in the transform domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
