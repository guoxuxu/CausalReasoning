  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) on a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. Consider the Laplace transform definition \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at some \\\\( s = b \\\\), can one uniquely determine the original constant \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), the original constant \\\\( a \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the transform as it is the point where the function has a pole. No additional transformation or information is needed to deduce \\\\( a \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
