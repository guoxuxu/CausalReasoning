  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where t is a real-valued parameter. We explore different transformations including the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), we modify \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{2it} \\) and then apply the Laplace Transform, will the outcome \\( L(z)(s) \\) at s=i be dependent only on the modified function and not on initial \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification to \\( e^{2it} \\) affects the integral, resulting in a fundamentally different Laplace transform. Since \\( L(z)(s) \\) integrates over all t from 0 to infinity, it combines effects from both the initial and modified functions unless the change happens precisely at \\( t = 0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
