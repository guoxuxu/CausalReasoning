  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(x, t) = xe^{At} \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We evaluate the results of incorporating an operational matrix, \\\\( P(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant scalar, impacting the function over time t.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\) as \\\\( xe^{AT} \\\\), can we definitively determine whether the transformation \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( P(0) \\\\) equals the identity matrix, observing the value of \\\\( z(x, T) \\\\) as \\\\( xe^{AT} \\\\) does not provide information about whether \\\\( P(t) \\\\) was initially applied. The resulting state at T would be the same either way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
