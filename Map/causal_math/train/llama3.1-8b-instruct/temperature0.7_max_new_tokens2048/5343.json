  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x\\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is an initial vector. We study the implications of applying an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\\\) at some point in time t, where E is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention through a new function \\\\( i(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) after \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t=0, does the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_2 depend only on the matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "The final state depends not only on matrix D but also on the matrices E and F due to the sequential transformations effecting the system's dynamics. The intervention of \\\\( i(z) \\\\) further complicates the dependency, making the final state a function of all three matrices and their interplay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
