  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at time t, transforming the system's state.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) squares the initial state, significantly altering the trajectory of the system. When squaring the state, the trajectory evolves from a new initial state \\\\( z^2_0 \\\\) under the dynamics defined by \\\\( A \\\\), leading to a state at time T that differs from that of an unsquared \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
