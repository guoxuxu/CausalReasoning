  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + xu_x = 0 \\), where \\( u(t, x) \\) is a function of time \\( t \\) and space \\( x \\). Investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(t, \\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\xi x}u(t, x)dx \\) on the system over time.\n\nIf a transformation \\( \\hat{v}(t, \\xi) = e^{i\\xi^2t}\\hat{u}(t, \\xi) \\) is applied at some point \\( t_1 \\), will the behavior of \\( \\hat{u}(T, \\xi) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) accurately reflect the initial characteristics dictated by \\( u(0, x) \\) solely under its inherent dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( e^{i\\xi^2t} \\) alters the propagation characteristics significantly by introducing new dynamics in \\( \\xi \\)-space, making the final state a product of both the inherent dynamics and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
