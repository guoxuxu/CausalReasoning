  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a continuous time Fourier transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant, and its interaction with the Laplace transform of the same function. Let \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and let \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) be the Fourier transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the forms of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) uniquely without knowing whether it was subjected to a Fourier transform or a Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the type of transformation (Fourier or Laplace) applied, and considering that many different functions can yield similar transformed results in different domains, it is not feasible to uniquely backtrack to the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
