  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We explore the effects of applying the Laplace Transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), on this function and analyzing its impact on the system's dynamics.\n\nDoes the application of the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further transformation keep the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) discernible in the transform domain?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s > 0 \\\\). This transformation preserves the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the transform domain, represented by the imaginary part of the pole in the resulting function.",
