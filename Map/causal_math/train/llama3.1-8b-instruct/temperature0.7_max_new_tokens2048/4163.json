  "Problem": "Considering a controlled experiment involving the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a system of differential equations with matrices M and N respectively: \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\). The experiment examines the impact of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iKt}z \\\\), where K is a constant scalar, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) (where J is a constant scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and N and not on K or J?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, producing additional rotational distortions driven by J, thus making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend on J as well as K, in addition to the impacts of M and N. These effects contribute cumulatively, altering the originally expected evolution of \\\\( z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
