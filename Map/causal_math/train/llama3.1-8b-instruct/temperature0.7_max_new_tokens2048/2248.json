  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x(t) \\) acting on a complex function \\( x(t) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. We examine the consequences of applying an Integral transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t) \\, dt \\) over time t.\n\nGiven the final transformed output \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\), can we determine precisely what transformations (whether \\( z(t) \\), \\( u(t) \\), or both) were used, only by examining \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) at time t > \\( t_1 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linearity and superposition in the Laplace Transform and the complex exponentials, multiple combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\eta \\) could yield similar transformations on \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\). The final output does not retain distinct markers of individual transformations, thus we cannot uniquely specify the interventions only from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
