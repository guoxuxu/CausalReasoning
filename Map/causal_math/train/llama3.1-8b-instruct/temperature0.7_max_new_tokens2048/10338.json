  "Problem": "Assume a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolves over time t governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az\\\\), with A being a complex constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the initial point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's challenging to backtrack the initial conditions accurately as \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) might have significantly transformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in ways that cannot be simply reversed, especially if the relationship between A and B leads to non-trivial interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
