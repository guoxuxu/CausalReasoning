  "Problem": "Evaluate the stability and causal inference of the system governed by the linear partial differential equation given by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We consider the influence of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\)\n\nIf an intervening function transform, say a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(s,t) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x,t)\\\\}\\\\), is applied at time t = t1 > 0, will the final Fourier transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) be dependent only on L?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a Laplace transform at time t1 adds another layer of transformation, making the final state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,T)\\\\) dependent on both the differential operator L and the effects of the Laplace transform, which alters the evolution and final state in the transform space differently than L alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
