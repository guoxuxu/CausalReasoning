  "Problem": "We examine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a complex constant. We then explore the alteration effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix, on the evolution of z.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a further transformation \\\\( k(z) = Rz \\\\) (where R is a constant complex matrix) is intervened, is the final position of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) exclusively dependent upon P and not influenced by Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) combined with the previous transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) means that the behavior of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) relies on all transformations: Q, R, as well as the original rule ∙z = Pz. The transformative effects of Q and R can alter the system's trajectory and thereby the final result at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
