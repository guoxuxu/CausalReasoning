  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nCan we determine the original time-domain signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and observing its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied, the changed frequency spectrum observed through \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) will not directly indicate the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). The frequency shift introduced by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obscures the original characteristics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), making it impossible to deduce without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
