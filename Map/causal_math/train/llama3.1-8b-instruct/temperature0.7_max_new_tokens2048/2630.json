  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit in which the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) over time t is driven by a complex function of voltage \\\\( V(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the radian frequency. We explore how applying a Laplace transform to the voltage affects the current's behavior and the system's response.\n\nCan we infer the original voltage waveform \\\\( V(t) \\\\) accurately after observing the transformed current \\\\( \\hat{I}(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain, assuming no knowledge of initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( V(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\hat{I}(s) \\\\)requires knowledge of the entire system’s characteristics including initial conditions and circuit parameters such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance. Without this information, the original voltage waveform cannot be precisely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
