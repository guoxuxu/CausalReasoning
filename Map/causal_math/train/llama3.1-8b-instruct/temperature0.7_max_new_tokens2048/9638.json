  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined over complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz} dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( g(f(z)) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\( g(f(z)) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2} \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the squaring function loses information about the sign, and the characteristic \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) produces the same result for \\\\( +z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( -z_0 \\\\). Moreover, there could be ambiguity regarding whether transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
