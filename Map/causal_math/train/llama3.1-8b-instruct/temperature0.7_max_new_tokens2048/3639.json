  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle moving along a line is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = kx \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant coefficient. We examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) operated on the initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and its impact over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), with \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\) alters the trajectory initiated by \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The state at any later time, including \\\\( T \\\\), will reflect both the initial and the intervened transformations. Hence, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( h(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
