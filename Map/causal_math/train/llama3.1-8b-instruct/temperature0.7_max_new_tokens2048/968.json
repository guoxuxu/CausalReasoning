  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial complex amplitude and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore causal relations incorporating the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) being a complex constant and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) a frequency.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, based on the characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The complex exponential interactions of the transformations introduce multiple potential trajectories that could yield the same final state. Without precise knowledge of the parameters \\\\( c, \\delta, d, \\\\) and \\\\( \\eta \\\\) or additional information, it is not feasible to definitively ascertain which transformations were applied merely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
