  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. A linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + \\\\alpha z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant. We investigate how \\\\( L \\\\) affects the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the initial function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) at t = 0, and evolved naturally under the operator \\\\( L \\\\), will \\\\( Lz(t) \\\\) at t = T be different if \\\\( L \\\\) was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) changes the fundamental behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Specifically, since \\\\( Lz = i\\\\omega e^{i\\\\omega t} + \\\\alpha e^{i\\\\omega t} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\alpha) e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), the addition of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) modifies the amplitude and phase, resulting in a different function from the natural evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
