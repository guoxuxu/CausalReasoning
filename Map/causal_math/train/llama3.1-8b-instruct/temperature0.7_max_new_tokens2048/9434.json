  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the impact of a transformation using Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier transform at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether a transformation was applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under suitable conditions (assuming appropriate decay or integrability conditions on \\\\( z(t) \\\\)). Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform can be used to reconstruct \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) from its transformed state at any later time \\\\( t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → z(t); D → z(t); z(t) → Fourier transform; t = 0 → transformation applied; transformation applied → D; T → Fourier transform; z(t) → F(z)"
