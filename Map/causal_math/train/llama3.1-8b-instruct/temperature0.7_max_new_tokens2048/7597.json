  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), where \\\\( A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) representing a rotation by an angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) on the complex plane.\n\nIf \\\\( A \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve naturally under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at later times t > 0 remain a circle centered at the origin on the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The application of matrix \\\\( A \\\\) at the initial stage is a rotation, which preserves the magnitude of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Since \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) describes a circle on the complex plane, rotating this circle by any angle \\\\( \\phi \\\\) still results in a circle centered at the origin.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
