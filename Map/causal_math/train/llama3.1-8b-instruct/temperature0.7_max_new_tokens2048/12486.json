  "Problem": "Consider a smooth manifold M in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\) equipped with a vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\). Analyze the implications of applying an integral transformation \\\\(T(p) = \\\\int f(p) dp\\\\) on the manifold, where \\\\(f(p)\\\\) is a smooth function.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\(G(p) = \\\\int g(p) dp\\\\), where \\\\(g(p)\\\\) is another smooth function, is applied at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will this intervention solely affect the flow lines based on the vector field \\\\(X(p)\\\\) without influence from the initial transformation \\\\(T(p)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(G(p)\\\\) introduces another layer of transformation, affecting the current trajectories including the history of transformations. The endpoint's flow lines will be affected by both \\\\(f(p)\\\\) and \\\\(g(p)\\\\), not exclusively by the vector field properties defined by \\\\(X(p)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
