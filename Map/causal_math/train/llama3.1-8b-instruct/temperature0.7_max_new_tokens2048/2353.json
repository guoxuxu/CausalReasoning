  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = g(x, t) = e^{Mt}x \\\\) where M is a constant matrix and x is a complex variable. We examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) in analyzing the system for various conditions.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to a function \\\\( g(x, 0) = x \\\\) at t = 0 and then the result is allowed to evolve based on the transformation without further manipulation, will the inverse Laplace transform of Z(s) at t = T equal the function \\\\( g(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform linearly captures the evolution of the function \\\\( z = e^{Mt}x \\\\), and thus directly applying the inverse Laplace transform on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will correctly revert to the function state \\\\( g(x, T) = e^{MT}x \\\\) at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
