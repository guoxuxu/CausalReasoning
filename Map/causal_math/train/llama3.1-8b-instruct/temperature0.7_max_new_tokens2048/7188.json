  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the solution to the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\), and K is a constant matrix. Explore the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at various times, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to accurately determine which transformations (\\\\( h(w) \\\\), \\\\( j(w) \\\\), or both) were applied, based only on the observed outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging because multiple, non-unique routes can lead to the same outcome. This is due to the complex interactions and potential equivalence of effects via different combinations of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), thereby obscuring the exact trajectory and interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
