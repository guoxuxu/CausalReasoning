  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex domain. We assess the effect of applying a Laplace Transform, indicated by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to a transformed function \\\\( g(t) = f(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function that had an intervention (known to involve a polynomial multiplication), can we specifically deduce the nature of the multiplication (such as \\\\( t^2 \\\\)) and recover the original \\\\( f(t) = e^{it} \\\\) only from the transform at T?",
  "Explanation": "Although some characteristics of the original function can be hypothesized from the transform's behavior, the exact nature of the polynomial intervention cannot be uniquely determined from the Laplace Transform alone due to possible variations in initial function modifications leading to similar transform characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace Transform → Intervention; Intervention → Polynomial Multiplication; Polynomial Multiplication → g(t); g(t) → f(t); f(t) → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → f(t); Polynomial Multiplication → Type of Polynomial (e.g., t^2)"
