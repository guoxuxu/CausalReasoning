  "Problem": "Examine a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant. The transformation considered is through the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition.\n\nGiven knowledge of the final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) only, can we accurately determine the specifics of transformations (either just \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), just \\\\(\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\), or both) applied at any time?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) after applying multiple transformations presents a superposition or mixed effects that cannot disaggregate the influence of individual transformations without more information on the intermediate states or exact transformation specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
