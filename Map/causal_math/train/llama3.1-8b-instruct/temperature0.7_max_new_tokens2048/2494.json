  "Problem": "Consider a physical system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a region R. An external force is modelled by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) that modifies the boundary conditions of R at time t = 0. We analyze the effect of this initial condition and subsequent interventions on the solution u(x, y, t) across the domain.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the initial boundary condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) from the solution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at a later time T, without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace equation is deterministic and the solution in a well-defined domain with known boundary behaviors is uniquely determined by its initial conditions, one can infer \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at any time T with the correct inverse problem approach.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
