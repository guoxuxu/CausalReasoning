  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of a real variable, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform to this signal, represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we unambiguously determine the presence and exact form of any window function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) used during the transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by examining \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F(s) \\\\), after applying a window function, is a convolution that blends the characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). Disentangling them from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) alone generally requires additional information about one of the functions to reverse the convolution effect unambiguously.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
