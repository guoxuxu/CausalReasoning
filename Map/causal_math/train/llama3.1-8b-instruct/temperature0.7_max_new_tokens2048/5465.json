  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace Transform of this function is used to analyze its behavior in the complex frequency domain, represented as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the real part function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) + a \\\\) for some constant \\\\( a \\\\), and allowed to evolve under its natural properties without further intervention, will the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some point s be unaffected?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( u'(t) = u(t) + a \\\\) introduces an extra term in the Laplace Transform, specifically \\\\( a/s \\\\). This change affects the overall Laplace transform, thus modifying the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
