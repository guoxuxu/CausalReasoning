  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) governing a field \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) across space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = L u\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. We analyze the behavior of the field under the transformation \\\\(v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)]\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) involves applying an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(T[u(x,0)]\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\), and the field is evolved under the PDE without further intervention, will \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) match the solution if the initial condition was not transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T[u(x,0)]\\\\) changes the initial state of the field, which in turn alters how the field evolves under the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\). The solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) will be different due to the modified initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
