  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the input was the original \\\\(V(t)\\\\) or its transformed version without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The observed current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) alone does not provide enough information to unambiguously determine if the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was applied. Both the original and the transformed voltage sources could potentially lead to the same current due to the linearity and time-invariance of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
