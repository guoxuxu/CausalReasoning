  "Problem": "Let's consider the linear functional transformation \\\\( F(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a fixed but unknown function. We explore the consequences of applying \\\\( F(g) \\\\) to different functions \\\\( g(t) \\\\) under continuous and piecewise mappings.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\) is introduced at some time as intervention, changing \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + h(t) \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( F(g) \\\\) reflect changes determined only by the initial form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + h(t) \\\\) and consequently, \\\\( F(g(t) + h(t)) \\\\) involves interactions of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\). This alters the output, making it dependent on the original form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and the new altered function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
