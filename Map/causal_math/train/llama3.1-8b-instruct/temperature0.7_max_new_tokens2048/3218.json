  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the continuous mapping of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where a is a real constant, and z represents a complex variable. This function is then subjected to a transformation via a linear operator T that acts as an integral transformation, defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\int_{c-i\\infty}^{c+i\\infty} e^{st} f(1-s) ds \\\\), where c and s are complex variables and t is a real parameter.\n\nIs it possible to exactly retrieve the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at z = 0 purely by observing the output of T at t = T without prior knowledge of the transformation executed by T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation by T involves complex exponential components that can significantly modify the original function, making it infeasible to reverse engineer to the original function without explicit knowledge of the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
