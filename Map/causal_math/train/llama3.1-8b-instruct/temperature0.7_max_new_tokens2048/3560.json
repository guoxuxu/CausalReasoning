  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\( z \\) is governed by the complex function \\( z = h(x) \\) and \\( x \\) evolves over time as defined by a linear differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a constant matrix. We study the effects of a Laplace transform \\( L \\) on the function \\( h(x) \\), specifically \\( L\\{h(x)\\} \\) over the integral transformation.\n\nKnowing the outcome \\( L\\{z(T)\\} \\), can we determine what interventions (such as changes in \\( x \\) or applications of \\( L \\)) were applied at any time before T?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different interventions or sequences of interventions could lead to the same \\( L\\{z(T)\\} \\), as the Laplace transform might mask the specific impacts of changes in \\( x \\) and the initial applications. This non-uniqueness and the broad influence of the Laplace space make it difficult to pinpoint interventions just from final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
