  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is also a constant, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Rt}z_0 \\\\), which changes the initial conditions of the differential equation. As the function evolves, the evolution encompasses the influence of R, resulting in a trajectory that differs from one that starts directly from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the original equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
