  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(\\\\xi) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0(x)) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and the system evolves under the given PDE without further intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) be equivalent to the state resulting from evolving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) directly under the PDE?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is a linear operation, and the PDE is linear, the transformed initial condition \\\\( \\\\hat{u}_0(\\\\xi) \\\\) when evolved will yield \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\), the Fourier transform of the directly evolved \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\). Inverse Fourier transforming \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) returns \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), showing that the transformed and directly evolved states are equivalent.",
