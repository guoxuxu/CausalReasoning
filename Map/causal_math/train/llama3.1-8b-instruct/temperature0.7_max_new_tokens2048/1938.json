  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent function and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The Laplace transform is modified by a multiplying operator \\\\( M(s) \\\\) resulting in a transformed function \\\\( G(s) = M(s)F(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we retrieve the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) without knowing the operator \\\\( M(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( M(s) \\\\), the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered from \\\\( G(s) = M(s)F(s) \\\\) because different \\\\( M(s) \\\\) could lead to the same \\\\( G(s) \\\\) for different \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The inversion requires knowledge of \\\\( M(s) \\\\) to correctly adjust the transformed function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
