  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a time-varying admittance matrix \\\\( Y(t) \\\\), and a network described by the voltage-current relationship \\\\( I = Y(t)V \\\\). We examine the impact of a transformation represented by the matrix function \\\\( P(t) = e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, that affects the voltage vector over time.\n\nGiven the final current vector \\\\( I(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations were applied (either \\\\( P(t) \\\\), \\\\( S(t) \\\\), or both) only by knowing the magnitude of \\\\( I(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final magnitude of \\\\( I(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations and sequences of the transformations represented by matrices Q and R, due to the complex interaction of these exponential matrices with the admittance matrix Y(t). The non-exclusive nature of their effects and lack of traceability in the transformations precludes precise identification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
