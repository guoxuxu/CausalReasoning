  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem where the velocity field \\\\( v(x, y, t) \\\\) evolves over time according to a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} + (v \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)v = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 v \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) is the pressure and \\\\( \\\\nu \\\\) is the viscosity. We study the behavior of the velocity field under an integral transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(v) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform.\n\nCan we deduce the initial velocity field \\\\( v_0(x, y) \\\\) directly by observing the velocity field \\\\( v(x, y, T) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( F(v) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the Laplace transform was initially applied, you cannot accurately revert to the initial state \\\\( v_0(x, y) \\\\). The transformation could have significantly altered the frequency composition and phase properties of the field, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( v_0 \\\\) from \\\\( v(x, y, T) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
