  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\) be a transfer function of a linear time-invariant system, where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. Suppose an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) through this system. We examine the effect of input transformations using a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse on the resulting output.\n\nConsidering an output \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we determine the exact form of the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that produced it, without knowing whether an exponential transformation was applied to the input?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( x'(t) = x(t)e^{ct} \\\\) changes the corresponding Laplace transform of the input, multiple forms of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) could produce the same \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depending on whether and how the input was exponentially scaled. Without this knowledge, uniquely determining \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is not feasible, given the infinite possibilities of \\\\( c \\\\).",
