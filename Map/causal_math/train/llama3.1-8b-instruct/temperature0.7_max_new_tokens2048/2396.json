  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We investigate the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\) on the function over time t.\n\nGiven the final result of the Fourier transformation, can we pinpoint exactly which transformations or interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both) solely from the result?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used, solely from the Fourier transform result, is complex due to the overlapping and additive nature of frequency components introduced by interventions like \\\\( G(z) \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) could yield similar transformed results, obscuring the precise transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Angular frequency ω → Function z(t); Fourier transformation F(z) → Result of Fourier transformation; z(t) → Fourier transformation F(z); F(z) → Result of Fourier transformation; Result of Fourier transformation → Used transformation F(z) or G(z)"
