  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\\\\\((z) = ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\) applied to a complex number \\\\\\\\((z = x + yi\\\\\\\\), where \\\\\\\\((x\\\\\\\\) and \\\\\\\\((y\\\\\\\\) are constants and \\\\\\\\((t\\\\\\\\) represents time. The system's behavior is analyzed under an integral transformation \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\), defined as \\\\\\\\((Tf(z) = \\\\int_0^1 f(zu) du\\\\\\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\\\\\((Tf(z)\\\\\\\\) at t = T, can we derive \\\\\\\\((z\\\\\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing how \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\) was initially applied to \\\\\\\\((ze^{zt}\\\\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the transformation under \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\) and its integral nature, extracting \\\\\\\\((z\\\\\\\\) or determining the function form at t = 0 from \\\\\\\\((Tf(z)\\\\\\\\) at t = T requires more information about the original function form and the characteristics of \\\\\\\\((T\\\\\\\\), including the impact of variable scaling and integration bounds.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
