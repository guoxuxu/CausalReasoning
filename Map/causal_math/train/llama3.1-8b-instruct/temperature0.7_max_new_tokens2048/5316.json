  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the Laplace transform of its input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\), giving \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\. The output of the system is described by the function \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is the system's transfer function. We examine the effects of modifying the input signal using the transformation \\\\( g(x) = x(t) * e^{-at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing only the value of the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) post-intervention, is it possible to specify exactly which transformations or interventions (\\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( H(s) \\\\) modifications, or both) occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multiplicative and modificative effects of the transfer function alterations and the exponential transformation, various combinations of \\\\( K(s) \\\\), \\\\( a \\\\), and baseline \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( Y(s) \\\\). Therefore, without additional data, it's impossible to precisely determine the interventions from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
