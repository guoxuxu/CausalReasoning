  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform operation on a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how it interacts with a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\( u \\\\) is an external input. The causal inference is about the effect of changes in \\\\( u \\\\) through a time-dependent control function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), which is applied before taking the Laplace Transform.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can we infer that the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( u \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) combines the effects of \\\\( D \\\\) and transformed \\\\( u(t) \\\\), but this transformation alone does not allow back-calculating to understand whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied specifically, due to potential similar transformations by different combinations of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
