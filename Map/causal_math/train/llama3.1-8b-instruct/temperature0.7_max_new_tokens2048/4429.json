  "Problem": "Assess the role of the Laplace transform in a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\), where D is a diffusion constant. Analyze the outcomes when the function \\( h(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha} \\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as a Laplace transform modifier at initial and various times.\n\nIf the Laplace transform modified by \\( h(s) \\\\) is applied to \\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\) without further intervention, will \\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T once transformed back be identical to directly solving the initial differential equation to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\( h(s) \\) alters the Laplace space representation of the initial condition, affecting the entire time evolution of \\( u \\). This transformation adds an exponential decay factor \\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\) to the solution, leading to discrepancies from the unmodified scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
