  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) at time t = T, can we recover the initial condition \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0,x)]\\\\) without knowing any specific details about the spatial evolution or initial spatial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution equation in the frequency domain following the Fourier transformation remains linear and reversible for this unidirectional wave equation. The inverse Fourier transform applied to \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t,x)]\\\\) adequately recovers \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(0,x)]\\\\), since the effect of time evolution under linear translation is known and invertible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "time t → u(t,x); spatial position x → u(t,x); constant a → u(t,x); Fourier transform → spatial frequency; spatial position x → spatial frequency; u(t,x) → u(t,x) in Fourier space; u(t,x) in Fourier space → u(t,x) in Fourier space at t = T; u(t,x) in Fourier space at t = T → u(0,x) in Fourier space"
