  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The function is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = p(t) \\\\cdot z' + q(t) \\\\cdot z \\\\) where \\\\( ' \\\\) denotes the derivative with respect to t, and \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) are time-varying coefficients.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) at some time T, can we retrieve \\\\( z(0) \\\\) directly without knowing the forms of \\\\( p(t) \\\\), \\\\( q(t) \\\\), and \\\\( r(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) is infeasible without additional information about the coefficients \\\\( p(t) \\\\), \\\\( q(t) \\\\), and \\\\( r(t) \\\\). These functions shape the modified dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) under \\\\( L \\\\), and their unknown variations can lead to multiple possible initial conditions that could have resulted in the observed \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
