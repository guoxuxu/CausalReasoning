  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) given by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\) with a boundary condition u(0) = 0. Analyze its behavior under the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf observing \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) at t = T, can we reconstruct the exact form of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = u(x) e^{-\\\\omega t} \\\\) was applied, it is challenging to accurately deduce \\\\( u(x) \\\\) from \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\). The exponential factor can drastically alter the observed values, making it impossible to resolve \\\\( u(x) \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
