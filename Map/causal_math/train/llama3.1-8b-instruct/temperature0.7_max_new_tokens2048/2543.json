  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} [u(x)] = M u(x) \\\\) where M is a linear operator. An operator transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Nx} u(x) \\\\) is introduced, with N being another linear operator. Analyze the influence of this transformation on the behavior of the function u(x) over the domain.\n\nIf at some point x_1, a new transformation \\\\( S(u) = e^{Kx}u(x) \\\\) (where K is a linear operator) is applied, will the system's behavior at \\\\( u(X) \\\\) for X > x_1 depend only on M and not N or K?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( S(u) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, making the final state at \\\\( u(X) \\\\) dependent not only on M but also on N and K. The interactions between these operators can change the trajectory and endpoint significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
