  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) in which both x and y are differentiable real-valued functions of t. We apply a transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) where A is a constant real number and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( u(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) (where B is a different constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( u(z) \\\\) introduces a secondary phase-altering factor, influencing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the transformations via A and B. Each transformation modifies the phase differently, thereby affecting the ultimate state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
