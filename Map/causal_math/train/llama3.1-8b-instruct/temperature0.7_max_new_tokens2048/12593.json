  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and let an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(g) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} g(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. The study involves analyzing how transformations affect the function and its integration outcomes.\n\nGiven the result of the transform \\\\( T(g) \\\\), can we precisely reconstruct the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) solely based on the integrated outcome without knowing \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the parameter \\\\( s \\\\) used in the integral transform, reconstructing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) exactly is not feasible since \\\\( s \\\\) significantly influences the behavior of the integral result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
