  "Problem": "Analyze a control system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. The system's state is manipulated by a transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{Dt}u \\\\), where D is a matrix. The manipulation occurs over time t and has implications for the evolution of the state.\n\nIf at an intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( k(u) = e^{Ft}u \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the system's endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of \\\\( k(u) = e^{Ft}u \\\\), the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) will depend on the effects of D, F, and L. These transformations can influence the trajectory in a complex manner, impacting the final state at time T through their interplay.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
