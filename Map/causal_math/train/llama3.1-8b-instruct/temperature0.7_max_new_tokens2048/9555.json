  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). A boundary condition modification is introduced by the function \\\\(f(u) = u + k\\\\sin(u)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant, defined on the boundary \\\\(\\\\partial\\\\Omega\\\\).\n\nIf an additional boundary function \\\\( g(u) = u^2 + k^2 \\\\cos(u) \\\\) is introduced as an intervention during the observation period, will the resulting solution inside \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) still strictly comply with the unaltered Laplace equation?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another boundary condition alteration like \\\\( g(u) \\\\) imposes further changes to the solution in \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). The solution then will comply with the Laplace equation under transformed boundary conditions influenced by multiple factors (both \\\\(f(u)\\\\) and \\\\(g(u)\\\\)), not just the original Laplace equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
