  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) follow the differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with constant matrices A and B. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the trajectory of z over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new dynamics, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on C and D, in addition to A and B. The compounded effects of \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) influence the overall trajectory and final position.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
