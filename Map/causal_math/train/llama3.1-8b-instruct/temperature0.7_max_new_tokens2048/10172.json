  "Problem": "Analyze the impact on the solution of an integral equation \\\\( x(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) is a control function. We investigate the effects of transformations defined by \\\\( h(x) = Cx \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, applied at different times.\n\nCan we ascertain exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both) by observing only the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Observation of the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone does not provide sufficient information to deduce the sequence or type of transformations applied. Both \\\\( Cx \\\\) and \\\\( Dx \\\\) affect the trajectory in potentially overlapping ways, making it impossible to uniquely identify the transformations based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
