  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a diagonalizable matrix. We introduce an operator transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\), where A is another matrix, and analyze its effect on the system over a period of time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( F(x) = Ax \\\\) changes the initial conditions of the system by transforming \\\\( x_0 \\\\) into \\\\( Ax_0 \\\\). The evolution from \\\\( Ax_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\) generally differs from that of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) unless A commutes with the exponential of M, that is, unless \\\\( AM = MA \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
