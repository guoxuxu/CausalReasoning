  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\), where ω is a constant frequency and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. A Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(ω) = \\\\int_{-∞}^{∞} z(t) e^{-iωt} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform output after applying a damping intervention, can we determine whether the transformation included a damping factor or if the peak shift was due to another factor?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the exact nature of the intervention, it is unclear whether the peak shift in the Fourier transform was due to a damping factor or other modifications (such as additional frequency components or other transformations). The ambiguity in potential modifications precludes precise backward inference about the nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
