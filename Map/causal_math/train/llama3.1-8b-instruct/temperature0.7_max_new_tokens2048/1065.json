  "Problem": "We explore the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z dt \\\\), where D is also a complex constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( I(z) \\\\) is performed on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be identical to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( I(z) \\\\) initially modifies the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating the exponential transformation along the path, adding a varying component dependent on both C and D. This alteration changes the subsequent state progressions, resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
