  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant. The integral transformation maps the time function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at different complex values of \\\\( s \\\\) is of interest.\n\nGiven \\\\( h(z) \\\\) resulting from unknown transformations or interventions, can we determine the exact nature of the interventions (original \\\\( z(t) \\\\), type of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) only using the transformed value \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific interventions or the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the resultant \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is generally not feasible without additional data. Multiple transformations can yield similar results in \\\\( h(z) \\\\), obfuscating which interventions were actually applied, reflecting the ambiguity and non-uniqueness in inverse transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
