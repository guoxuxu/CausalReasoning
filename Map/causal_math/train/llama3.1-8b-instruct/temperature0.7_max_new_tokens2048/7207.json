  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions governed by the differential equations \\\\(du/dt = Au\\\\) and \\\\(dv/dt = Bv\\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) is applied, where C is a constant scalar.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{Dt}z\\\\) (where D is a constant scalar) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on all scalars A, B, C, and D due to the effects of both transformations \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\). These transformations can alter the trajectories of both \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) in a superposed manner affecting the system's endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
