  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. Analyze the impact of applying a boundary condition transformation through \\\\( g(u) = u + k \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf, during the evolution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional boundary condition transformation \\\\( g'(u) = u - k \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, y, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the natural laws (Laplace's equation) and not on the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( g'(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both of the transformations \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g'(u) \\\\) affect the boundary conditions in ways that directly affect the solution. As the Laplace equation is sensitive to boundary condition changes, the final state will depend critically on these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
