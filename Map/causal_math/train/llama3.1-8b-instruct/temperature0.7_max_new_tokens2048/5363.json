  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where C is a complex constant and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. This system undergoes a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operator \\\\( S(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on the original system's parameters \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on A or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional modifications to the system's state. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the original parameters and the transformations introduced by A and D. The specific influences of these matrices on the trajectory can change the outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
