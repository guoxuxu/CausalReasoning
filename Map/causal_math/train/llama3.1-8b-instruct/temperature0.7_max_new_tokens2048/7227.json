  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Qi \\\\), where P and Q are constants. We analyze the behavior under a Fourier transform given by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by applying another transformation \\\\( G(z) = z^2 \\\\) is made, will the resulting spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any time T > t_1 depend solely on the differential equation without any effect from the initial Fourier transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of \\\\( G(z) = z^2 \\\\) significantly modifies the function, adding non-linear alterations to its evolution. As such, even if the function continues to evolve under the same differential equation post-intervention, the spectrum \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) will reflect the compounded effects of the original Fourier transform, the differential equation, and the non-linear intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
