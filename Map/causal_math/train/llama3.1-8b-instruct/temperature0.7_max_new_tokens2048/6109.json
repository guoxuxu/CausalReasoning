  "Problem": "Examine a continuous mathematical model using a Fourier transform, where a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) representing a signal is transformed into a frequency domain represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The causal properties of the system are influenced when a filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2} \\\\), with a real constant \\\\( a \\\\), is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) affects the attenuation of the signal's components depending on their frequency.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) is initially applied to a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then passed through the filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) without additional modifications, will the resulting signal in the time domain \\\\( x'(t) \\\\), obtained by inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( H(\\\\omega)X(\\\\omega) \\\\), be identical to the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The filtering process \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) by dampening certain frequencies more than others, depending on their magnitude. This leads to changes in the original signal when transformed back to the time domain, hence \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) will not be the same as \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
