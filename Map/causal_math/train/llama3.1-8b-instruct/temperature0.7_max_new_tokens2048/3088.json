  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + au_x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nCan the occurring interventions (change from \\\\(a\\\\) to \\\\(b\\\\)) be conclusively determined by examining \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) only?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple configurations of \\\\(a\\\\), \\\\(b\\\\), and \\\\(t_1\\\\) can yield equivalent end states \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) due to the linearity and superposition in the solution processes, one cannot uniquely determine the nature or timing of interventions merely by observing the end state. The problem lacks sufficient information to infer the specifics of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
