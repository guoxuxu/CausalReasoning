  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the Fourier transform was applied, it can be inverted, and since it operates linearly and reversibly, determining \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) remains possible either directly or through transforming back from the frequency domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
