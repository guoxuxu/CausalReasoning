  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) representing a wave at frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) which transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the s-domain as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\). Analyze the influence of multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by a decay function \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, before applying the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf after applying \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), an intervention adds another decay function, say \\\\( e^{-\\beta t} \\\\), before the Laplace Transform, will the result solely reflect the combined effects of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\), without altering the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding another exponential decay \\\\( e^{-\\beta t} \\\\) effectively combines with the initial decay, resulting in a total decay factor of \\\\( e^{-(\\alpha + \\beta) t} \\\\). The Laplace Transform of this compounded function leads to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha + \\beta - i \\omega} \\\\), where the frequency component \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remains unchanged, but the decay rate sum reflects both \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\beta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
