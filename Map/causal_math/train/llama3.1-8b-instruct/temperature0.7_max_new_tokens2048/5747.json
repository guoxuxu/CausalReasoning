  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) and transformations are applied as \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{ht}z \\\\) (where \\\\( h \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial driving function \\\\( iz \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), leading to a complex exponential accumulation different from just the dynamics driven by \\\\( iz \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), and the dynamics defined by \\\\( iz \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
