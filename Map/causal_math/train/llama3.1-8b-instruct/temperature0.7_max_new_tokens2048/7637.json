  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant angular frequency and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. Analyze the effect of a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) applied to this function.\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) as given evolves over time without any transformation, equals the outcome of applying the Laplace transform on the original function and then finding its inverse, will the system behavior at any time \\( t = T \\) be the same?",
  "Explanation": "Since Laplace transformation and its inverse is an identity operation over the entire function space including \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\), the function's evolution remains unchanged. Therefore, \\( z(T) \\) solely depends on its intrinsic properties defined by \\( \\omega \\) and \\( z_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
