  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represents a complex function of a real variable t. We aim to explore whether the function \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant, affects the Laplace transform computation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing whether a constant was added to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the addition of the constant c, any constant term in the Laplace transform can be attributed to either the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or the added c. Therefore, it's impossible to perfectly deduce \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowledge of modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
