  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function is then transformed using \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, to study its behavior over time.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention with another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant, is applied, will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 exclusively depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) both modify the trajectory and magnitude of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through their respective exponential factors \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\). Thus, the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), depends not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) due to these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
