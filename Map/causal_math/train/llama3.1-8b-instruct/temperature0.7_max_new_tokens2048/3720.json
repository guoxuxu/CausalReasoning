  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{u}(x, t) \\\\) described by the Navier-Stokes equations with a divergence-free condition. Study the effect of introducing a scalar field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, t) = T(x)e^{\\lambda t} \\\\), where T(x) represents a temperature distribution and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a growth rate, on heat transfer characteristics of the flow.\n\nCan we determine unequivocally whether modulation of the flow with \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x, t) \\\\) was implemented, solely by observing the temperature distribution \\\\( \\\\theta(x, T) \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting temperature field \\\\( \\\\theta(x, T) \\\\) may be similar for different values of \\\\( k \\\\) or even in its absence due to the complex interactions and compensations between advection, diffusion, and external effects. Thus, it's not possible to uniquely pinpoint the intervening controls just by observing the end state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
