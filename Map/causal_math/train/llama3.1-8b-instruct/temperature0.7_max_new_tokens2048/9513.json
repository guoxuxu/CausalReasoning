  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. An integral transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex constant, is applied.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be affected by the transformation \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of the integral transformation \\\\( F \\\\) alters the entire trajectory of the function over the interval from 0 to T. Since \\\\( F \\\\) integrates across the evolution influenced by \\\\( A \\\\) while multiplying by \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), it impacts the development of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), changing its state at any given time T compared to an untransformed evolution.",
