  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( u(x, t) = e^{iwx - iwt} \\\\), a wave equation solution, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effects of applying a differential operator \\\\( L = i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) to test causal relationships in transformations.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) after observing the application of \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at some time T, without any prior knowledge whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Because the operator \\\\( L \\\\) annihilates the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at any t, observing \\\\( L u(x, T) = 0 \\\\) allows us to conclude the same form of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) must have existed at t = 0, thus deducing \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) correctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
