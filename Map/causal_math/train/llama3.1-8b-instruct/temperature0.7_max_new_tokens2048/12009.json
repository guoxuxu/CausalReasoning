  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the impact of applying an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(h) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Bt}h(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix and T is a fixed time.\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( g(h) \\\\), can we infer the specific range of \\\\( z \\\\) used in the original function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the range was specified before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The output of \\\\( g(h) \\\\) is an aggregated result of integrating over whatever range was used. Without explicit knowledge of the original range bounds, different ranges could produce the same or similar outputs, especially if the properties of B and A lead to overlapping effects in the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
