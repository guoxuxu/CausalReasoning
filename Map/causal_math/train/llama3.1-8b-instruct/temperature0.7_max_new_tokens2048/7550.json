  "Problem": "Consider a physical system represented by a vector function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( v(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x, t)](k) \\\\), and subsequently manipulating the system using a filter function \\\\( H(k) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system's state in the frequency domain \\\\( v(k, T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely recover the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether a filter was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Recovery of the initial state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( v(k, T) \\\\) assumes no alteration by external functions such as a filter. Without confirming the absence of such interventions, multiple initial conditions could correspond to the same \\\\( v(k, T) \\\\), especially if transformations alter the frequency components differently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying a filter function H(k) → Modifying the system state v(k, t); Applying a Fourier transform → Modifying the system state u(x, t); u(x, 0) → v(k, T); v(k, T) → System's state in the frequency domain at time T; L(u) → Modifying the system state u(x, t); u(x, t) → System's state in the time domain; v(k, t) → System's state in the frequency domain"
