  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time is investigated.\n\nBased on the outcome of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} (s) \\\\), can we determine the exact frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without knowing any other details?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} (s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) directly reveals the pole at \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\), thus allowing us to precisely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the transform outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
