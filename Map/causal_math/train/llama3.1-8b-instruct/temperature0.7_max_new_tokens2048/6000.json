  "Problem": "We consider a mathematical model where two complex variables, z and w, are related via the transform \\( f(z) = ze^{iw} \\) at an initial time t = 0. Over time, w evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Aw \\), with A being a complex constant. We examine the influence of an early intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\) defined by the function \\( g(w) = w + C \\), where C is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\( z(T) \\), can we determine exactly what interventions were used (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(w) \\), or both), merely by knowing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) could result from multiple combinations of the initial transformation \\( f(z) \\) and/or the intervention \\( g(w) \\), affecting z's trajectory in complex manners. The transformation and intervention interplay, making it not feasible to pinpoint the exact sequence or nature of interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
