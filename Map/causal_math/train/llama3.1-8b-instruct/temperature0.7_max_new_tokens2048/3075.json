  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamic system modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant square matrix. The impact on the system's trajectory of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\\\), where C and D are also constant matrices, is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( k(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied, does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on matrix M and not on C, D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexity to the system, which affects the trajectory and the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the final state depends on the interplay and possibly non-commutative effects of matrices C, D, F, and M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
