  "Problem": "Examine a response system governed by the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\) of a function \\(x(t)\\). Assume an exponential function \\(f(x) = e^{kx}\\) acts on \\(x(t)\\) and modifies its behaviour in the Laplace domain.\n\nIf incorporation of an impulse response \\(g(t) = \\delta(t-\\tau)\\) is added at time \\(\\tau\\), will this intervention impact the modified Laplace transform \\(X(s-k)\\) calculated from \\(e^{kx}x(t)\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The impulse response \\(g(t)\\) acts as a Dirac delta function shifting \\(x(t)\\) by \\(\\tau\\). In the Laplace domain, this appears as an exponential factor \\(e^{-s\\tau}\\) multiplicative to \\(X(s)\\), subsequently affecting the overall Laplace transform of the product \\(e^{kx}x(t)\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "exponential function → modified Laplace transform; Laplace transform → impulse response; impulse response → modified Laplace transform; time \\(\\tau\\) → impulse response; impulse response → \\(X(s-k)\\); \\(X(s)\\) → \\(X(s-k)\\)"
