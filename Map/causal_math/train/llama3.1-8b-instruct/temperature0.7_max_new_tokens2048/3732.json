  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nCan the specific interventions (values of A and B) be uniquely determined from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone, after applying the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = K?",
  "Explanation": "Different pairs of A and B can result in the same final state due to the rotational nature of the transformations. For example, an initially larger A rotation could be compensated by a larger opposite B rotation at t = K, making it impossible to uniquely determine both A and B from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
