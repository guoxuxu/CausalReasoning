  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are real constant matrices. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant matrix) is introduced as intervention, will the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the system's native dynamics (A and B) and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) represents an additional complex transformation, resulting in the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) being dependent on all matrices A, B, C, and D. These factors interact through their respective exponential transformations, impacting the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
