  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s\\\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period from 0 to T.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the transformed function from 0 to T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the function could represent a variety of initial conditions or transformations, and the effect of the integral transformation obscures the original form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
