  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t)\\\\, dt\\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) determined by Fourier transform is introduced during the system's evolution, will the dynamics under \\\\(L\\\\) described solely in terms of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) without considering the effects of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) alters how the system evolves by interacting with \\\\(L\\\\) and the original Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The dynamics cannot be solely tied to \\\\(L\\\\) as the intervention with \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) modifies the system’s representation and response in both transform spaces.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
