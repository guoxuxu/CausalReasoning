  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to this function and then subsequently its inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf we are aware that an intervention was implemented in the form of a linear operator \\\\( P(s) \\\\) after the Laplace transform and prior to the inverse Laplace transform, can we determine the nature of \\\\( P(s) \\\\) and the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely by observing the resulting function?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function's form post-intervention will depend on both the operator \\\\( P(s) \\\\) and the initial function. Without explicit information about the operator's characteristics or the parameters of the original function, it's impossible to uniquely determine both the nature of the intervention and the exact form of the original function due to potential non-unique solutions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
