  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\\\), where we transform the coordinates according to the functions \\\\( x(t) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = e^{Bt}y_0 \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We analyze the dynamics of \\\\( z \\\\) over time under these transformations.\n\nIf an intervention alters the functions at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) such that \\\\( x(t) = x_1' = e^{Ct}x_1 \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) = y_1' = e^{Dt}y_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be influenced only by A and B, disregarding C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation factors \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) introduces new dynamics to the system, significantly affecting the values of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) post-intervention. Hence, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, C, and D due to these compositional effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
