  "Problem": "Consider a system based on a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The impact study involves the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a real constant, applied at varying times.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{ct}z \\\\) (where c is a real constant different from k) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend strictly on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the interplay of \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since transformations by \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) scale the magnitude and may alter the phase of \\\\( z \\\\), the resulting state's magnitude and angle depend on all these factors. The compounded effects mean the transformation history influences the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
