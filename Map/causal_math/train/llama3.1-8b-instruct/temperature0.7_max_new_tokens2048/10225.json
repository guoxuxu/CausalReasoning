  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by the heat equation in a rod, described by \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) represents the temperature, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the position along the rod. Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) to the equation and the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) after a specific time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform of the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is taken at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if the initial condition was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Taking the Fourier transform of the initial condition does not change the system's behavior under the heat equation. The transform and inverse transform act as mathematical tools without influencing the physical propagation process of heat in the rod.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
