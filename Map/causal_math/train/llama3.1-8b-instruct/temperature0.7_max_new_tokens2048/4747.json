  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are looking at how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, affect the function over time.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\)) is introduced as an intervention at time t = 0, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) still exclusively reflect the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention, the modified function becomes \\\\( z(t) = e^{-(\\alpha - i \\omega) t} \\\\). The Laplace transform of this function is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i \\omega} \\\\), indicating that the pole of the transform, and hence the frequency component observed, includes the effect of the damping factor along with the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
