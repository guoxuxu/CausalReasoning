  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant, and an integral transformation \\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\). We study how the transformation influences the properties of function \\( f \\) over complex domain.\n\nIf an additional operation \\( g(z) = \\log(z) \\) is applied to transform the function \\( f(z) \\) at some \\( z_1 \\) within its domain, and then \\( T \\) is applied, will \\( T[g \\circ f](s) \\) for \\( s > a \\) solely depend on \\( f(z) \\) without influence of \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( g(z) = \\log(z) \\) before \\( T \\) introduces a functional transformation that significantly alters \\( f(z) \\)'s behavior. The impacts of the logarithmic modification substantially change the resulting \\( T[g \\circ f](s) \\), thus depending on both functions and their interplay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
