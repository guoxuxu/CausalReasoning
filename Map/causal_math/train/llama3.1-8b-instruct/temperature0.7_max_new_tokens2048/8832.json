  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a Laplace transform used on a physical system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, \\\\( x \\\\) is the position, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( L(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) is considered.\n\nKnowing only the function obtained from the Laplace transform at time T, \\\\( L(u(T, x)) \\\\), can we discern whether an intervention such as \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) was applied, assuming the heat equation's standard evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace transform at a specific time T contains aggregated information influenced both by the natural laws of the system and any interventions. Without additional context or data about the state at other times or other forms of analysis, pinpointing the effects or even the existence of an intervention like \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) cannot be confidently done.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
