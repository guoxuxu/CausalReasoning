  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Nt} z \\\\, dt \\\\), with N also being a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time T.\n\nCan the specific interventions (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) be conclusively identified from the system's state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) if no additional information about the transformations is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations involve integral operations with matrix exponentials, which can produce overlapping effects on the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\). Without exclusive details about whether and how \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) were applied, it is impossible to distinguish the interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
