  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This system represents a basic integral transformation with a complex exponential kernel. We investigate the influence of a matrix multiplier \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can the specific interventions (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both) be identified clearly only based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different intervention sequences or magnitudes due to the arbitrary matrix compositions and their additive effects on the system. It's challenging to distinguish the sequences and individual impacts of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) solely based on the final state, due to the properties of matrix operations in complex spaces.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
