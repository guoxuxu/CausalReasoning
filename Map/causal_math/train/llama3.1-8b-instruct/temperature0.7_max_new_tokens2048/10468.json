  "Problem": "We consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore scenarios involving the integral transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, to analyze how transformations and interventions affect the system.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine if any interventions (like scaling by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) were applied, just from the transformed value?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise nature or existence of interventions such as scaling solely from the endpoint \\\\( F(z(T)) \\\\) is not feasible. The integration and transformation process may mask or mimic the effects of interventions, making it impossible to precisely deduce the type or presence of scaling or other alterations made during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
