  "Problem": "Consider a functional system governed by the equation \\\\( z = f(x) \\\\) where \\\\( f(x) = \\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We analyze the alterations in system behavior by introducing an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) that modifies the integral operation.\n\nCan the value of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) be precisely determined if we observe only the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some \\\\( z \\\\) without knowing the form or the parameters of \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), it is impossible to reverse-engineer the value of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) due to the potential complexity and non-invertibility of the integral of \\\\( e^{t^2} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
