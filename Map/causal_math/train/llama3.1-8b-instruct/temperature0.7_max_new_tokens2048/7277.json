  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nIf \\( u(x, 0) \\) is transformed by \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( u(x, T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( u(x, 0) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) changes the representation of the function from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. Although the evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) still holds, the initial conditions are altered by the Fourier transform, thus affecting the system's state at any later time \\( T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
