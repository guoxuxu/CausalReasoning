  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). The system's evolution is examined under the impact of this transformation over time t.\n\nGiven the observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations used (\\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\) or both) based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging since different combinations could lead to the same endpoint, particularly given the potential for phase and amplitude modifications by each matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
