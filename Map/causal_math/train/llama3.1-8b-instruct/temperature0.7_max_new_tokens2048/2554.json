  "Problem": "Let's consider a system where the temperature distribution, u(x,t), in a rod over time t is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation function \\\\( f(u) = e^{-\\lambda t}u \\\\) represents a cooling process influenced by a cooling constant \\\\( \\lambda \\\\).\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T, can the original temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be determined without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) alters the scale of the original temperature distribution. Without clear information whether this transformation was applied, it's impossible to reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) just from the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), as this transformation could mask the original values through exponential scaling.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
