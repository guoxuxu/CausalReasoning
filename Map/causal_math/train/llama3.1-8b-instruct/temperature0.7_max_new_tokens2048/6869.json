  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Investigate how the Fourier transform affects this system, particularly through a transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) is the variable of transformation.\n\nIf the system starts with the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and evolves over time without any intervention, will the result of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) be a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When the system evolving as \\\\( e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier transform, the inherent properties of the transform and the specific frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the function result in a delta function \\\\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\\\), indicating the transform's ability to isolate the frequency component exactly matching \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
