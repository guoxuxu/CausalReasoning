  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant diffusivity. The rod undergoes a transformation due to a boundary condition change represented by \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at one end, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a constant.\n\nCan we unambiguously determine the exact type of interventions applied (both the boundary change and the diffusivity intervention), based solely on the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The cumulative effects of altered boundary conditions and diffusivity changes make it difficult to distinctly attribute the final temperature distribution to specific interventions. The non-linear interactions in heat transfer hinder precise reverse tracing of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
