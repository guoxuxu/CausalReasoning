  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mx}u \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix and x representing spatial variables.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the same equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system by multiplying by \\\\( e^{Mx} \\\\), which can significantly alter the behavior of the solution over time, depending on the properties of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\). This results in a potentially different solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
