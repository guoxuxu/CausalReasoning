  "Problem": "The system under study is governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) represents a linear differential operator. The impact of an integral transformation represented by the convolution \\\\( u \\\\ast K \\\\), where \\\\(K\\\\) is a kernel function, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely and exclusively the kernels used (whether \\\\( K \\\\) alone, \\\\( J \\\\) alone, or both), based solely on the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modifications induced by convolutions with \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( J \\\\) and the evolution due to \\\\( L \\\\) can result in similar final states from different initial conditions and convolution sequences. Due to the convolutional properties and the potential similar output from different kernels, uniquely specifying which kernels were used based solely on \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
