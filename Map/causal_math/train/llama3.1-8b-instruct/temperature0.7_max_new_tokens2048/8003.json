  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation under various conditions. We analyze the impact of a non-linear transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(v) = \\\\sinh(kv) \\\\) where k is a constant, on the initial velocity profile \\\\( v(x, 0) \\\\) of the fluid.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a damping function \\\\( h(v) = e^{-\\u03bct}v \\\\) where \\u03bc is a damping coefficient, is applied at time t = t_1, will the velocity profile \\\\( v(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the Navier-Stokes dynamics and not by the initial transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(v) \\\\) does not cancel out or isolate the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( g(v) \\\\). The resulting velocity profile at any time T > t_1 will be a result of both the initial non-linear transformation and the damping effect, as well as the underlying fluid dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
