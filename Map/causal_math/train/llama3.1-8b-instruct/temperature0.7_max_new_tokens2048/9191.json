  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system's states. The Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is used for analysis.\n\nIf an intervention described by a multiplicative constant matrix \\\\( B \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\) leading to a state change \\\\( z(t_1) = Bz(t_1) \\\\), will the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s = s_0 afterwards depend only on the dynamics of the original system without considering the effects of B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the matrix \\\\( B \\\\) as an intervention modifies the state of the system, thereby altering the component functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). This change directly impacts the Laplace transform, making \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( B \\\\) as well as the inherent dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
