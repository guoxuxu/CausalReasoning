  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on a complex domain \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x, y) \\\\) are the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Assume that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, indicating that \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is holomorphic. We study the impact of an integral transformation represented by \\\\( \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(z) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a real or complex constant.\n\nGiven the output from the transformation, can we deduce which specific function, \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\), was involved in the process?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process's output is influenced collectively by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the intervening function \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This composite impact means that the transformation's output could be derived from various combinations of holomorphic and non-holomorphic interactions, obscuring the ability to pinpoint which functions were specifically involved without additional distinguishing data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
