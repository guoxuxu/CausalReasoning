  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The effect of a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), on this system is analyzed.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z) \\\\) post-intervention, can we precisely identify whether the change was in matrix A or matrix B, just based on \\\\( L(z) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to infinity?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( L(z) \\\\) could exhibit changes due to alterations in either the matrix A or B or both, particularly under non-trivial time-evolutionary dynamics. Without specific information distinguishing the contributions of x and y within \\\\( L(z) \\\\), it is infeasible to definitively ascertain whether only A, only B, or both were altered during the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
