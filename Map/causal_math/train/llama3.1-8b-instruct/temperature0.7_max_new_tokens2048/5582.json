  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are real numbers and represent the real and imaginary components of the exponent, respectively. The transformation is studied in the context of its Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nBased on observing the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), could one unambiguously determine the initial parameters \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) without knowing the specific form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\frac{1}{i(\\omega - (A+iB))} \\\\), only provides a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega = B \\\\), conveying information about the imaginary component (B), but not directly about the real component (A). Without additional information, the determinant of \\\\( A \\\\) remains uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
