  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are initial complex numbers, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are complex constants. The function’s evolution over time is analyzed considering linear transformations and their implications on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), changing the constants to \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\), will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (\\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be determined only by the new constants \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) and not by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory of the system before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) significantly involves \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The resulting state at any time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) is not only influenced by the new constants \\\\( A' \\\\) and \\\\( B' \\\\) but also by the preceding evolution governed by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Hence, the final state incorporates effects from both sets of constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
