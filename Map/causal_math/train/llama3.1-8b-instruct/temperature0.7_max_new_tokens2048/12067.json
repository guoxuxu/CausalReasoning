  "Problem": "Examine a complex function system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. The system's dynamics are altered by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) where C is a complex constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nGiven knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify which specific transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, relying solely on the final state?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be resultant from various combinations of transformations, due to the overlapping potentials of the non-linear transformations combined with linear evolution. This multiplicity in potential paths leading to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) makes it infeasible to distinctly and precisely backtrack the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → dz/dt; P → dz/dt; C → g(z); n → g(z); g(z) → z(T); T → z(T); z(T) → identification of g(z) and h(z)"
