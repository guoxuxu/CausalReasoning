  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We consider transformations of the form \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z + \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve in accordance with \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be identical to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + \\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value of \\\\( z \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory due to the compound effects of factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and the constant addition of \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). This change leads to a different final state at T that isn't just dependent on the parameters \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
