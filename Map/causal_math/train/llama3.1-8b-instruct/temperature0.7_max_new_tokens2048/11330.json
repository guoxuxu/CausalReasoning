  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( K(t) \\\\) is a kernel representing a transformation and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is an input signal. We analyze the impact of modifying the kernel to \\\\( K'(t) = e^{At}K(t) \\\\) where A is a constant.\n\nCan we deduce whether the original kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) or the modified kernel \\\\( K'(t) \\\\) was used just by observing the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information on the nature of the input signal or the specifics of the constant A, it's challenging to uniquely determine which kernel was used based on the output alone. The transformation could produce similar effects for different types of inputs or A values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
