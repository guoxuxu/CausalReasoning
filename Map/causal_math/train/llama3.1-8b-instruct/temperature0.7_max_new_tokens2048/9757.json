  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) is applied to \\( u(x, 0) \\) and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will \\( u(x, t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( u(x, 0) \\) was directly evolved to t = T under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform to \\( u(x, 0) \\) and its subsequent evolution under the heat equation simply represents a change of basis (from spatial domain to frequency domain). Since the heat equation and the Fourier transform are linear operations and the transformation is reversible, the evolved state \\( u(x, T) \\) will still correspond to directly evolving \\( u(x, 0) \\) to \\( u(x, T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
