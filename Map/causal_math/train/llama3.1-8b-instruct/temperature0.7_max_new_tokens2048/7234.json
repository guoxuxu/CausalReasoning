  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\(\\{ z(t) \\}\\) that maps complex numbers onto a complex plane. The function is defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial complex number. We explore the effects of the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is another real constant, on the evolution of this system.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( z(T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( f(z) \\), it is impossible to determine whether the scaling by \\( e^{\\alpha T} \\) was part of the initial condition or purely a result of the exponential growth due to \\( e^{i \\omega T} \\). Consequently, \\( z_0 \\) cannot be accurately deduced from \\( z(T) \\) without this information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
