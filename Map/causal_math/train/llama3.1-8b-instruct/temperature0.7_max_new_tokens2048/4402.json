  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = -v \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = u + \\\\alpha v \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant. We also consider the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transformed function \\\\( L(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), it is impossible to trace back the transformed function to its original form due to the direct influence of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) on the system's dynamics, which affects both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), changing the behavior of the transformed function over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
