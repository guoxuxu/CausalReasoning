  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant scalar.\n\nCan one determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( g(z) \\\\)) were applied by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, knowing only the differential equations but no other details?",
  "Explanation": "While transformations like \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) distinctly scale the state, the overlapping effects of these exponential functions can obscure which were actually applied. Different initial conditions and different times or strengths of transformation application can yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the given differential constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
