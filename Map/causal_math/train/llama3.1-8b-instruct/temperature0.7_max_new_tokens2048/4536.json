  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) is studied, where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformations by N and P are integrated exponentially and impact the dynamics instituted by M, these effects might yield similar end results through different combinations, making it difficult to trace back and uniquely determine the sequence of interventions used based on the endpoint alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
