  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a vector function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x \\\\, dt \\\\) over a time period T, where A is a square matrix. We examine the changes induced by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific interventions used (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or none) be determined just by observing the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions or none at all, particularly due to the linear transformations being potentially overlapping in effect. The linear nature of matrix multiplications and exponentials allows for multiple possible initial conditions and transformations that yield the same final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
