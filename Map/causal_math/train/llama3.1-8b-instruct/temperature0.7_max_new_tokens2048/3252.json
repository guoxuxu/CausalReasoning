  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) is the state variable depending both on time \\\\(t\\\\) and spatial position \\\\(x\\\\). Investigate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\\\), which transforms spatial coordinates into frequency coordinates.\n\nConsidering the system's final state at \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}[u(T,x)]\\\\), is it possible to deduce which filter \\\\(\\\\mathcal{G}(k)\\\\) was applied at t_1, given the frequency-domain data only?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific filter used requires more information than just the endpoint frequencies, due to potential equivalencies in the transformation effects of different filters. Multiple different filters can lead to comparable modifications in the state's evolution, resulting in indistinguishable end states from frequency-domain data alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
