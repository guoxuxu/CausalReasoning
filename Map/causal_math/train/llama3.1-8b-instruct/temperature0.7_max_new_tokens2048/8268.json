  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + z u_x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex constant. Examine the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) in modifying the system dynamics.\n\nKnowing the state of the system at a later time \\\\( t \\\\), can one definitively determine whether a Laplace transform, a Fourier transform, or both were applied during the evolution of the solution?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions purely from end-state data is generally uncertain due to possible equivalences in the effects produced by different transformation methods on the solution. The overlapping impacts and possible interdependencies between transformations like Laplace and Fourier obscure the interventions’ identities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
