  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function scenario where the initial function is \\\\( z(t) = C t^2 + iD \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) being real numbers. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t, with A being a real constant.\n\nCan the initial state of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be exactly deduced from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation factors \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) complicate back-calculating to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) accurately. The exponential influence is essential information missing, making it impossible to reverse the process particularly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
