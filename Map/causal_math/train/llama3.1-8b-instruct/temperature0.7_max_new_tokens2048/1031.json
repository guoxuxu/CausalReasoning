  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u = D \\\\partial_{xx} u \\\\) where D is a diffusion constant. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(u) = u*e^{Ct} \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the behavior of the function by introducing a multiplicative exponential factor, which impacts the diffusion process differently than the baseline diffusion equation. The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) thus depends both on \\\\( D \\\\) and the transformation parameters \\\\( C \\\\), altering the evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
