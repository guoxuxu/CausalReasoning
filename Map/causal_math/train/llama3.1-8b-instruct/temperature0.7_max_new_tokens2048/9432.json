  "Problem": "Consider the control system defined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky + u\\\\), where K is a constant matrix and \\\\(u\\\\) represents the control input. We examine the behavior under the transformation \\\\( y \\mapsto H(t) y \\\\), where \\\\(H(t) = e^{Mt}\\\\) and M is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we identify precisely which interventions (\\\\(H(t)\\\\), \\\\(G(t)\\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the final state \\\\(y(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used by only observing the final state \\\\(y(T)\\\\) is generally infeasible, especially if the transformations represented by \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Nt}\\\\) have overlapping or indistinguishable effects on the trajectory. The non-commutative properties of such matrix exponentials and potential similarity in resultant states further obfuscate the capacity to pinpoint exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
