  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf we modify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) by applying a new function \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, and then calculate \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will this alteration change the final value of the integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{-it} \\\\) clearly changes the trajectory of the integral. The phase reversal introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the contribution of the function to the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, resulting in a different endpoint value of \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
