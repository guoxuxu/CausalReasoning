  "Problem": "Examine a complex function system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. The system's dynamics are altered by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) where C is a complex constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nAssuming an intervention with another transformation \\\\( h(z) = Dz^m \\\\) (where D is a complex constant and m is an integer) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined only by the parameter P?",
  "Explanation": "The series of transformations applied modify the trajectory and final state significantly. Both the non-linear effects of \\\\( z^n \\\\) and \\\\( z^m \\\\) along with their respective scaling factors C and D, in concert with the linear transformation by P, contribute to forming the final observed state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
