  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) and then analyzing the resultant complex function.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the exact nature of the transformation operator \\\\( H(s) \\\\) applied to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) purely from the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant transformed function \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) could potentially be produced by various combinations of original functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and transformation operators \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The non-uniqueness of compositions in the complex frequency domain means multiple plausible pairs of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), making unique identification impractical without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
