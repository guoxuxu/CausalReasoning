  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( S \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to explicitly determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( T[z] \\\\), \\\\( K[z] \\\\), or both), simply by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexities introduced by multiple possible transformations (integral and exponential) and their combinations, the resulting endpoint at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely correspond to specific transformations. The overlap in the possible effects of \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( U \\\\) on the system dynamics obscured by \\\\( P \\\\), makes singular determination of past transformations infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
