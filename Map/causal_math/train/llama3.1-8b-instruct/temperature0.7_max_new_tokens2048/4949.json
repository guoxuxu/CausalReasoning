  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex number. Analyze the causality and effects of modifying the function by a multiplicative factor \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\), where k is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then transformed using the given integral transformation, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be similar to transforming \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) directly, without the multiplication by \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) on \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) changes the function to \\\\( z_0(t) e^{kt} \\\\) before applying the transformation. This alteration changes the decay or growth properties of the function relative to the transformation's operator \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\), resulting in a different Laplace transform, specifically \\\\( Z(s-k) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
