  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices defining separate dynamical systems for the real and imaginary parts, respectively. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), we introduce a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) where T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, without any influence from C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) dependent on the impacts of A, B, C, and D. The multiple matrix exponentials involve complex interactions potentially leading to compositional and non-trivial modifications of the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
