  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\(u_t = u_{xx}\\\\), governing the temperature distribution u(x,t) in a rod along x axis. We consider the impact of an initial temperature distribution manipulated by the function \\\\(g(u) = Au + h\\\\), where A is a constant and h is a constant function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(y) = By - k \\\\) (where B is a constant and k is a constant function) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial manipulation \\\\( g \\\\) and not on the intervention \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(y) = By - k \\\\) introduces additional changes to the temperature distribution, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) reliant on both the initial manipulation \\\\( g \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h \\\\). The endpoint reflects the cumulative effect of both modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
