  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the application of the Laplace transform on this function and its inverse to determine system behavior over time.\n\nIf the transformation defined by \\\\( w(t) = te^{at} \\\\) (introducing a multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\)) is applied to the function and then it undergoes a Laplace transform, will the effect on the Laplace domain depend only on the original \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by multiplying \\\\( t \\\\) alters the Laplace transform from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2} \\\\), clearly showing a dependency not only on \\\\( a \\\\) but also the nature of the intervention (multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
