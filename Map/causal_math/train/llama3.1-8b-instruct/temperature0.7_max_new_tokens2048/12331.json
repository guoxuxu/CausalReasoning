  "Problem": "Analyze a physical system where the temperature distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature at position x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity constant. A transformation is applied: \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\\\) where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a heating function.\n\nGiven the final observed temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the interventions \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both were applied, only by examining \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end temperature distribution could result from numerous scenarios involving different timings and magnitudes of heat addition and cooling (\\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( c(t) \\\\)). Without precise records of such interventions, multiple histories could lead to the same observed distribution at T, thus obfuscating definitive causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
