  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Analyze the effect of an initial condition transformed by function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a constant matrix, on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nAssume that at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new intervention \\\\( j(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is a different constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent only on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( N \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system's final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will depend on the initial transformation \\\\( N \\\\), the matrix governing the dynamics \\\\( M \\\\), and the intervention matrix \\\\( D \\\\). The interplay between these matrices, particularly how they modify each other’s effects, ensures that \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by more than just \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
