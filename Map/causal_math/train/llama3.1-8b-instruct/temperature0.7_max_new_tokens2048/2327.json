  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on the complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze how different scenarios involving the Laplace transformation affect the interpretation of the function and its inverse.\n\nIf a modulation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-az} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, will the result depend only on the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the input to the Laplace transform, resulting in a shifted or altered Laplace transform \\\\( F(s + a) \\\\) compared to the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Thus, the resultant transform depends on both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), not just on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
