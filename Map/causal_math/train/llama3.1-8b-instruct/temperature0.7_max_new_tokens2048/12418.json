  "Problem": "Consider a system where the position of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx\\\\) with a given constant k. The influence of an external transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constants, is considered over time t.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( j(x) = Fe^{Gt}x \\\\) (where F and G are constants) is applied as an intervention, will the final position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on k and not on D or G?",
  "Explanation": "The application of new transformations modifies the state of the system again, making the final position at time T dependent not only on the harmonic motion dictated by k but also on the effects introduced by the transformations D and G through their exponential influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
