  "Problem": "Examine the impact of a Fourier transform on the system governed by the partial differential equation describing heat conduction \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) represents temperature distribution along a rod and \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. The Fourier transform of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) with respect to space is defined as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx\\\\).\n\nCan we accurately retrieve the original temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, t=0) \\\\) by inverse transforming \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) without knowledge of correct phase shifts introduced during transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Successful reconstruction of \\\\( u(x, t=0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) requires accurate phase information which is dictated by the original conditions and evolution; missing or incorrect phase shift information may result in significant reconstruction errors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
