  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), where f(t) represents a time-dependent function and s is a complex number. An input signal f(t) is being studied for its transformation and response properties under different conditions and manipulations.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where a is a real number, is transformed by the Laplace transform without any alterations, will the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) provided Re(s) > a?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) directly yields \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) assuming Re(s) > a as per the definition and properties of the Laplace transform. The direct application of the transform yields a predictable and deterministic outcome without any interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
