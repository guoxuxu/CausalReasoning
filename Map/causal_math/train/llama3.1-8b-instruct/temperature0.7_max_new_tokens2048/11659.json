  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit system where the voltage across a capacitor (V) is related to the charge (Q) by the relation \\\\( V = \\\\frac{Q}{C} \\\\) where C is the capacitance. Additionally, a sinusoidal input voltage is transformed by a Laplace transformation, resulting in a transformed output that is affected by the system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf during the process, a new capacitor with a different capacitance \\\\( C' \\\\) is added in parallel at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system continues to evolve, will the voltage V(T) at T > t_1 depend solely on initial conditions and the original capacitance C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of adding a new capacitor changes the total capacitance, thus altering the voltage output dynamically from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, which in turn changes the system's response to the same sinusoidal input. The system's behavior now depends on both C and C', not just the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
