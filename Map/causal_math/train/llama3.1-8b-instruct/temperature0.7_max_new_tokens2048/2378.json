  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow modeled by the function \\\\( p(x, t) \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) represents the pressure at a point \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\). The evolution of pressure is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 p \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. Now, analyze the scenario under transformation given by the function \\\\( h(p) = e^{-kt} p \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nBy examining \\\\( p(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we conclusively determine the initial pressure \\\\( p_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( h(p) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( e^{-kt} \\\\) modifies the initial state, lacking knowledge about the application of \\\\( h(p) \\\\), we cannot accurately back-calculate to the original state \\\\( p_0(x) \\\\). The decay factor introduced by \\\\( k \\\\) obscures the true initial conditions.",
