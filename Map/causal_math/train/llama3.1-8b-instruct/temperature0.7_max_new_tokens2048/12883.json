  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} dt \\\\), where z is a complex number with a positive real part. We explore the impact of two transformations defined by the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) on the complex plane as \\\\( A(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( B(z) = z + 1 \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after various transformations and interventions, can we deduce exactly which transformations (\\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), or \\\\( g \\\\)) have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and non-reversible nature of complex function transformations and their impact on the integration in \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is not feasible to back-calculate and identify the exact transformations applied. The transformations possibly overlap in effects, making it ambiguous and indiscernible from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z → f(z); z → A(z); z → B(z); A(z) → f(z); B(z) → f(z); f(z) → A(f(z)); f(z) → B(f(z))"
