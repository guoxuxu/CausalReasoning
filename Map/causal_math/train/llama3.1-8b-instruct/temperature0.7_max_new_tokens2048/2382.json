  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine changes when applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, modifying the amplitude and phase.\n\nGiven the state of the system at time T as \\\\( z(T) = k e^{i \\omega T} \\\\), can we conclude that the transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) was indeed applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "From \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone, without prior knowledge of the initial condition or the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), multiple causative factors could lead to the same observed state, such as different values of \\\\( k \\\\) or even other types of transformations not considered here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
