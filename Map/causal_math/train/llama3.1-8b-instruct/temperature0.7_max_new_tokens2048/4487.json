  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). The function examines evolution under a rotational transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modeled by another complex function \\\\( g(t) = e^{iBt}y \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new variable \\\\( B \\\\) and can modify the trajectory and final state of the system depending on how \\\\( B \\\\) relates to \\\\( A \\\\). Even if the effects are similar when both are proportional, in general scenarios they usually combine to influence the outcome in complex ways that depend on both matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
