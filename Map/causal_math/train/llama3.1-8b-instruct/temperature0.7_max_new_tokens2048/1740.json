  "Problem": "Suppose we are examining a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(F(s)\\\\) potentially depends on parameter \\\\(a\\\\). We evaluate the system's behavior changes under the modification of \\\\(f(t)\\\\) by a function \\\\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint Laplace transform \\\\(F(s-a+b)\\\\) after subsequent transformations by \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\), can we definitively infer the interventions (both \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\)) solely from \\\\(F(s-a+b)\\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The final state represented by \\\\(F(s-a+b)\\\\) does not uniquely specify the sequence of transformations due to the commutative nature of the exponential modifications in the time domain impacting the same net shift in the frequency domain. Multiple combinations of \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) might result in the same net effect, obscuring the specific details of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
