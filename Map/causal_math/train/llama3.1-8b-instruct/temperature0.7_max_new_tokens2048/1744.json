  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. Investigate the system's behavior under the influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), applied and then reversed on the function.\n\nBy witnessing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we identify if an intervention (particularly, a Laplace-related operation like \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) was applied earlier during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential overlapping effects of interventions, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to unequivocally discern whether any specific intervention, such as \\\\( h(z) \\\\), was implemented during the system's evolution, especially without comprehensive details on each operation's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
