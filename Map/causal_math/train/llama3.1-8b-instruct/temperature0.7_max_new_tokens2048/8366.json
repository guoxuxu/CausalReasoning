  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant complex matrix. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nCan we recover the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its integral transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) without knowing the value of s?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) involves an exponential function of s which obscures some information about z(t) due to the integration over all time. Without knowledge of the specific s used in the transform, the original function z(t) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
