  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. This function is used in transformations of signals in a system described by the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} h(t)z(t) dt \\\\), with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being the system's impulse response.\n\nFrom observing the output of the system at any given time \\\\( T \\\\), can one necessarily determine the exact form of the input signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the impulse function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of convolution in the integral transformation, multiple combinations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can yield the same output, creating an inherent ambiguity in deducing the exact cause (original inputs and system properties) from the observed effect (output).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
