  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We also consider the impact of Laplace transformation on this function, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nWill applying the Laplace transformation to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then computing the inverse Laplace transform result in the same function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation and its inverse are designed to be inverse operations. Assuming all conditions for the existence of the Laplace transform and its inverse are met (such as convergence of the integral), applying these operations in sequence will recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
