  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) inserts a new phase shift, resulting in an endpoint depending on both the original phase shift parameter \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), the new shift \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the system's inherent frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\theta + \\\\alpha)(T - t_1) + i(\\\\omega + \\\\theta)t_1} z_0 \\\\) reflects all these influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
