  "Problem": "We examine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), \\\\( i = \\\\sqrt{-1} \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with P being a complex constant. We then explore the alteration effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Qz \\\\), where Q is a constant complex matrix, on the evolution of z.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), would we be able to determine exactly what transformations were employed (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), merely from knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially be the result of different series or types of interventions, possibly combined or applied at different intervals. The complex interaction of matrix effects and initial conditions makes it unattainable to uniquely specify the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
