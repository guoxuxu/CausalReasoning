  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) acting on this function.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) at some s, can we precisely conclude what transformations and interventions (original Laplace transformation, scaling by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), or both) were applied based purely on \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and the scaling transformation can both modify the state in ways that could result in similar or indistinguishable effects in the frequency domain, particularly without additional information about the sequence and naturality of these transformations. This overlap in effects precludes precise back-inference of the interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transformation → z̃(s); α scaling → z̃(s); A and B → z̃(s); z(t) → z̃(s); z(t) → x(t); z(t) → y(t); x(t) → \\dot{x}; y(t) → \\dot{y}; \\dot{x} → x(t); \\dot{y} → y(t); L → Laplace transformation; α → α scaling; A and B → constant matrices; z̃(s) → transformations and interventions"
