  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant denoting angular frequency. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iws}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of the transform \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely recover \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) represents the integral of the function over time, it holds more information about the cumulative effect rather than initial conditions directly. Recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) without knowing its application is ambiguous due to the loss of information about the phase and original amplitude in the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
