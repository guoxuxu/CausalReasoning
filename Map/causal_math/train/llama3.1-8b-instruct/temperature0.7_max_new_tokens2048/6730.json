  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant diffusivity. The rod undergoes a transformation due to a boundary condition change represented by \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) at one end, with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a constant.\n\nUsing the thermal profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we precisely infer whether the boundary condition \\\\( u(0,t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Various initial and boundary conditions could yield similar temperature distributions at time T due to the nature of heat diffusion, making it challenging to uniquely identify the presence of the specific exponential boundary condition without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
