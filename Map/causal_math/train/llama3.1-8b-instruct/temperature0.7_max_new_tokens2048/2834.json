  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with respect to its behavior modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = f(t) \\\\), where p and q are constants. The Laplace transform of the differential equation is considered to see the change in the solution's domain from time to frequency.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by observing only the solution \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to the differential equation at various times \\\\( t \\\\) without knowing whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and the subsequent operations on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the frequency domain, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\). Multiple functions can give rise to the same differential behavior, especially without specifics on initial conditions or transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
