  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(z) = \\int_{t_1}^T e^{Qs} z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( Q \\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depend solely on \\( M \\) and not on \\( N \\) or \\( Q \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(z) \\) introduces another integral transformation that will affect the state at \\( t = T \\), contributing effects from \\( N \\), \\( Q \\), as well as \\( M \\). These transformations interact and overlap in complex ways, causing the final state to be influenced by all parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
