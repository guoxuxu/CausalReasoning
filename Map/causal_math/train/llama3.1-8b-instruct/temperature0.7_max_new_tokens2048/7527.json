  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves over time according to \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the consequences of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) over a time period [0,T].\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T merely be a function of the initial C and not of the newly applied Laplace operator?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a Laplace transform as an intervention modifies the state of the system, affecting both the time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). As a result, the final Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = T will depend on the effects of both the initial complex matrix C and the characteristics introduced by the Laplace operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
