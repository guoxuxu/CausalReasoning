  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relations in a linear system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We then consider the impact of invoking transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) on vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and on the time evolution described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine which transformations were made (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The superposition and compositional nature of linear transformations with exponentials in different matrices makes it challenging to backtrack distinct interventions uniquely. The final observed state could potentially result from a variety of transformation sequences involving \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), and hence cannot determinatively suggest specific interventions were employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
