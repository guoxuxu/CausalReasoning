  "Problem": "Consider a function mapping from the complex plane to itself given by \\\\( z \\mapsto w = e^{az+b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate the effects of this transformation under the integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) be deduced from the integral \\\\( \\int_C e^{az+b} f(z) \\, dz \\\\) if the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), reversibly identifying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the integral where \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is scaled and shifted by \\\\( e^{az+b} \\\\) is indeterminate. Parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) affect the exponentiation, making exact recovery of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) from the integral uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
