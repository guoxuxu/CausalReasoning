  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number frequency parameter. This function represents a complex exponential oscillation. Analyze the transformation with the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state with a phase shift intervention, can we determine the exact value of the phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) just by analyzing at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the presence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be clearly identified, the exact value of the phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) affects the complex phase of the spectrum at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but cannot be uniquely determined due to potential ambiguities introduced by periodicity in the phase representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "frequency parameter ω → complex exponential oscillation z(t); complex exponential oscillation z(t) → Fourier transformed state; phase shift φ → Fourier transformed state; Fourier transformed state → phase shift φ; ω → Fourier transformed state"
