  "Problem": "Analyze the influence of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) of a function u(t), where u(t) satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0 \\\\). Consider an intervention where a multiplication factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) is introduced to the solution u(t) before transforming it.\n\nDoes a direct Laplace transformation of u(t), starting with initial conditions u(0) and u'(0), result in the same U(s) regardless of changes in the parameters of the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of a Laplace transformation \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is contingent on the differential equation's parameters. Alterations in these parameters (e.g., coefficients in \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0 \\\\)) significantly impact U(s), as they change the roots of the characteristic equation of the system, thus the poles of U(s) are affected accordingly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
