  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod varies with time and position, governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. Consider an intervention represented by a heat source term \\\\(S(x,t)\\\\) introduced at a position \\\\(x1\\\\) affecting the system.\n\nGiven a non-uniform temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t\\\\), can we precisely determine the initial temperature distribution at \\\\(t=0\\\\) without knowing whether any intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The ability to reverse-engineer the initial distribution from a known state at a later time without information on interventions like additional heat sources is hindered since these sources could alter the path significantly. Without this knowledge, reverse calculation isn’t uniquely resolvable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
