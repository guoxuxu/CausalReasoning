  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and represents the angular frequency. We analyze the manipulation of system dynamics by introducing a Laplace transform, defined by the transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\)\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied at a time t = t1 as an intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) from t = t1 to infinity depend only on the original angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the damping factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the damping factor as an intervention modifies the system's response by introducing an exponential decay, which directly influences the system's domain properties captured by the Laplace transform. Both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) will thus influence the transformed function, incorporating effects of decay as well as the original oscillation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
