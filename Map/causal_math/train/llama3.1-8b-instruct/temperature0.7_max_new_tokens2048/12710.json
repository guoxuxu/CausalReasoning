  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number representing an initial value in the complex plane. This scenario deals with the evolution of the complex function over time and explores the possible effects of external complex transformations.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{i \\theta t} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), altering the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies the trajectory, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a product of both \\\\( e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot z_0 \\\\) and the additional rotation by \\\\( e^{i \\theta (T - t_1)} \\\\). Thus, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
