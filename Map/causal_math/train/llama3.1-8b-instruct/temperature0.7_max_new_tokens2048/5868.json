  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We also consider a Laplace transformation, where \\\\(L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt\\\\) is applied.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\\\(L(z)(s)\\\\), can we specify which transformations were applied (initial or corrective) and details about their parameters, purely based on the final form of \\\\(L(z)(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformation paths might yield an identical Laplace transform due to the inherent properties of the Laplace transformation. The transform integrates over all time, blending effects of different interventions, which complicates disambiguating the sequence or exact nature of transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
