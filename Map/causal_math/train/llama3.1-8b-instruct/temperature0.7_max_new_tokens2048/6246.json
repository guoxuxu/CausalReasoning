  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) undergoing the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a rotation in the complex plane. The system's behavior is analyzed against the backdrop of an integral transform defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), with s as a complex parameter.\n\nAfter observing the integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at time T, can one unequivocally trace back and reconstruct the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) without any knowledge of whether the rotational transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the rotational transformation could have altered the original function in a complex and time-varying way, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) solely based on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without knowing if and how the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
