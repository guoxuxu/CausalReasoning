  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit with resistors, capacitors, and inductors described by the differential equation \\\\(V(t) = L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, I is the current, and V(t) is the input voltage at time t.\n\nIf the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is set to a sinusoidal function at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equation without further intervention, will the resulting current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at t = T also be sinusoidal if the circuit is purely resistive (L = 0 and C = infinity)?",
  "Explanation": "With no inductance and infinite capacitance, the circuit acts as purely resistive; therefore, the differential equation simplifies to \\\\(V(t) = RI\\\\). This implies that the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) will directly follow the voltage input and will also be sinusoidal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
