  "Problem": "In a control system environment, the system state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the linear system dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) where D is a linear operator. An impulse response given by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another linear operator, is considered over time intervals.\n\nGiven that the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is observed, can one determine the specific type or sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) used, based only on \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear nature of the transformations and the overlap in possible trajectories within the state space, different combinations of transformations \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\). This makes it challenging to pinpoint the exact interventions made based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
