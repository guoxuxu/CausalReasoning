  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} [u(x)] = M u(x) \\\\) where M is a linear operator. An operator transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Nx} u(x) \\\\) is introduced, with N being another linear operator. Analyze the influence of this transformation on the behavior of the function u(x) over the domain.\n\nGiven the observable \\\\( u(X) \\\\), can we precisely determine the specific transformations that were applied (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both) solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( u(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of transformations from \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\), along with their specific parameters (N and K), can lead to similar or identical outcomes at \\\\( u(X) \\\\). This makes it challenging to identify the specific interventions used based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
