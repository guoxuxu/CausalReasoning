  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( s(t) = L[f(t)] \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a signal over time. We're studying how the convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), represented as \\\\( h(t) = f(t) * g(t) \\\\), impacts the transformed system.\n\nAssuming an intervention by applying a different function \\\\( m(t) \\\\) such that the new function composition is \\\\( j(t) = h(t) * m(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final transformed signal \\\\( L[j(t)] \\\\) at a later time T be influenced by the initial convolution function \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( m(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention does not nullify the effects of the initial convolution with \\\\( g(t) \\\\); rather it adds another layer. The transformed signal \\\\( L[j(t)] \\\\) is the result of the convolution of the Laplace transforms of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and \\\\( m(t) \\\\), keeping the influence of each.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
