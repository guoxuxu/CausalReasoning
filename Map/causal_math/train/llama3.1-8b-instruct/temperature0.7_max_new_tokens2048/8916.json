  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RC (Resistor-Capacitor) circuit where the voltage across the capacitor is described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{R}I(t)\\\\), with R being the resistance, C the capacitance, and I(t) a time-varying input current. We analyze the behavior of this system under the function \\\\( g(V) = V + e^{At}\\\\), where A is a constant.\n\nCan we determine precisely the nature of interventions used (whether \\\\( g(V) \\\\), \\\\( h(V) \\\\), or both) just by knowing the voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of initial conditions and interventions. The impacts of \\\\( g(V) \\\\) and \\\\( h(V) \\\\) on the voltage could overlap or mask each other, making it impossible to identify what was specifically used without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
