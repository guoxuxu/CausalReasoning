  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -x + z \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = x - z \\\\). We scrutinize the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x, z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x(s) \\\\ z(s) \\\\end{bmatrix} ds \\\\) where A is a matrix given by \\\\( A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(x, z) \\\\) is applied to initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to the provided differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T align with the trajectory had \\\\( h \\\\) not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x, z) \\\\) alters the state by integrating the influence of the matrix exponential over time. Since the original system is a set of coupled differential equations, and A rotates dynamics in phase space, integrating this effect changes the trajectory path from the original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
