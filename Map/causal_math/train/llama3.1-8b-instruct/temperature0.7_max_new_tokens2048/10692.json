  "Problem": "Evaluate the relationship between a Fourier transform given by the equation \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i \\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) and its impact on the system's behavior described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + a\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + bu = f(t) \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf the final state of the system \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T \\\\) after various interventions is known, can one conclusively identify what transformations were applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) based solely on \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the precise transformations applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is not feasible solely based on end behavior due to complex interactions and dependencies within the system. These include changes in equation parameters and overlaps in potential influence from earlier transformations or interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
