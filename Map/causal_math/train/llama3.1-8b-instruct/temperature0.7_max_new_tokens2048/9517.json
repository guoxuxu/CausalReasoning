  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the input function. We explore the effects of applying a differentiation operator, defined by \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) = t^\\\\alpha \\\\frac{d^\\\\alpha}{dt^\\\\alpha} f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a fractional differentiation order.\n\nIf \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) for \\\\( f(t) \\\\) now yield the same result as transforming the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation changes the frequency components of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and because fractional differentiation affects both the amplitude and phase of frequency components, it changes the Laplace transform of the function. Therefore, applying \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) \\\\) results in an integral transform that differs from the one of the untouched function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
