  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in a complex domain that undergoes a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to it, resulting in \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{z(x)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Consider also actions of modifications using multiplier functions \\\\( m(x) = e^{-ax} \\\\) and \\\\( n(s) = s^b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\( m(x) \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) before applying Laplace transform at the initial time, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be affected solely by the parameter \\\\( a \\\\) in the transformation function, maintaining the essential form of the original transform?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( m(x) \\\\) which is \\\\( e^{-ax} \\\\) before the Laplace transform effectively shifts the transform in the s-domain by a constant \\\\( a \\\\), according to the shifting property of the Laplace Transform, thereby affecting \\\\( F(s) \\\\) by essentially shifting its poles without altering its fundamental form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
