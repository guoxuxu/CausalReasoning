  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -x + z \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = x - z \\\\). We scrutinize the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x, z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x(s) \\\\ z(s) \\\\end{bmatrix} ds \\\\) where A is a matrix given by \\\\( A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a vector field manipulation \\\\( i(x, z) = e^{t_1B} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x(t_1) \\\\ z(t_1) \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), where \\\\( B = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\), is applied as an intervention, does the new state at \\\\( T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the initial differential equations and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "In this context, the intervention introduces an additional variable through the matrix B affecting the dynamics along with the original system. This makes the resulting endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial system matrix and B, altering the future trajectory effectively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
