  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant. The system undergoes a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\). This changes the function domain and potentially the system dynamics.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 undergoes no change but evolves under the original system dynamics, will the Laplace transform of the outcome at a later time, \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\), be the same as directly applying the Laplace transform to the initial condition evolved with time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation defined by the Laplace transform is linear and interacts with the complex exponentials in a predictable way. Since \\\\( L(e^{At}z_0)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A}z_0 \\\\), directly applying the transform to the evolved function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) yields the same result due to linearity and properties of transforms of exponential functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
