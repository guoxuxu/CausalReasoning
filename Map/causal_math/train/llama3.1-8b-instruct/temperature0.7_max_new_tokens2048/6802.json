  "Problem": "Considering a complex function and its transformation by a linear operator, let \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) be a time-dependent complex function. The linear operator \\( L \\) acts on \\( z \\) such that \\( L(z) = \\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the resultant function at time \\( T \\), can we deduce the original function \\( z(0) \\) without knowing if the operator \\( L \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given that \\( L \\) alters the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) by convolution with the exponential term, without explicit knowledge of the operator's application, recovering the initial state \\( z(0) \\) uniquely from \\( z(T) \\) is not possible due to the irreversible integration process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
