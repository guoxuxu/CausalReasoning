  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by Laplace Transformations, where an initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}\\\\), and an intervention involves multiplication by the function \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\), where n is a positive integer.\n\nKnowing the transformed result \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \\\\) after an intervention, can we accurately identify the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used as the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific form of \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{n!}{(s-a)^{n+1}} \\\\), it distinctly points out the application of \\\\( h(t) = t^n \\\\) during the transformation. This result is typical for the Laplace Transform of \\\\( t^n e^{at} \\\\), thereby allowing for precise identification of the intervention function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
