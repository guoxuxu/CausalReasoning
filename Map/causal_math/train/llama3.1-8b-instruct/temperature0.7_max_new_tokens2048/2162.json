  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing physical quantities. We consider the effects of applying a Fourier transform as an intervention, modifying the function to \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency domain.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the original complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed domain \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing any prior details about \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "As the Fourier transform provides a one-to-one correspondence for L1-integrable functions suitable for transformation, and knowing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides all the required information to precisely calculate \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
