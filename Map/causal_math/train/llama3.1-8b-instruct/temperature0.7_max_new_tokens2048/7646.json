  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\( A \\) is a linear operator and \\( b \\) is a vector. We examine how the transformation and its inversion, where applicable, affect behavior over the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{cz} \\\\), with \\( c \\) being a constant complex number.\n\nIf the result of \\\\( L(f(z)) \\\\) is known, can the original complex number \\\\( z \\\\) be uniquely determined?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( L(f(z)) = A(e^{cz}) + b \\\\), the non-linearity and potential non-injectiveness of the exponential function combined with the addition of vector \\( b \\) and action of \\( A \\) generally prevent the unique determination of \\\\( z \\) from \\\\( L(f(z)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
