  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\), denoted \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\). We explore the implications of a convolution operation with another function \\\\( h(t) \\), whose transform is \\\\( H(s) \\), and its effect on the inverse transform \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time point during the convolution operation an additional transformation \\\\( L(s) \\\\) (another Laplace transform) is applied to \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\), and we then perform the inverse transform, will the resulting function only depend on the initial convolution \\\\( g(t) * h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L(s) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the product \\\\( G(s)H(s) \\\\) prior to the inverse transformation, thereby changing the resultant function. This makes the final output dependent on \\\\( L(s) \\\\) in addition to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), diverging from just the initial convolution result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
