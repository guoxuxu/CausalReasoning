  "Problem": "Imagine a physical system that can be modeled by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a region. Consider interventions performed using a boundary condition modification where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) on part of the boundary is altered using a function \\\\(h(t, x)\\\\), which is timedependent.\n\nGiven the system's state \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) at a later time t, can we uniquely determine the initial boundary condition \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\) used, assuming no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In the scenario where the Laplace equation governs the system and the initial condition determines the future state without further intervention, knowing \\\\(\\\\phi(t,x)\\\\) allows for the determination of \\\\(h(0, x)\\\\) as the solution unfolds uniquely from the prescribed boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
