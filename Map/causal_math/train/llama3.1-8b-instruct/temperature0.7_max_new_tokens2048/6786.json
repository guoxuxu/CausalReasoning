  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation represented by \\\\( h(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is another real constant, applied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), one cannot necessarily revert \\\\( z(T) \\\\) correctly to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the unknown scale factor introduced by \\\\( e^{aT} \\\\). The lack of information about whether and how the scaling was applied complicates tracing back to the accurate initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
