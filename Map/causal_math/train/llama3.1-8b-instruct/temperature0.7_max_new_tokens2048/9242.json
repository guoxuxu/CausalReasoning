  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant frequency and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex state. We explore the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\alpha s} ds \\\\cdot z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to precisely trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the integral transform can introduce changes that resemble natural evolutions under different initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
