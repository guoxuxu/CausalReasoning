  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. The change of this function over time is given by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, consequently changing the trajectory of the evolution. The transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can significantly alter how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), impacting the resultant state at time T.",
