  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output y(t) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial t} = Py(t) + Qu(t)\\\\), with P a differential operator and Q a control influence operator. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), on the system's behavior, particularly focusing on the impact of control function u(t).\n\nConsidering the output at T, can we determine which specific modifications (in terms of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) or \\\\(v(t)\\\\)) occurred at \\\\(t_1\\\\) based simply on the knowledge of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(y(T))\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end-point transformed output, it is challenging to backtrack and precisely identify the type or extent of interventions used. The effect of differential operators P and the dynamic interplay between u(t) and added v(t) lead to a scenario where multiple intervention combinations could yield similar transformed outputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
