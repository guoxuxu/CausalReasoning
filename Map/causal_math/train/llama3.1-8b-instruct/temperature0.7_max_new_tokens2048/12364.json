  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), with \\( B \\) also a constant matrix, is applied at time \\( t \\). We explore the effect of this transformation on the system's evolution.\n\nDoes the application of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) lead to \\( z(T) \\) being equivalent to the direct evolution of \\( z_0 \\) under \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\) for T > 0 without applying \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( f(z) \\) alters the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) to \\( e^{B0}z_0 = z_0 \\), but as \\( t \\) increases, the matrix exponential \\( e^{Bt} \\) modifies the evolution path of \\( z(t) \\) from its natural trajectory under \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), thus affecting the state at any time \\( T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
