  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the current I(t) depends on the applied voltage V(t) through the differential equation \\\\(L\\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI + \\\\frac{1}{C} \\\\int I dt = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance. Analyze different scenarios when mathematical transformations are applied to the voltage by a function \\\\(g(V) = e^{st}V\\\\) representing a scaling of the voltage by an exponential function over time t, where s is a constant.\n\nAssume at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another function \\\\(h(V) = V + e^{kt}\\\\) is applied as an intervention. Will the subsequent current I(T) depend solely on R, L, and C and not on s or k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\(h(V)\\\\), which introduces an additional changing voltage source, distinctly affects the system's behavior. The dynamical equation now integrates effects from both the initial exponential scaling and the later additive change, leading to a solution that conflicts and combines influence from both s and k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
