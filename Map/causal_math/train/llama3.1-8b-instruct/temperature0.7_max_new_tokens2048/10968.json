  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), transitioning through the system defined by \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\), where c is a complex constant. This scenario examines causal inference in system's transformations and their reversibility.\n\nKnowing only the end state at time T, can we ascertain whether an intervention occurred and what the new value of c was?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for multiple pathways and transformations leading to the same endpoint in complex dynamical systems (especially under quadratic transformations), it is infeasible to retroactively distinguish whether an intervention occurred or to determine the specific intervention values just from the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
