  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region undergoing a heat transfer process modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T + S(x,y,z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term depending on position and time. An intervention is introduced by applying a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(T) = T + \\\\gamma e^{-\\\\delta t} \\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\) are constants) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), or \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(T) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity to the heat distribution, superimposing another exponentially decaying term. The final state \\\\( T(T) \\\\) thus depends on the interplay between both transformations as well as the original heat equation parameters, resulting in an endpoint influenced by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), alongside \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
