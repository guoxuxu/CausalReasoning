  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nConsidering the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) observed, can we distinctly infer the sequence or specific transformations applied (Fourier transform, inverse Fourier transform, or both) merely from \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), distinguishing which transformations were applied is not feasible. The influence of L and the potential effects from compound transformations and their inverse make it impossible to perfectly identify the types or order of operations from the final observed state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x, T) → Fourier transform → F(u)(k); u(x, T) → inverse Fourier transform → u(x, t); u(x, T) → u(x, t)"
