  "Problem": "Consider a vector-valued function z(t) defined in a complex domain and governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\), where M is a 2x2 matrix. An integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Mt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied. The transformation is modified by a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to a vector \\( z_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\) without additional transformations, will \\( T(z)(t) \\) at t = T be equivalent to directly computing \\( T(z)(t) \\) from \\( z_0 \\) without applying \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\( f(z) \\) alters the initial vector by a phase factor which scales and rotates the vector in the complex plane. This modification affects how the vector evolves over time under \\( M \\) and subsequently changes the results of the integral transformation \\( T(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
