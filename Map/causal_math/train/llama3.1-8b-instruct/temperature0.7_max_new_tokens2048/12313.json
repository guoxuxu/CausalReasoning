  "Problem": "Consider the impact of varying the counterpart of a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) is a constant real number, on the integral transform \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\\\). We investigate how changes in \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) affect the outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the exact original value of \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) by analyzing the resultant \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\) without any prior knowledge of \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\)'s modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of modifications or interventions in \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\), such as the value of \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\), different scenarios could lead to almost similar transforms because the phase changes from \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) modifications might not significantly impact \\\\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\\\)'s amplitude or could overlap with other transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
