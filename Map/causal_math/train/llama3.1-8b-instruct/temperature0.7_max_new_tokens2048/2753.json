  "Problem": "Consider a feedback loop circuit implementing a Laplace Transform. Let \\\\( u(t) \\\\) be the input and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the output, subject to the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). The impact of an external signal modification by a complex function \\\\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\\\), where s is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to a signal \\\\( u(t) = \\\\delta(t) \\\\) (Dirac delta function) at t = 0, and then allowed to propagate through the system \\\\( H(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was directly propagated?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(u) \\\\) changes the input to \\\\( u(t) e^{st} \\\\) altering how the transfer function processes the signal. The Laplace transform of the modified input and application of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) yields a different output, impacting the overall response due to the change in frequency and exponential components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
