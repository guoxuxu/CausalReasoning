  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We examine how the function transforms under the operation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(s) ds \\\\), which is integrated over the time interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven a computed value for \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we reliably determine the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) specifically as \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) from 0 to T without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\( f(z) \\\\) could potentially correspond to different functions that satisfy the boundary conditions and are not limited to the form \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). Additional properties of the function prior to integration are necessary to uniquely identify the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
