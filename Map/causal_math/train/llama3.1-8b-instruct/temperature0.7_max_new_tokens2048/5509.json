  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal relationships in a complex plane system where the system response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) = H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + bs + c} \\\\). We examine the system's behavior under modifications through convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nDoes applying the convolution \\\\( h(t) * g(t) \\\\) and then observing the evolution of the system’s Laplace Transform significantly alter the characteristics of the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) translates to a multiplication in the Laplace domain, resulting in \\\\( H(s-a) \\\\). This forms a new system transform with shifted poles, thus fundamentally changing the system's frequency response and stability characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → b; b → c; c → H(s); H(s) → h(t); h(t) → g(t) → h(t)*g(t); h(t)*g(t) → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → system behavior; system behavior → characteristics of H(s); system behavior → characteristics of h(t)*g(t)"
