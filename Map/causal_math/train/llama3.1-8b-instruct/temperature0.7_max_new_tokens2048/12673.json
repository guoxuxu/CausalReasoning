  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Laplace transform on a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) with a constant matrix A on a complex function space. The transformed function is \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\). We will analyze the function after applying an inverse Laplace transform, possibly with an operational matrix M applied to it.\n\nGiven \\\\( g^{\\\\prime}(t) \\\\) obtained directly by inverse transforming \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\) back to time space, can we confirm that this originated from \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) without additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the properties of the Laplace transform and its uniqueness under proper conditions, the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(s) \\\\) back to \\\\( g^{\\\\prime}(t) \\\\) will confirm that it originated from \\\\( g(t) = e^{At} \\\\) as long as no further operational transformations were applied and initial conditions are identifiable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
