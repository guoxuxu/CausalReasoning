  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. We look at the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(s) ds \\\\), and see how it impacts the resulting function.\n\nAfter knowing the final state of the system post-intervention at \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can we precisely tell whether the intervention \\\\( g(w) \\\\) was applied and disentangle the effects of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the presence and effect of the intervention and distinguishing between the contributions of A and B solely from the final state is complex. The transformations could yield similar outputs for various configurations of A and B, making the recovery of specific intervention details uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
