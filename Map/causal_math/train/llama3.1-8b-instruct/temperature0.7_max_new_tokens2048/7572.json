  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations were applied (either \\\\( f(w) \\\\), \\\\( f'(w) \\\\), or both) given the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by merely knowing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The possibility of achieving the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) through different permutations and combinations of transformations (considering their complex exponential nature) makes it challenging to unambiguously deduce the interventions based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
