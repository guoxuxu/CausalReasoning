  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} z_0 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant and \\( z_0 \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\), represented by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nIf an additional Fourier operative, represented by a filtering process \\( h(s) \\), is applied to transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), will the resulting output be fundamentally dependent only on \\( \\omega \\) and not the initial condition \\( z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a filter \\( h(s) \\) adds another layer of transformation, making the filtered output dependent not just on \\( \\omega \\), but also significantly on \\( z_0 \\). The initial conditions and the specific nature of the filter would influence the resultant spectral composition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
