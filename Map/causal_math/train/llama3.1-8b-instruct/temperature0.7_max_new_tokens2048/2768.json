  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nBased on the knowledge of the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T\\\\), is it possible to establish definitively whether either transformation \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(S\\\\), or both were applied during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact history of interventions uniquely just by analyzing the state at \\\\(T\\\\) is not possible. The effects of transformations \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(S\\\\), especially when combined with the diffusion and interaction terms of the partial differential equation, can create multiple possible histories leading to the same observed endpoint \\\\(u(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
