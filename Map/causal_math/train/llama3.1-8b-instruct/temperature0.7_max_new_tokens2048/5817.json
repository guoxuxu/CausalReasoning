  "Problem": "Consider a transformation process where an initial function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is transformed by an integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[v](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2 + sx} v(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We analyze the causal inference between the input function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) and the transformed function \\\\( w(x) = T[v](x) \\\\) under various scenarios.\n\nIf \\\\( T[v](x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( v(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\), and then allowed to evolve according to its transformation properties without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\( w(x) \\\\) be a straightforward Gaussian integral transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) purely acts as an integral transformation, and the output \\\\( w(x) \\\\) is directly affected by the nature of \\\\( v(x) \\\\) without any external modification. Given that \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is also a Gaussian function, the resultant transformation retains Gaussian properties, simplifying to a standard form of Gaussian integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
