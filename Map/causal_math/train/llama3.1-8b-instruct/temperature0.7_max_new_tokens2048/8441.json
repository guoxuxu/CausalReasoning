  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) describes a rotation with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We explore the response of the system when \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is subjected to a transformation using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) such that \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) and then evolved with \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) for a time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still trace a circular path in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L \\\\) alters the initial condition based on linear transformation, shifting and/or scaling \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The trajectory will then evolve from this new starting point and will not generally trace the original circular path, especially if the translation component \\\\( b \\\\) is non-zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
