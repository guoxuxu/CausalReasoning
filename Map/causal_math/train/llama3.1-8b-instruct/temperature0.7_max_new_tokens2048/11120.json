  "Problem": "We consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions that describe oscillations in a physical system modeled by the second order differential equation \\( \\\\ddot{z} + \\omega^2 z = 0 \\). The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) is used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) at time \\( T \\), can we determine precisely whether the damping intervention was applied, based solely on this transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) captures the overall behavior of \\( z(t) \\) but might not distinctly reveal whether specific interventions, such as damping, were applied unless distinct signatures specific to those interventions are recognizable. Elements like overlapping effects from \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\omega \\), and potential similarities with solutions lacking interventions, obscure the precise identification of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
