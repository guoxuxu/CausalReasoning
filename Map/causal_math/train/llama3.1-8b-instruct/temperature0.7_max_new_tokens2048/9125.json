  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a linear operator in a complex function space. We investigate how the application of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the system's domain from time to frequency, altering its fundamental structure. Evolving \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z_0) \\\\) under \\\\( M \\\\) typically impacts the dynamics differently due to the transformation's effect on the function's frequency components, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
