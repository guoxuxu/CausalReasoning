  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that governs the temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is a constant. We consider the impact of an initial condition modification \\\\(u(x, 0) = h(x)\\\\) and the application of a transformation \\\\(u(x, t) = v(x, t) + w(x, t)\\\\), where \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) solves the original PDE and \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\) is another function introduced as an intervention.\n\nIf the initial conditions of the temperature distribution are set by \\\\(h(x)\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves according to its natural dynamics without further modification, will the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T be identical to the state that evolves from the standard initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The choice of initial conditions \\\\(h(x)\\\\) shapes the evolution of the system distinctly from any other initial conditions. Hence, the state at time T will specifically depend on the initial modification introduced by \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and differ from that evolved from standard conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
