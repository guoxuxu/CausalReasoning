  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nSeeing a Fourier transform result of \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - (\\omega + \\gamma)) \\\\), can we deterministically identify which frequencies (\\\\( \\omega \\\\) and/or \\\\( \\gamma \\\\)) were part of the modulation and the original function separately?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting delta function at \\\\( \\xi = \\omega + \\gamma \\\\) does not allow us to separate and unequivocally identify the individual contributions of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\gamma \\\\). The combination of these frequencies results in a single peak, and without additional information about one of the frequencies, we cannot attribute the contributions distinctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
