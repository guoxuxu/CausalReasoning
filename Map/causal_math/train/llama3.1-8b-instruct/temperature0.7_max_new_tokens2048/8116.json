  "Problem": "Consider a complex function integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an analytic function. We analyze how different transformations by \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) without and with interventions affect the transformed function.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform at time \\\\( T \\\\) as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\), can we determine accurately whether an intervention occurred changing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to some other function or if \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) existed through the entirety?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) does not carry information about possible intermediate transformations or the history of the function aside from what can be directly deduced from the current form. Without further temporal or pre-intervention data, the exact history remains undetermined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
