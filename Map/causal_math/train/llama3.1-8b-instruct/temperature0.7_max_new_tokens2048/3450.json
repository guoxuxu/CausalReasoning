  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the scenario where an integral transform \\\\( K(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(x, s)u(s, t) ds \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) being a kernel function.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) of the system, can we infer the exact initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without knowing whether the integral transform \\\\( K(u) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information on whether \\\\( K(u) \\\\) was implemented, it is difficult to reverse the effect of the integral transformation and uniquely determine \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\). The transformation could modify the initial condition in a non-invertible way, obscuring the original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
