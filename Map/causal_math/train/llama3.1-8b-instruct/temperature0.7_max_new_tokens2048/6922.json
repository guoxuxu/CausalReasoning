  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of an inductor and a resistor in series, subjected to an alternating current (AC) voltage source. The mathematical model is governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a sinusoidal source voltage. To investigate the response, we apply a Laplace transform on the system.\n\nCan we accurately revert to the initial condition \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at t = 0 by observing the transformed current \\\\(I(s)\\\\) integration results at a later time t = T, without information on potential alterations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of the current response in the s-domain incorporates the effects of both resistance and inductance on the altered source, making it non-trivial to reconstruct the original sinusoidal source function solely from \\\\(I(s)\\\\) without additional data on whether and how the voltage was altered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
