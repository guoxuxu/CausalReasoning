  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relationship in a system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + M\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = N z \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is applied which initially alters the state by converting space-domain information in z into frequency-domain.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a wavelet transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{W}(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(x,t_1) \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on how M and N affect the system irrespective of the Fourier and wavelet transforms?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{W}(z) \\\\) modifies \\\\( z \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), adding another layer of complexity. The end state \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\) is affected by changes induced not only by M and N but also significantly by the previous Fourier transform and the wavelet transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), which alter the route of evolution in the state space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
