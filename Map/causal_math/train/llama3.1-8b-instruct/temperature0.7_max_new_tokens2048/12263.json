  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the current state described by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) at \\\\( s' \\\\), can we infallibly deduce whether an intervention changed the differential equation's coefficient during the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z) \\\\) at any parameter \\\\( s' \\\\) may fit multiple scenarios where either no intervention occurred or the coefficient changed at one or multiple points. Overlaps in the transformation characteristics governed by different coefficients blur definitive causal inference without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
