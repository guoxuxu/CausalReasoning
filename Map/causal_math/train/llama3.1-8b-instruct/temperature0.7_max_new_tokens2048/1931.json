  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by a complex integral \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s} ds \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the square root of -1 and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the transformation under a subsequent function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is made by altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\\\omega \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 = T/2 \\\\), will the end function at time T still reflect the original formulation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) halfway through the integral affects the frequency component of the exponential, thereby altering the trajectory of the function from that point, affecting both the amplitude and phase of the resultant complex integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
