  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between two variables in a complex system where the effect of one component \\(\\ z \\) is defined by the integral transform \\(\\ Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), using the Laplace transform. We explore the scenario where \\(\\ z(t) \\) is a function influenced by another variable \\(\\ x(t) \\) such that \\(\\ z(t) = t \\cdot x(t) \\).\n\nGiven the transform \\(\\ Z(s) \\) at \\(\\ s \\), can we deduce the form of \\(\\ x(t) \\) without any assumptions or additional information about its initial condition or changes?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple functions can share the same Laplace transform due to properties such as linearity and initial conditions affecting the outcome, the specific form of \\(\\ x(t) \\) cannot be uniquely deduced from \\(\\ Z(s) \\) alone without more information, especially regarding initial values or functional changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
