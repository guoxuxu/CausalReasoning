  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant vector in complex space. This function is used to transform an initial vector in a complex vector space. We investigate the influence of applying an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) at a time t, where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) operates on a vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0 and progresses naturally under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) without further modifications, will the vector at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) had just evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In this scenario, since the transformation \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) is applied from the beginning and continuously influences the vector \\\\( x \\\\) in a predefined manner, the state at any time t = T will simply be a result of this uninterrupted transformation, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
