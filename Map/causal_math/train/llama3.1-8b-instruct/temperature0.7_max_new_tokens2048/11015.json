  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition. We look into the effects of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse affect the function over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation, \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\), is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be solely determined by the Laplace properties without considering the effects of transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory of the system, ensuring that the final observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not purely a result of the original Laplace transformation and its inverse. This additional transformation means \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on both the initial Laplace transformation and the subsequent square transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
