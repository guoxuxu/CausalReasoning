  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + au_x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) of \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can the original transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) be determined uniquely without knowing the system's dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the constant \\\\(a\\\\) and how it influences the system's dynamics via the term \\\\(e^{-iakT}\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely back-calculate to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) just by knowing \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\). The solution's evolution critically depends on these dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
