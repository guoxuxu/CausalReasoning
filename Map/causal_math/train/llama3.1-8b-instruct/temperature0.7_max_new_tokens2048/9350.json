  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nGiven the charge on the capacitor \\\\(q(t)\\\\) at a later time t, can we deduce the original amplitude \\\\(V_0\\\\) of the voltage source without other information?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) alone, without information about initial conditions or system damping, does not suffice to determine the amplitude \\\\(V_0\\\\) uniquely. The amplitude of \\\\(q(t)\\\\) also depends on the damping and initial conditions, which aren't specified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
