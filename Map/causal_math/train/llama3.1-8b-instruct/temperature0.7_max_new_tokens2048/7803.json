  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) representing the solution to a system of linear differential equations with a matrix A. An external operator modifies the trajectory through a time-dependent matrix transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) (C being a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) depend only on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not any other matrices?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(t) = e^{Ct} \\\\) as an intervention introduces another dynamic component that will interplay with the existing matrices A and B. The final state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) is a resultant of all these factors, making T dependent not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but also on \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
