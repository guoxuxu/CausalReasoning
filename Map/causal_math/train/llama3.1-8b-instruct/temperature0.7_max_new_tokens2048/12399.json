  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t governed by a set of linear differential equations in a matrix form \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) with M being a constant matrix. We evaluate how an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the state at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately infer which transformations (Laplace, Fourier, or both) were applied during the system evolution only by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely encode which transformations were employed due to the possibilities of overlapping effects and equivalencies in the transform domain outputs. The alteration done by each transform on different aspects (time inversion, frequency modulation) obscures the transform application history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
