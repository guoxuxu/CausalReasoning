  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod, denoted by \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To study the effects of external factors, an intervention is modeled by multiplying the initial temperature distribution by a function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is applied to an initial temperature profile \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\) be identical to evolving \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) directly under the heat equation to time \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the initial temperature profile, which affects the solution to the heat equation, leading to a different temperature distribution at time \\\\(T\\\\) compared to just evolving \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\). The function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\) specifically impacts how heat distributes across the rod, accelerating cooling in areas where \\\\(x\\\\) is larger.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
