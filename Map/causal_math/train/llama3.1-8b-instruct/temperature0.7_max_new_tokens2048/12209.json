  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Investigate the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 accurately without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the transformation brought by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) complicates the back-calculation, as the growth factors introduced by C are not determinable from A and B alone. The system’s reversibility is conditional on knowledge of all transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
