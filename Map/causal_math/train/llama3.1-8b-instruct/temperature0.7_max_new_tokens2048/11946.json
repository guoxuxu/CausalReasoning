  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its effect on the real part of complex numbers. We consider the transformation given by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf we introduce an intervention by a derivative operator \\\\( D \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( s_1 \\\\), applying \\\\( D(f)(z) = \\\\frac{df}{dz} \\\\) to the function and then apply the transformation \\\\( T \\\\), does the outcome depend only on the original function \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the derivative taken?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by the derivative operator changes the behavior of the function. The derivative of an exponential function is proportional to itself, but with potentially different constants, thus altering the integration result of \\\\( T \\\\). Therefore, the outcome not only depends on \\\\( f \\\\) but also on the intervention by \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
