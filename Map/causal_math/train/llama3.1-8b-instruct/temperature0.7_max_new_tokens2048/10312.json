  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, represented by \\\\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of \\\\( z(w) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nKnowing only the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) subsequent to an unspecified intervention on \\\\( z(w) \\\\) (e.g., multiplication by another exponential), can the original transformation characteristics (\\\\( A \\\\) vs. \\\\( B \\\\)) be definitively distinguished?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation resulting in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) obscures specific details about what transformations were applied directly to \\\\( z(w) \\\\). Without additional information or constraints, the resulting \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) does not reveal clear distinctions between the effects of \\\\( A \\\\) and the potential intervention via \\\\( B \\\\). This ambiguity highlights the complexity of causal inference in transformed domains.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
