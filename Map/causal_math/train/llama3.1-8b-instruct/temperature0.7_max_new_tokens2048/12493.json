  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA}x(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is an input function. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, on the input function over time.\n\nKnowing the system's output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at some t = T, can we infer the corresponding input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The modification introduced by \\\\( T(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\) affects the input in such a way that, without confirming its application, one cannot reverse-engineer the initial conditions accurately. The effect of matrix B on x(t) compounds over time, making it impossible to deduce \\\\( x(0) \\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
