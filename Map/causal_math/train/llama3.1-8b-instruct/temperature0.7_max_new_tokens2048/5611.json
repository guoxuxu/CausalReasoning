  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a set of linear algebraic equations driven by a matrix function \\\\( X(t) = e^{At}X_0 \\\\), where A is a diagonalizable matrix. We further examine the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( g(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At}X(t) dt \\\\) on the system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), another integral transformation based on a different matrix \\\\( B \\\\) (i.e., \\\\( h(X) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{-Bt}X(t) dt \\\\)) is applied, will the resultant matrix \\\\( X(T) \\\\) be determined solely by the matrix A and not be influenced by the initial transformation \\\\( g(X) \\\\) or the later intervention \\\\( h(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Each integral transformation adjusts the trajectory of the matrix evolution, incorporating the effects of both the initial and the intervening matrices (A and B). Consequently, the state of \\\\( X(T) \\\\) will rely on the cumulative influence of A, the initial transformation properties, and the intervening effects of B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
