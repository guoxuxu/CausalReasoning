  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being real constants.\n\nGiven the final system state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively determine whether the parameters were changed at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), just from the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a result of the complex interplay between initial conditions, the first set of parameters up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the altered parameters after \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The multiple influences and the non-linear dynamics preclude precise back-calculation to identify the nature and timing of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
