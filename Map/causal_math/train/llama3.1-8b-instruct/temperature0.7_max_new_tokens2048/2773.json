  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex number. This system is analyzed in terms of the impact of the Laplace transform on the evolution of this function over time.\n\nIf the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed using the Laplace transform and then allowed to evolve with the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the behavior at time t = T be the same as the untransformed system?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform changes the domain from time to the complex frequency domain, which fundamentally alters the characteristics of the system. Thus, the transformed system will not exhibit the same time-domain behavior as the untransformed system at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
