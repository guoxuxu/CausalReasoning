  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant real number, representing angular frequency. The function transforms using a Fourier Transform, represented by \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nIf the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is modified to \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the resulting Fourier Transform be centered at \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\), indifferent to the original \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the frequency to \\\\(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta\\\\omega\\\\) alters the function such that its Fourier Transform will correspondingly shift to the new frequency. This transformation is independent of the original value of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "modification of ω → change in z(t); ω → z(t); Δω → modification of ω; z(t) → F(ω); ω → F(ω); modification of z(t) → F(ω + Δω); ω + Δω → F(ω + Δω)"
