  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system described by a Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) defined as \\\\(f(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds\\\\). The scenario explores how manipulations to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) affect the outcome of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over an interval.\n\nCan the exact nature of an intervention (specific damping or polynomial adjustment) on \\\\( g(s) \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integral transformation's nature and the multiple potential modifications to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) that can produce similar effects in the output \\\\( f(t) \\\\), it's impractical to uniquely identify specific interventions based solely on the observation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at a given time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
