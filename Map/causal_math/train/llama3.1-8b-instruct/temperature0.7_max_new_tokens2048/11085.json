  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We examine the effects of applying Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as well as its inverse and interactions due to various potential modifications.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ g(z) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\) is calculated, and let the function evolve based on properties of Laplace Transformation, will the transformed function's behavior reflect the properties of the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\\\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) fundamentally changes the domain and character of the function from time-domain to complex frequency-domain. The behavior of the Laplace transform, \\\\( F(s) \\\\), primarily reflects the complex exponential growth traits affected by the transformation, and cannot directly portray all properties (such as periodic nature) of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
