  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be reconstructed uniquely from the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without additional data or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation integral \\\\( T \\\\) effectively erases phase information about \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and incorporates the whole history of the function over an interval into a single result. As such, critical information about the exact state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at specific times is lost, preventing unique reconstruction of the original function just from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
