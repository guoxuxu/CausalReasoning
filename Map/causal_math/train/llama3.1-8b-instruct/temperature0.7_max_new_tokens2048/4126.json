  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) are complex constants. We investigate how the transformation by the complex exponential function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) impacts the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the evolutionary path of the complex function, and without knowing its application, the deduced initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could be erroneous. The presence of \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) means any observation at \\\\( T \\\\) could correspond to multiple initial conditions, depending on if and how the transformation was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
