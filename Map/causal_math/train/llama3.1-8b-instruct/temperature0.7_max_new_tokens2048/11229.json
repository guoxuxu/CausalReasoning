  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) in relation to a linear transformation system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We will inspect the impact of applying transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t on the evolution of the function z(t).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwo} \\\\) at t=0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the initial state of the system by applying the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to the function z(t), which modifies how z evolves. Consequently, the evolution of the transformed initial condition under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) will likely differ from the original trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
