  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform applied on a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\\\). We explore the causal implications of manipulating the function after its transform, by applying a frequency filter function \\\\( F(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( G(s) = e^{-bs} \\\\) is applied at a later transformation stage, will the final inverse transform principally depend only on the initial function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and not on the filter parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state, after applying both filters \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), depends critically on the parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The resultant inverse transform will reflect a function that is a version of the original \\\\( h(t) \\\\) shifted by both parameters, not merely affected by \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
