  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nIf the input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is modified by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x) = g(x) \\\\) at x = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the given integral transformation, will \\\\( y(a) \\\\) for a given a > 0 be the same as if the original \\\\( u(x) \\\\) was used without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation will yield different results since \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) alters the input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) across the domain [0, a]. The specific properties of \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\) will interact differently with the squared term, leading to variations in the integral result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
