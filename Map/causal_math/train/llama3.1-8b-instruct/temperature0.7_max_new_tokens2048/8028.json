  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a particle's position in two-dimensional space over time. We analyze how the system behaves under the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nBased on the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can one uniquely determine if transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied, given only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) might result from various sequences or combinations of the transformations due to the complex nature of exponential multiplication in \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Without additional information about the exact interventions or total transformation sequence, determining precisely which transformations were applied is infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
