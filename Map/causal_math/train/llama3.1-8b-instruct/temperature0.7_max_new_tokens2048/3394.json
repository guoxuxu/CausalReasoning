  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), and its interaction with different operational kernels. Through this scenario, we explore a system modeled by the equation \\\\( L[g(t)](s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2 + b^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the output in the s-domain, \\\\( L[g(t)](s) = \\\\frac{1}{(s-a)^2 + b^2} \\\\), can we infer that the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was a simple exponential decay without any oscillatory component?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of both \\\\( (s-a) \\\\) and \\\\( b^2 \\\\) in the denominator suggests that the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) includes both exponential decay and oscillatory behavior, characteristic of a damped sinusoidal function, not merely an exponential decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
