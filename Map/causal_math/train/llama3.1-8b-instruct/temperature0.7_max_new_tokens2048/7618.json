  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a matrix defining system dynamics, B is a matrix defining input effects, x is the state vector, and u is the control input. We examine the system under the influence of a control transformation defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without explicit knowledge of K?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking the specific details of K, merely knowing A, B, and \\\\( x(T) \\\\) does not allow for the precise calculation of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), as the effect of K through the matrix BK in \\\\( dx/dt = (A+BK)x \\\\) cannot be ignored or separated based purely on the endpoint data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
