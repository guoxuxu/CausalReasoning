  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nBy observing the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations (either \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied throughout the motion, solely based on the position at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) values, leading to identical or indistinguishable positions due to the cosine and sine components in harmonic motion. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
