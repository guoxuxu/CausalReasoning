  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a vector differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The transformation \\\\( g(z) = K^{-1}e^{Lt}Kz \\\\), where K is a matrix diagonalizing D (i.e., \\\\(D = K L K^{-1}\\\\)), and L is a diagonal matrix, is applied to observe its behavior under system evolution.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and D, can we determine which intervention was used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) at any time before T?",
  "Explanation": "Just identifying \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing D are insufficient to accurately deduce the type or sequence of interventions used. The potential for different sequences or types of interventions to produce equivalent endpoints under varying dynamics of M and transient states introduced means that multiple valid explanations could exist.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
