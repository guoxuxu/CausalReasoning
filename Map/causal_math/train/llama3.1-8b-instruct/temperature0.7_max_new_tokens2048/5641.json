  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a controlled mechanical system whose state variable \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the influence of the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) as described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Lx + K u \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input represented by a function and \\\\( K \\\\) is a constant matrix dictating the influence of \\\\( u \\\\) on the state \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf the control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is modified to \\\\( v(t) = cu(t) \\\\) for some constant \\\\( c \\\\) at t = 0 and maintained throughout the evolution, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at T be proportional to the state that would have been reached with the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the differential equation is linear with respect to both the state \\\\( x \\\\) and the control input \\\\( u \\\\), scaling the input by a constant factor \\\\( c \\\\) simply scales the entire solution for the state by \\\\( c \\\\). Therefore, \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will be directly proportional to what it would have been under \\\\( u(t) \\\\), scaled by \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
