  "Problem": "Assume we have a system represented by the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) following the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. At time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant, is applied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a starting value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to time \\\\( T \\\\) under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition which is now \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and because \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) generally introduces an exponential growth or decay depending on the real part of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), the resulting trajectory \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ fundamentally from the trajectory had the transformation not been applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
