  "Problem": "Examine a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), affects the system's evaluation over time.\n\nKnowing the evolution \\\\(u(T)\\\\) function at time T, can we determine the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether the Laplace transform was used during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Laplace transform was applied, it's unclear if the system evolved under the original dynamics or under the transformed dynamics; this ambiguity affects our ability to accurately deduce \\\\(u_0\\\\) from \\\\(u(T)\\\\). Different operations in the s-domain (resulting from the Laplace transform) can significantly alter the initial conditions needed to arrive at a particular \\\\(u(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
