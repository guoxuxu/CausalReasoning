  "Problem": "Consider a feedback system controlled by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Lz(t) + K \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\), where L and K are constant matrices. We examine the influence of the operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( M(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a different constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on L and not on D or C?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention \\\\( M(z) \\\\) adds complexity, as it further alters the trajectory, introducing dependencies on matrices D and C as well. The outcome at T is thus influenced by all matrices involved (L, D, and C), due to both initial and intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
