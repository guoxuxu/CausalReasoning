  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers. The transformation is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We examine the differential effects of this transformation on the trajectories of points in the complex plane.\n\nIf we apply a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bz} \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant complex matrix, can we say the endpoint at \\\\( T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) depends only on the original dynamics and not on \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) impact the trajectory by altering growth rates and rotational dynamics, hence affecting the ultimate position and condition of the point at time \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
