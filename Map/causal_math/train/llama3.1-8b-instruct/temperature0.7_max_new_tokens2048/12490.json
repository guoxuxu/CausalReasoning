  "Problem": "Analyze a control system where the output x is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Lx + Nu \\\\), with L and N constant matrices and u a control function. We evaluate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}x dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix, on the system dynamics.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( X(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}x dt \\\\) (where Q is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time t_1, will the observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be dependent solely on L and not on M or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds another layer of transformation affecting the state. Both M and Q modify the trajectory of x in conjunction with L, leading to a final state at T that reflects the influence of all three matrices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
