  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of a signal processing system where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) passes through a system characterized by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable. Then, an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T[x](t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(u) e^{-atu} du \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( a \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nCan we decisively determine the specific sequence and type of applications (\\\\( H(s) \\\\), \\\\( T \\\\), and \\\\( G(s) \\\\)) by only analyzing the output signal at time \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific sequence and type of operations applied is typically not feasible solely from the output due to the overlapping effects of transformations and their potential to produce similar results from different initial conditions and process applications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
