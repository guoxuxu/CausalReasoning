  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be a result of multiple combinations of rotational interventions due to \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) and the inherent properties of complex number rotation. The impact of these rotations can overlap, thus making it impossible to uniquely identify from the endpoint alone which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
