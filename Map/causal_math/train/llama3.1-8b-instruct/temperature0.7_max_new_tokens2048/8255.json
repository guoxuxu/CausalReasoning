  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nIf an intervention modifies z(t) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), changing its frequency to \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\), will the Fourier Transform of the new function still show only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) introduced by the intervention will adjust the frequency spectrum, manifesting both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) in the Fourier Transform result, depending on when the modification occurs and how it alters the existing frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
