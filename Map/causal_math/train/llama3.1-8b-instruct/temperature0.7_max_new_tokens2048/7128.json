  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0 \\), commonly known as the wave equation, where \\( c \\) is the wave speed. The study focuses on the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2x^2} u(x,t) \\, dx \\), where \\( s \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we determine precisely what interventions (the application of \\( T \\), \\( S \\), both, or none) were used by only analyzing \\( T(u(x,T)) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences of applying the transformations \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) can yield the same integrated value \\( T(u(x,T)) \\). The non-intrusive and highly aggregative nature of the Gaussian integration in \\( T \\) and the possible spatial-temporal shifts from \\( S \\) can result in identical outcomes from different transformation histories, obscuring the detection of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
