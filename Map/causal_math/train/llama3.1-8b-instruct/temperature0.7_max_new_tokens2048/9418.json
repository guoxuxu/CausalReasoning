  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = V(t) \\\\), where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and V(t) is a time-varying voltage source. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transform on the system, focusing on how the transformed impedance \\\\( sL + R \\\\) affects the response.\n\nCan we determine the exact value of the original resistance R after observing the transformed current I(s) without knowing whether the resistance was changed to R'?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the change in resistance, the transformed current I(s) could reflect different impedance values, making it impossible to uniquely trace back to the original resistance R, especially since both R and R' would satisfy the equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{di}{dt} + Ri = V(t) \\\\) for different i(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
