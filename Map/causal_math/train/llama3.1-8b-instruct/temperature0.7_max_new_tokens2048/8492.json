  "Problem": "Assume that a function \\\\( h: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) is defined as \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We investigate the effects of this transformation on complex-valued functions and their corresponding Fourier Transforms.\n\nGiven the final Fourier Transform of a function after sequential applications of \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) and an intervention \\\\( e^{bz} \\\\), can we determine whether the original transformation was by \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) or by some other function, purely based on the transform result?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential applications and the inherent nature of exponential transformations in the complex domain lead to a convolution in the Fourier domain that combines the effects of both \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bz} \\\\). This results in a final transform that could arise from various initial conditions or transformations, making it impossible to definitively conclude the original form solely from the final Fourier Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
