  "Problem": "Let the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Consider an intervention where a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i \\theta t}z + c \\\\), with constants \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), is applied.\n\nAssuming no knowledge of the initial condition modification by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, purely by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = T?",
  "Explanation": "Without a clear indication of whether an intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, the shifted initial condition due to \\\\( c \\\\) and potential phase shift from \\\\( e^{i \\theta t} \\\\) complicate backward deduction of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Multiple different initial conditions could evolve into the same final state under different operational conditions of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
