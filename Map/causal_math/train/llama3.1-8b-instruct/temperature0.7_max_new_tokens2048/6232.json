  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where a signal x(t) is subjected to a linear transformation using an operator L. The transformed signal is represented as y(t) = L{x(t)}. Further, an integral transform T defined by T{y(t)} = ∫y(t)e^{-st} dt is applied to y(t).\n\nCan the original signal x(t) be uniquely determined from the outcome of T{z(t)} when knowing only that transformations L and M were applied at some stages before T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining x(t) solely from T{z(t)} without detailed information about the specific actions of L and M is challenging. The transformations could be non-invertible or not uniquely invertible, and different (L, M) pairs might yield the same outcome, obscuring the details of x(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
