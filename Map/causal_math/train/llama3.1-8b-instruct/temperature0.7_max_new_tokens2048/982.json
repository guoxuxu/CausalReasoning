  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function over the complex plane given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_C g(s) e^{zs} ds \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is a complex-analytical function. We examine the effects of modifying the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) by a factor \\\\( h(s) \\\\), thus making it \\\\( g'(s) = g(s)h(s) \\\\).\n\nIf we observe a change in \\\\( F(z) \\\\) for a fixed \\\\( z \\\\) and contour \\\\( C \\\\), can we conclude that \\\\( g(s) \\\\) was necessarily modified?",
  "Explanation": "Changes in \\\\( F(z) \\\\) may be influenced by factors other than modifications to \\\\( g(s) \\\\), such as changes in the contour \\\\( C \\\\), changes in the complex parameter \\\\( z \\\\), or external disturbances not considered in the initial setup. We cannot conclusively attribute it solely to changes in \\\\( g(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
