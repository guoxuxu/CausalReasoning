  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving via the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. The whole system undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to a transformed space where \\\\( sX(s) = AX(s) \\\\) and \\\\( sY(s) = BY(s) \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation function \\\\( h(x, y) = e^{Ct}(x + y) \\\\) is applied, where C is a constant matrix, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend uniquely on the actions of A and B regardless of C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\). As the function combines both x and y, the matrix C introduces a new dynamic to the system, and the final state at T is a result of the combined effects of A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
