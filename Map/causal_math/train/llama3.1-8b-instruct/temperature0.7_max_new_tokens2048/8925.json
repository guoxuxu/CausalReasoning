  "Problem": "Analyze the transformation of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + i \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real variable. The impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) on this function is examined over a variable s, which is a complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\), and then evolved under complex function manipulations without any further transformations, will the resulting function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = T be the same as if \\\\( z(x) \\\\) was directly transformed at s = T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform changes the form of the function from a time-domain representation to a frequency-domain representation, affecting how the function behaves under complex manipulations. The outcome at \\\\( s = T \\\\) would thus differ due to the transformed domain characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
