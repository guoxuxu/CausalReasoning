  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Exp(Dt)x \\\\) over time t, where D is another constant matrix, is considered.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention through function \\\\( k(x) = Exp(Ft)x \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied. Will the end state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined only by M and N, irrespective of D and F?",
  "Explanation": "Using \\\\( k(x) \\\\) as an intervention adds another layer of complexity, causing the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) to depend on D and F along with M and N. The interaction between these matrix exponentials affects the final state through cumulative effects on the state's trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
