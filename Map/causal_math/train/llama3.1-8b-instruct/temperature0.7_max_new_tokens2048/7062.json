  "Problem": "Consider a linear system described by the continuous Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a time-domain signal. We analyze the impact of a modulation defined by the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the frequency spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{f}'(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we deduce the original signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without knowing whether modulation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether and what type of modulation was applied, it's not possible to correctly deduce \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{f}'(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone, as the shift in frequency could misrepresent the original frequency components of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
