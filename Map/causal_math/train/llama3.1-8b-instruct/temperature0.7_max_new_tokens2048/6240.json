  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform defined by \\\\(F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix \\\\omega} u(x,t) \\\\, dx\\\\) on the solution.\n\nGiven the transformed endpoint \\\\(\\\\tilde{u}(\\\\omega, T)\\\\), can we definitely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\(F(u)\\\\), \\\\(M(v)\\\\), or both), only by analysing the frequency spectrum at \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interactions between the Fourier transform, the evolution under \\\\(L\\\\), and the matrix modification \\\\(A\\\\) can result in similar or even identical frequency spectrums for different types of interventions. This overlap makes it impossible to precisely identify the interventions based solely on the endpoint frequency spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
