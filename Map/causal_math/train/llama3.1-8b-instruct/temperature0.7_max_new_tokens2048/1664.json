  "Problem": "In a controlled environment, the complex function \\\\( z(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) is implemented in a system, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a time-parameterized linear function given by \\\\( w = at + bi \\\\), with constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). The system's output \\\\( z \\\\) is analyzed before and after the application of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^T z(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a fixed time.\n\nKnowing the output \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) after the system undergoing the parameter shift at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we precisely track back and ascertain the exact time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of intervention along with the old parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation summary \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) may obscure specific temporal details such as the exact intervention time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) due to the complex exponential integration over the entire period. Multiple scenarios could yield similar outputs, making it difficult to precisely determine the time and nature of parameter changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
