  "Problem": "We consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\) in the complex plane. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) with complex variable s is applied.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) = -1 \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied at T = \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\), only knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple trajectories and interventions could lead to the same endpoint, especially in complex dynamical systems where interventions like squaring can drastically alter paths that reconverge, knowing merely the endpoint \\\\( z(T) = -1 \\\\) is insufficient to ascertain whether a specific transformation like \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied at specific time T = \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
