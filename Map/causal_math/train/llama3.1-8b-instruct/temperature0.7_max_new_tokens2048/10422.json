  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace transformation defined by \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)\\\\,dt\\\\) on this system.\n\nCan we deduce the exact values of \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) after observing the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s)\\\\), without knowing the original function form?",
  "Explanation": "The parameters \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) dictate the form of the Laplace transform, specifically influencing the poles and magnitude. Given sufficient understanding of transform properties, these constants can be uniquely determined from the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
