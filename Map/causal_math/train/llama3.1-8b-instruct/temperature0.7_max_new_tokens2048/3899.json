  "Problem": "Consider the linear algebra system where vector transformation through matrices plays a key role. Let \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be the state of a system at any time t, evolving according to the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and \\\\(N(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent  force vector. Let there be an operation \\\\(h(z) = S t z\\\\), with S being a non-commutative constant matrix applied at a specified time.\n\nIf a new function \\\\(j(z) = Qz\\\\), where Q is another constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > \\\\(t_1\\\\) be influenced only by the original matrix M and not by S or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening operation \\\\(j(z)\\\\) introduces an additional transformation through matrix Q, altering the trajectory set by S and M initially. Therefore, the final state at time T depends on all three matrices (M, S, Q), making the system dynamics considerably more complex.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
