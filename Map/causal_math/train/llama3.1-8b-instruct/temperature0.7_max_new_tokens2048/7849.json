  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) in the complex plane where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\), described by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dz} = Pu(z) \\\\), with P being a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qz}u(z) \\\\), where Q is another constant complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dz} = Pu(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) be identical to if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( z = Z \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{du}{dz} = Pu(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial function state by applying \\\\( e^{Qz} \\\\) at \\\\( z = 0 \\\\), which changes the trajectory. The factor \\\\( e^{Qz} \\\\) can fundamentally alter how the function evolves under the differential equation, leading to a distinct result at \\\\( z = Z \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
