  "Problem": "Analyze the impact on the solution of an integral equation \\\\( x(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) is a control function. We investigate the effects of transformations defined by \\\\( h(x) = Cx \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, applied at different times.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to the solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) immediately at t=0 and then allowed to evolve under the given integral equation until time T without further intervention, will \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the original integral equation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the integral equation, leading to a different trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time. The transformation \\\\( Cx \\\\) alters the state at t=0, changing the responses generated by the integral equation dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
