  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) applied to a time-dependent differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t) \\\\). We investigate the effect of an external transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(t) = te^{kt} \\\\) where k is a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is set as \\\\( g(t) \\\\) in the differential equation at t = 0 and evolved according to the equation until t = T, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same compared to if the system evolves with \\\\( g(t) = 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(t) \\\\) transforms the driving function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), it changes the input to the differential equation, thus altering the system's response. Therefore, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) when driven by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) would not be the same as when driven by \\\\( g(t) = 0 \\\\), due to the specific influence of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) on the system dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
