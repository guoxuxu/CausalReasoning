  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{Lt}z_0 \\\\), where L is a linear operator and z_0 is an initial complex number. We explore the behavior involving an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Kt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where K is another linear operator.\n\nCan the exact sequence of operations (application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or both) and the operators used (L, K, M) be specifically determined just by the observed output of these processes on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in the effects of different operators through exponential functions and integration makes it challenging to deduce uniquely the sequence or nature of operations applied. Given the complexity and potential non-commutative properties of exponential operator actions, multiple operation sequences might yield the same endpoint, creating ambiguity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
