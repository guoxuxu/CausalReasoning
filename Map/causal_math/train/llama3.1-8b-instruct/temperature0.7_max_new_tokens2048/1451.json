  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t represents time. We investigate the influence of a Fourier transformation on this function, represented as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) over the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf a time-dependent phase shift \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\) is introduced to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transformation, will the spectrum \\\\( F(z) \\\\) show deviation from \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a time-dependent phase shift modifies the underlying function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(t + \\\\phi(t))} \\\\), potentially altering the frequency content by shifting energy to other frequencies based on the behavior of \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\). This deviation reflects the additional time-dependent dynamics introduced into the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
