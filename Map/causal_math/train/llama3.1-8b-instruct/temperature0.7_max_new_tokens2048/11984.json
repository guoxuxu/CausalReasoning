  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t)\\\\, dt\\\\), where C is a constant matrix and T is a specific time period.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at the initial conditions and allowed to evolve under the differential equations without further intervention, will the final form of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) still solely be governed by the matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the trajectory by integrating the influence of matrix \\\\(C\\\\) along with \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) over time. This integrated effect alters the final expression of \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making it a result of the combined influence of A, B, and the integral impact of C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
