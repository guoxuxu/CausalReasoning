  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) and parameters (s, k) were used, just by knowing the output \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modifications imposed by transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\), which include exponential functions with potentially different parameters, suggest that similar outputs can result from various combinations of parameters and transformations. This non-uniqueness undermines our ability to conclusively identify the interventions and their parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
