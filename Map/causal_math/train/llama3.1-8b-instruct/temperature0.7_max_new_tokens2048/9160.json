  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving over time under the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the effects of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) for a matrix C.\n\nCan we exactly determine what transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) were applied to reach the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), solely by examining the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations or sequences of the transformations due to the linear superposition and the modifying impacts of matrix exponentials in the complex function space. This makes it unfeasible to uniquely trace back the specific interventions, particularly when compounding transformations involve non-commuting matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
