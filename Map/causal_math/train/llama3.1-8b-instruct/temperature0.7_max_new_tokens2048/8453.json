  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Assume \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and x is a constant vector. Let the impact of an operational matrix B be scrutinized via the transformation \\\\( h(s) = B \\\\cdot g(s) \\\\) where B commutes with A.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( g(s) \\\\) via the Laplace transform and then operated on by the matrix B, resulting in \\\\( h(s) \\\\), will \\\\( h(s) \\\\) simply be the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{At}Bx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since B commutes with A, the operation of B on \\\\( g(s) \\\\) directly corresponds to the operation on the time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) yielding \\\\( e^{At}Bx \\\\). This means that the transformed domain representation (\\\\( h(s) \\\\)) is indeed the Laplace Transform of \\\\( e^{At}Bx \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
