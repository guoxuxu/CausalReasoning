  "Problem": "Let's consider a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore the system's response under the transformation \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x\\\\) for a constant k.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention \\\\(h(x) = e^{-kt}x\\\\) where k is the same constant as before, is applied to the system, will the endpoint \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the oscillator's natural dynamics and not by the transformations \\\\(g(x)\\\\) or \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(x) = e^{-kt}x\\\\) effectively attempts to reverse the initial transformation effect, yet due to the timing and potential discrepancy in exact alignment of t_1 with t, there could be residual effects. Therefore, the final state at \\\\(x(T)\\\\) still depends on both the original transformation and the intervention, altering the system's trajectory from its natural path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
