  "Problem": "Analyzing a scenario where Z is a complex function defined as \\\\(Z(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t) \\, dt\\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is a function that represents a system's response. We are interested in how changes in the real or imaginary part of \\\\(z\\\\) influence \\\\(Z(z)\\\\), and how interventions through transformational functions could affect the outputs.\n\nKnowing that the magnitude of \\\\(Z(z)\\\\) has decreased, can it be inferred that the real part of \\\\(z\\\\) was increased without any information about interventions?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in \\\\(Z(z)\\\\) can be caused either by increasing the real part of \\\\(z\\\\) or by other changes such as alterations in \\\\(h(t)\\\\) or the imaginary part of \\\\(z\\\\). Without explicit knowledge of these variables or any interventions, the cause of the decrease in magnitude cannot be solely attributed to an increase in the real part of \\\\(z\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
