  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z \\\\) on the complex plane defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real matrix. We investigate how the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also being a real matrix, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), i.e., knowledge of \\\\( B \\\\), the effect of the transformation by \\\\( f \\\\) at t = 0 or during the interval can significantly alter the trajectory, making it impossible to deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unambiguously from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
