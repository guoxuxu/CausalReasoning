  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nBased on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T, can we determine the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) used at t = 0 without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) potentially modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in a way that cannot be precisely traced back without explicit knowledge of its application. The influences of both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), and their interaction through the transformation, obfuscate the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
