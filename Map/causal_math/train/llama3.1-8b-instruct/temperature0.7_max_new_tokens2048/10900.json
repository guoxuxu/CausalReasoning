  "Problem": "Consider a complex mapping scenario given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, over the complex plane.\n\nGiven the final observed transformation result \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at some complex value, can we deduce whether \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\) was applied as an intervention based only on this result?",
  "Explanation": "Identical transformations could arise from applying \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\) or even multiple applications of either, as long as the combined effects result in the same total shift in the complex plane. The ambiguity in complex addition under the exponentiation function makes it impossible to uniquely determine which interventions were used without additional context or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
