  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a periodic input signal \\\\( x(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the signal frequency. The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) of the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = bx \\\\), where 'a' and 'b' are constants.\n\nBased on observing an increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we definitively say that the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in the steady-state amplitude could result from changes in the parameters 'a' or 'b' or environmental factors influencing the circuit's response. Without explicit knowledge of these variables or confirmation of their stability, one cannot conclusively link the effect to an increase in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "ω → a; ω → b; ω → y(t); a → dy/dt; a → y(t); b → y(t); y(t) → steady-state amplitude; steady-state amplitude → increase"
