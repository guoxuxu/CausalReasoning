  "Problem": "Consider the system given by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of the system under the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\), and its inverse Laplace Transform.\n\nKnowing the Laplace Transform of the endpoint function, can we precisely determine what transformations were applied (\\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) and/or \\\\( h(t) = e^t f(t) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations involving operations like multiplication by \\\\( t^n \\\\) or exponential functions result in modified s-domain functions that do not uniquely map back to their specific time domain transformations due to overlapping effects in the Laplace domain. Therefore, identifying specific transformations based solely on the resultant Laplace Transform is generally not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
