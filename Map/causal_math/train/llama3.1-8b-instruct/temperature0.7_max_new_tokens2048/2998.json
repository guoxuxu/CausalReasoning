  "Problem": "Investigate the scenario where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{Cx} \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is integrated into the dynamic determined by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\), D being another constant matrix. Analyze the evolution when the transformation \\\\( g(x) = z(x) * u(x) \\\\) is introduced.\n\nIs it possible to precisely infer the original vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at x = 0 from knowing \\\\( u(x) \\\\) at x = X, without awareness if the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was ever applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) enormously complicates back-calculating to \\\\( u_0 \\\\), as the transformation can distort the initial condition in such a way that it cannot be uniquely restored, especially if C and D do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
