  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem described by the Navier-Stokes equation in a two-dimensional domain. The velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) of the fluid is influenced by a forcing function \\\\( \\\\vec{F}(x,t) \\\\). We are exploring the effect of a transformation applied to the velocity field: \\\\( \\\\vec{u}'(x,t) = \\\\vec{u}(x,t) + \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential function.\n\nCan we deduce the original velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the transformation with \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) to the initial velocity field, it is impossible to trace back reliably to \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0(x) \\\\) due to the potential modifications imposed by \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), which influence the flow characteristics uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
