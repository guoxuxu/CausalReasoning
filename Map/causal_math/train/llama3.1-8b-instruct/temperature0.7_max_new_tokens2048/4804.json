  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) which is transformed via a complex function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. The function \\\\( f \\\\) maps inputs from a two-dimensional space into the complex plane, and \\\\( g \\\\) transforms these complex numbers over time t.\n\nGiven the output at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing an intervention occurred at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine with certainty whether the original transformation was \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ability to determine which transformation was applied originally is compromised by the intervention. Given the non-linear, sensitive dependence on initial conditions and parameter values, pinpointing whether \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( g' \\\\) (before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) was used originally cannot be definitively resolved from the output at \\\\( T \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
