  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is the input function to the system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different integral operator \\\\( S[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sB} f(s) ds \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the unmodified input function and not on either transformations A or B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation as an intervention introduces a new modifying factor, i.e., \\\\( e^{sB} \\\\). This makes the final state \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\) dependent not only on the input function but also crucially on both A and B matrices, which govern the nature of both transformations respectively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
