  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{ct}z_0\\\\) applied on initial complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. The system is further governed by another complex function \\\\(w(z) = e^{dz}w_0\\\\), where \\\\(d\\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\(w_0\\\\) is the initial state of another dependent complex variable.\n\nGiven \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\), can we deduce the initial complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing the parameter \\\\(c\\\\) or if the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation of \\\\(z_0\\\\) into \\\\(z(T) = e^{cT}z_0\\\\) modifies the base condition for \\\\(w(z)\\\\). Without knowing \\\\(c\\\\), the relationship between \\\\(z_0\\\\) and \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is obscured, preventing an accurate inference of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
