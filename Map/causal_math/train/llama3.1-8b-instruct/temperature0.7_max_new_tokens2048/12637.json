  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant. The function describes a point moving in a complex plane. We explore the relationship between linear transformations given by matrices and their effects on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nBy observing the wave pattern of \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) through time T, can we conclusively determine the transformation matrix A used at t=0?",
  "Explanation": "The observed pattern at \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) could be the result of different transformations that all yield visually or functionally similar wave patterns due to the complex exponential nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\\\), making it challenging to uniquely identify A without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
