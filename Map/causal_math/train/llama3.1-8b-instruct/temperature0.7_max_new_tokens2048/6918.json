  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined in the complex plane, which represents a rotation as a function of time. Analyze how the Laplace Transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) of this function, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}e^{it} \\\\, dt \\), affects the original function's behavior under various conditions.\n\nUsing the result of the Laplace Transform, can we unequivocally determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the uniqueness issues in the inverse Laplace Transform, especially without specifying additional conditions like region of convergence, one cannot unequivocally assert the specific original form of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely based on its Laplace Transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
