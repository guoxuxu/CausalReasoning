  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem described by the Navier-Stokes equation in a two-dimensional domain. The velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) of the fluid is influenced by a forcing function \\\\( \\\\vec{F}(x,t) \\\\). We are exploring the effect of a transformation applied to the velocity field: \\\\( \\\\vec{u}'(x,t) = \\\\vec{u}(x,t) + \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of an additional force \\\\( \\\\vec{G}(x,t) \\\\) affects the system, will the endpoint velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the initial transformation by \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\vec{G}(x,t) \\\\) introduces new dynamics to the velocity field, but the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) can persist or even interact with the new force, thereby influencing the final state of \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
