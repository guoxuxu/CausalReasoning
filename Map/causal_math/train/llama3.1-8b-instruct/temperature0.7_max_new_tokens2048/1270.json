  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined as the solution to the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz + k\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We are investigating scenarios where an integral transformation \\\\(w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied, with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\(w(T)\\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) if we are unaware of the presence of the matrix \\\\(A\\\\) in its transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integration involving \\\\(e^{sA}\\\\) obscures the direct relationship between the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) and the outcome \\\\(w(T)\\\\). Without knowing how \\\\(A\\\\) influences the trajectory through the transformation, it's impossible to uniquely infer \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(w(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
