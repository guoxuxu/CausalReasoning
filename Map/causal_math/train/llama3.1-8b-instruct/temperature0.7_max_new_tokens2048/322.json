  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented in matrix form as \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a invertible matrix. We explore the effects of applying a matrix transformation \\\\(T = e^{Mt}\\\\) to the vector \\\\(b\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(t\\\\) is a time variable.\n\nCan we ascertain the original vector \\\\(b\\\\) after solving the system for \\\\(x\\\\) when observing \\\\(Ax = e^{Mt}b\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\), without knowing \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the transformation \\\\(T\\\\) applied to \\\\(b\\\\), it is not possible to definitively trace back to the original vector \\\\(b\\\\) solely from the solution \\\\(x\\\\), as the transformation \\\\(e^{Mt}\\\\) could have modified \\\\(b\\\\) in any number of ways contingent on the nature of \\\\(M\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a matrix transformation T = e^{Mt} to vector b causes the system Ax = e^{Mt}b, and the original vector b can be ascertained by solving for x when observing Ax = e^{Mt}b at time t = T, assuming the transformation T is known."
