  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is a scalar potential field. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) introduced at a specific location in the domain.\n\nGiven the modified potential \\\\(\\\\phi'(x, y) = \\\\phi(x, y) + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) at some point in the domain, can we uniquely determine the original potential \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) without intervention information?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, provided the transformation is known (\\\\(\\\\sin(x+y)\\\\) is added), one can subtract \\\\(\\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) from the observed modified potential to retrieve the original potential field \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) governed by the Laplace equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
