  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a linear operator. We examine the role of a transformation initiated by \\(\\Gamma(z) = Qz\\), \\(Q\\) being another linear operator, applied at an initial time \\(t = 0\\).\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\(z(T)\\), can we decisively identify the interventions used (\\(\\Gamma(z)\\), \\(\\Xi(z)\\), or both) based solely on \\(z(T)\\) assuming all operators \\(M\\), \\(P\\), and \\(Q\\) are unknown?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\(z(T)\\) could be achieved through various paths due to different potential combinations and applications of \\(Q\\), \\(P\\), and system dynamics under \\(M\\). Without precise information on these operators and how they interact, it is impossible to uniquely ascertain the exact sequence or nature of interventions that led to \\(z(T)\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
