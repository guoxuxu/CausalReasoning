  "Problem": "Consider a linear operation in a vector space described by the integral transform \\\\( H(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(t) x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a transformation function. We study the effect of applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined by \\\\( D[x(t)] = \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nConsidering the output \\\\( H(x(t)) \\\\), can we determine if the differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before transforming, without previous knowledge about \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information about the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), the result \\\\( H(x(t)) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate whether a derivative was taken. Multiple distinct functions can yield similar transformed results, obscuring the effect of \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
