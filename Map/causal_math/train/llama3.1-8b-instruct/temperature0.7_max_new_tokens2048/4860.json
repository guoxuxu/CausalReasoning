  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by a partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Pz = 0 \\), where \\( P \\) is a differential operator. Consider applying an integral transform \\( H \\) as defined by \\( z(t) \\mapsto \\int e^{-st} z(t) dt \\) for complex \\( s \\).\n\nKnowing the transformed state \\( z(s) \\), can we unequivocally determine whether \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) or both governed the process, by just observing \\( z(s) \\) for all \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed result \\( z(s) \\) could potentially be produced by various sequences of applying \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\), due to the similarity in potential impacts these operators might have under the integral transform \\( H \\). Without additional information on the timing or nature of these interventions, it is impossible to pinpoint the exact operators used throughout.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
