  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz + Du\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, and D is the input matrix. We analyze the impact of applying a Laplace Transform to the system for an input function \\\\( u(t) = e^{Et}u_0 \\\\) where E is a constant matrix and \\\\( u_0 \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nIf an intervention modifies D to a new matrix \\\\( D' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_k \\\\), will the future state transformations of z(t) for t > \\\\( t_k \\\\) indicated by its Laplace Transform depend solely on the new matrix \\\\( D' \\\\) and ignore the effects of E and the initial matrix D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing D to \\\\( D' \\\\) modifies the system dynamics post \\\\( t_k \\\\), but the overall system's state as reflected in the Laplace Transform of z(t) will still depend on how the inputs were shaped by E up to time \\\\( t_k \\\\) and the historical influence of the initial matrix D. These prior dependencies and the initial conditions still play a critical role in determining the system's response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
