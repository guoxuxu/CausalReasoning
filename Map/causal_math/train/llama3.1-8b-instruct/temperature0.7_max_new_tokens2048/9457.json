  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is computed for a given \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\) without any additional intervention, does the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) solely determine how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves from \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using an exponential weight over a time interval, which alters the original state and aggregates it into a single output. However, it doesn't solely determine the evolution trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) outside the operation, which is still governed by its differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
