  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output \\( z \\) depends on the input \\( x \\) through a linear transformation and an integral transform with kernel \\( K(s, t) \\). Specifically, \\( z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( T \\) is a fixed time horizon.\n\nFrom observing \\( z(T) \\), can we infallibly reconstruct \\( x(s) \\) over \\( [0, T] \\) without additional information about \\( K(s, t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The process of determining \\( x(s) \\) from \\( z(T) \\) requires knowledge of the kernel \\( K(s, t) \\), as different kernels could yield the same output for different inputs. Inverse problems in integral transformations are not generally uniquely solvable without precise information on the kernel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
