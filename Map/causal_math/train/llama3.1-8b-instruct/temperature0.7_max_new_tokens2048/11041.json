  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analysis is conducted on the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), which transforms the function of time \\\\(u(t)\\\\) into a function of complex variable s.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is applied to function \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is an integral transformation that does not alter the fundamental solution to the differential equation but rather represents it in a different domain. Evolving \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) under \\\\(Lu\\\\) and transforming afterwards yields the same result due to the linearity and time-invariance of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
