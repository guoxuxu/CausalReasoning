  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform, where the transform of a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is given by \\\\(F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt\\\\). The analysis investigates the effect of manipulating the function before transforming it using a multiplier function \\\\(g(t) = e^{At}t^k\\\\) where A is a real constant and k is an integer.\n\nIf at a certain time instance the function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is modified by applying another function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-Bt}\\\\) where B is a constant, will the final transform outcome at s still depend solely on the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without considering the impact of both \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) as an intervention modifies the function further, resulting in a compounded effect from both \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\). Therefore, the final Laplace Transform's result depends on the transformations induced by both multiplier functions, not just the original function or any single intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
