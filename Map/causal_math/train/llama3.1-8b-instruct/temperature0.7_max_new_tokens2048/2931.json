  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where A and B are scalar constants determining the growth rate in two different components x and y, respectively, as functions of time t.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a linear transformation \\\\( L(x, y) = (x + ky, y + kx) \\\\) (where k is a known constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), and the system evolves to time T > t_1, will the form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) still be explicitly dependent only on the original growth rates A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( L(x, y) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of both components by mixing \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) which introduces additional complexity into the system, making the solution at T dependent not only on A and B but also on the intervention parameter k. Thus, the final form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot be computed merely based on A and B alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
