  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), where \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve over time governed by a system of coupled linear differential equations. The system is represented by \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the influence of the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\) on causal inference between \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) initially, and occurred transformation is allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\) without further intervention, will the behavior of \\( x(T) \\) and \\( y(T) \\) at a future time \\(T\\) perfectly match their paths had \\( z(t) \\) been evolved directly under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transformation alters the functional form of \\(z(t)\\) by integrating it over an exponential decay, which modifies \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) in a non-trivial manner affecting their evolution under the differential system. The time-domain behavior of \\(x(T)\\) and \\(y(T)\\) therefore diverges from the original path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
