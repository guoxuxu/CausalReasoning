  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant real number, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) the initial complex value. We are interested in studying the effect of applying the linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant real number.\n\nCan one infer the exact initial value \\\\(z_0\\\\) after observing the system at \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), recovering \\\\(z_0\\\\) purely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is ambiguous as both \\\\(e^{iAT}z_0\\\\) and \\\\(e^{(iA+B)T}z_0\\\\) are possible starting evolutions, differing by the unknown factor \\\\(e^{BT}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
