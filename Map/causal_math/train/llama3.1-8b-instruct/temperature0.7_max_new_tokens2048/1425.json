  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We are interested in how the application of a Fourier transform affects this function and the consequences of its application on the behavior of the system.\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and it is then allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) represent the original frequency content of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) directly reflects the frequency components of the function, capturing the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Thus, the transformed domain correctly represents the frequency content without any alteration to the original function's frequency characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
