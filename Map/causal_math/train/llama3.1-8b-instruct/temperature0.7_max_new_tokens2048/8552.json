  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic integral transform \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ax^2 + bx} f(t) dt \\\\), with constants \\\\( a, b \\\\) real and positive. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how the transform influences causal relationships by analyzing its effect on a specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how interventions might affect outcomes.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( G(x) \\\\) at some time, can we identify whether an intervention such as a scaling was applied directly to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional data about the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( G(x) \\\\) could result from multiple different forms and manipulations of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), especially in the absence of clear data about its form prior to intervention. The presence of quadratic terms in \\\\( x \\\\) complicates distinguishing whether scaling or another manipulation caused changes in \\\\( G(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
