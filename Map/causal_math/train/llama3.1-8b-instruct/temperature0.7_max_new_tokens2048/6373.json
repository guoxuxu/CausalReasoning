  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nIf the integral transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve through time, will the transformed function at a later time T still exhibit the same periodic properties as \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform alters the function by convolving it with \\\\( e^{-s^2} \\\\), which affects the frequency components of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The nature of the exponential decay in the kernel can significantly dampen or alter the frequency components, resulting in a transformation that does not preserve the periodic properties of the original function over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
