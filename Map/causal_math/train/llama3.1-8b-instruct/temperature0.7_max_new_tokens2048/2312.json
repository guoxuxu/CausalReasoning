  "Problem": "Assume a complex signal processing system that employs a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( F(s) \\\\), to convert time domain signals, \\\\( s(t) \\\\), into frequency domain representations. We analyze the causal effects of applying an inverse Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( L^{-1}(F) \\\\), and modifications to the signal post transform.\n\nGiven the final output after applying both Fourier transform and inverse Laplace transform with an unknown intermediate filtering action \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine the specific nature of the intervention \\\\( H(s) \\\\) solely from the final output?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the specific filter characteristics or even verifying its use from the final output alone is implausible due to the transformations’ complexity and the multitude of filters that could yield similar outputs. Detailed properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), such as its frequency response, are necessary to trace back and confirm the exact nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
