  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed without any modifications into \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), does this transformation preserve the periodicity of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation transforms the periodic function into a function of complex frequency s, capturing exponential decay rather than periodicity. The complex exponential's oscillations are averaged out over time, resulting in non-periodic behavior in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
