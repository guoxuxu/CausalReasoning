  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nIf a different modulation \\\\( k(t) = e^{bt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention after initial modulation and before the Fourier transform, will the outcome in the Fourier domain depend distinctly on both modulations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional modulation \\\\( k(t) \\\\) will further shift the frequency content from \\\\( z(\\\\omega - ia) \\\\) to \\\\( z(\\\\omega - i(a + b)) \\\\). Hence, the outcome distinctly reflects the composite effect of both modulations, revealing the dependency on each.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
