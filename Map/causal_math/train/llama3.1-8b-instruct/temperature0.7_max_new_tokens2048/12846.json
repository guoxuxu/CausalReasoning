  "Problem": "Assume we have a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a fixed matrix. Consider analyzing the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\) applied to the system's response function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), hoping to infer causal relations.\n\nIf an intervention through an additional control function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), influencing \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u(t) \\\\), will the endpoint transform \\\\( L(x(T)) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent from the intervention \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( u(t) \\\\) alters the dynamics from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards, thus affecting the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and its corresponding Laplace Transform. The modified trajectory due to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) means that \\\\( L(x(T)) \\\\) inevitably depends on the nature and effect of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
