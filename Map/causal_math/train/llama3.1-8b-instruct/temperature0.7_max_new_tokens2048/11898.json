  "Problem": "Consider a complex function in the form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\) where x is a constant complex vector and A is a constant real matrix. We assess the behavior of the function after applying a Laplace transform, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an external vector function \\\\( y = e^{-Bt}w \\\\) (where B is a constant matrix and w a constant vector) is added, will the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for s > 0 purely depend on A and ignore the effects of B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( y = e^{-Bt}w \\\\) introduces an additional term to z(t), which affects the overall Laplace transform. The resulting transform function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will depend both on A and B due to the additive nature of the functions in the time domain affecting the frequency domain representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
