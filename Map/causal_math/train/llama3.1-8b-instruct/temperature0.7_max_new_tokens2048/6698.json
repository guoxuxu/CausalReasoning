  "Problem": "Consider a system function defined by \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) representing an integral transformation of the exponential function. The focus is to analyze the derivative and anti-derivative relationships between transformations.\n\nGiven the derivative \\\\(z'(x)\\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\(z(x)\\\\) without an initial condition?",
  "Explanation": "While we know the derivative \\\\(z'(x) = e^{x}\\\\), to uniquely determine \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) or any anti-derivative of \\\\(e^{x}\\\\), an initial condition or limit of integration is required to solve the integration constants.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
