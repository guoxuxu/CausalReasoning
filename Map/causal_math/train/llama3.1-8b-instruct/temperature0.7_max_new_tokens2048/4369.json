  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. Assume that the system's behavior is influenced by a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), transforming it into \\\\( Z(s) = L[z(t)] = L[u(t)] + iL[v(t)] \\\\), with s being the complex frequency.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = rz \\\\) (where r is a real constant) without further intervention, will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at s = S be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = rz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform changes the formulation of the function from time-domain to frequency-domain. While the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = rz \\\\) dictates exponential growth, the transformation alters the frequency components represented in \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), making it different from merely evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the differential equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
