  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(x, t) = e^{tx}i\\\\), where \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex variable and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real parameter, evolving over time according to the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the differential equation to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = bz\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is another complex constant) after applying the initial transformation and starting the natural evolution, will \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T\\\\) be solely dependent on \\\\(b\\\\) irrespective of the original constant \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) is shaped by both the original evolution parameter \\\\(a\\\\) before the intervention and the new parameter \\\\(b\\\\) post-intervention. As a result, the trajectory and endpoint of \\\\(z(x, T)\\\\) are influenced by both complex constants, not just \\\\(b\\\\), as the transition depends on the accumulated effects from both phases of evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
