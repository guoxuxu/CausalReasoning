  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic functional integral equation system governed by \\\\(I(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2 + xt} dt\\\\). We examine the effects of applying the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I(x) e^{-ikx} dx\\\\).\n\nAfter observing the Fourier transform result \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\\\), can we exactly reconstruct the original function I(x) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under suitable conditions. Provided the observation of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(I)(k)\\\\) is complete and error-free, it is theoretically possible to perfectly reconstruct I(x) using the inverse Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
