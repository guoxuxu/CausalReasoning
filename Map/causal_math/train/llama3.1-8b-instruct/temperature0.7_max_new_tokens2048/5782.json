  "Problem": "Analyze the causal dynamics in a control system where the output \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = Kx(t) + Du(t) \\\\), with \\\\(x(t)\\\\) as the state vector evolving according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) as the control input. The matrices A, B, K, D are constant. Consider the effect of a transformation \\\\( v(t) = Ce^{Lt}u(t) \\\\) applied to the control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\), where C and L are also constant matrices.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original control input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 by analyzing the system output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the input was transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a result of the convolution of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) (or its transformed version) with the system’s dynamics represented by A, B, K, and D. Without specific knowledge of the transformation applied, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely recovered from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the potential alteration by \\\\( Ce^{Lt} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
