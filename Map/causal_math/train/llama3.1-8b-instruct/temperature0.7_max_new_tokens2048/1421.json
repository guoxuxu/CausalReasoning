  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), will the state of the system \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) initializes the system with \\\\( e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\) instead of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), altering its trajectory. As time progresses, the altered initial state compounded by the dynamics governed by M can lead to a different system state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
