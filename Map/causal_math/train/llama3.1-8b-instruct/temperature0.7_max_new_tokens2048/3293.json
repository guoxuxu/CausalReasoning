  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a set of linear differential equations with characteristics matrix \\\\(M\\\\). An input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is applied, modeled by the function \\\\(V(t) = e^{St}V_0\\\\), where \\\\(S\\\\) is a constant matrix. The response of the circuit, represented by the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\), is initially determined by the impulse response matrix \\\\(H\\\\).\n\nIf the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at time t = 0 is modified by \\\\(V_0\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the system's natural differential equations with matrix \\\\(M\\\\), will the output current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the response if \\\\(V_0\\\\) had not been modified?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the initial voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\) by the transformation \\\\(e^{St}\\\\) alters the initial input conditions, shaping a different trajectory for the response due to the specific influence of matrix \\\\(S\\\\) on the evolution of the applied voltage under system matrix \\\\(M\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
