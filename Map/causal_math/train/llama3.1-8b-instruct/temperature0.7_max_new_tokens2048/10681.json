  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ x(t) \\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its response to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) expressed by \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The system’s impulse response is \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} \\\\), relating the input and output through \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is specified without any modifications and the system is allowed to respond naturally, will the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) solely depend on the initial form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) in a linear system is entirely determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the system's impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), represented in the Laplace domain by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\). Any initial form of \\\\( U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) uniquely specifies the output without further modifications, following linear system theory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
