  "Problem": "Consider a continuous system described by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We analyze the effect of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform, applied to the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nCan we deduce the original boundary conditions directly from observing the potential function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at a later time, without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies the representation of the boundary conditions. Without knowing this modification was made, it’s challenging to accurately map back to the original boundary conditions just from the potential function. Various transformed conditions could lead to similar solutions within the domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Applying Fourier transform → Boundary conditions → Potential function u(x, y); Boundary conditions → Potential function u(x, y); Laplace's equation → Potential function u(x, y); Potential function u(x, y) → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → Potential function u(x, y); Potential function u(x, y) → Laplace's equation"
