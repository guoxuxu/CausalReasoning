  "Problem": "We consider a system operating under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical phenomenon (e.g., heat distribution over time), and we explore scenarios where transformations and interventions occur, such as multiplying by a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations or interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both), solely based on \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to possible transformational redundancies and the overlapping effects of different functions in the Laplace domain, it’s impossible to uniquely deduce the exact interventions used solely from the transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Different combinations could result in equivalent transforms, adding to the complexity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
