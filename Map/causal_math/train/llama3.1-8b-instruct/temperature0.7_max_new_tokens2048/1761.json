  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, under the application of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\). We analyze how interventions by multiplication of a complex exponential factor affect causal inference in this complex waveform scenario.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any intervention modify the outcome in the s-domain compared to directly transforming the initial function at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform to \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) directly computes to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(e^{iwt}) = \\\\frac{1}{s-iw} \\\\). The transformation is deterministic and linear, thus transforming the function at t=0 or at any later time without modification leads to the same result in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
