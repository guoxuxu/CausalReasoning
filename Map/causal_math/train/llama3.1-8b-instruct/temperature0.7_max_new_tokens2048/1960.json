  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time, representing the real and imaginary parts respectively. An integral transformation defined as \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number is applied.\n\nCan the presence of the intervention (\\\\( z'(t) = z(t) + ce^{Dt} \\\\)) at t = T/2 be precisely detected from final \\\\( w(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final value \\\\( w(T) \\\\) integrates all changes, but different initial conditions and interventions can lead to similar end states due to overlapping effects of the exponential functions and diverse integration paths. Thus, based only on \\\\( w(T) \\\\), detangling the exact sequence and nature of interventions is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
