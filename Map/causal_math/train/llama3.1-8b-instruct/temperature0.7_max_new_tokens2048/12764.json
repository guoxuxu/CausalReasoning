  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation \\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\) represented by matrix \\( M \\), and its impact on a complex function \\( z(t) \\) defined by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}v \\), where \\( v \\) is a constant vector in \\( \\mathbb{C}^n \\) and \\( \\omega \\) a real number. We explore how the application of Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) and its subsequent inverse alter the original function.\n\nIf \\( T \\) is applied to vector \\( v \\) at t = 0, transforming it to \\( Mv \\), and \\( z(t) \\) is computed without further intervention, will the resulting function at any t > 0 be the same when the transformation does not apply?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( T \\) alters the vector \\( v \\) to \\( Mv \\) resulting in a new function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}Mv \\). This is not equal to the original \\( e^{i \\omega t}v \\) unless \\( M \\) is a scalar matrix proportional to the identity, therefore influencing how the function evolves over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
