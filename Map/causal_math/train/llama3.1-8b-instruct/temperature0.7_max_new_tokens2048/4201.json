  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. Let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without applying \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by integrating past states, weighted exponentially, which introduces a dependency of the future states on this modified initial condition. The transformation and the differential growth dictated by A and B matrices will lead to a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
