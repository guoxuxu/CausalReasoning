  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We will explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with A being a real constant, influences the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z(t) + e^{Bt} \\\\) is used (B is another constant), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) additionally influences the trajectory of the function, making the final observed state at time T dependent not only on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) but also significantly on A and B. The impact of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) and the transformation up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) contributes to the compounded effect, making it dependent on multiple constants.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
