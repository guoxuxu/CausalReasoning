  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), will the transformed state at time t be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) without applying the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the resulting function by integrating the modified exponential terms. The outcome, \\\\( \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} e^{iA\\\\tau}z_0 d\\\\tau \\\\), is fundamentally different from the original exponential growth rule, as it includes the effects of both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
