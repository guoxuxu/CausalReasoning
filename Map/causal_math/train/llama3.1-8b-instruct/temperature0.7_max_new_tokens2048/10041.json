  "Problem": "Analyze the causal impact on a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), governed by a set of coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du\\\\), where A, B, C, D are matrices and u is a control function. We explore the system's behavior as influenced by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = x_0 + iy_0\\\\) at t=0 and then allowed to evolve according to the given differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T) = x(T) + iy(T)\\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to T under the differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies \\\\(z_0\\\\) initially, which fundamentally changes the trajectory of both x and y. The transformation \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) affects the phase of the complex function initially. Given non-commuting properties of the involved matrix operations with the phase transformation, the trajectory diverges from the untransformed system's path, resulting in different states at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
