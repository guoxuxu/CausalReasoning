  "Problem": "In the context of continuous-time Markov chains, consider the transition rate matrix Q for a two-state system where state 0 can transition to state 1 and vice versa. Let \\\\(\\\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\\\) be the state-transition matrix used to solve for the probabilities of state occurrences over time t.\n\nIf an intervention at time t = t1 modifies the transition rates in Q to a new transition rate matrix \\\\(Q'\\\\), will the state probabilities at t = T > t1 be solely determined by the new matrix \\\\(Q'\\\\) and not the initial matrix Q?",
  "Explanation": "The state probabilities at t = T will be influenced both by the original rate matrix Q up to t1 and by the new rate matrix \\\\(Q'\\\\) from t1 to T. The transition dynamics before t1 will affect the intermediate probabilities, which in turn influence how Q' acts subsequently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
