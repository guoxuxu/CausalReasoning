  "Problem": "Consider a physical system under the Poisson equation \\\\(-\\\\nabla^2 \\\\phi = \\\\rho\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is the potential field and \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) is the charge density. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform to both sides of the equation in the context of changing system conditions.\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of the potential field \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) at a certain time, can we precisely determine the original charge density \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) configuration at that time?",
  "Explanation": "Using the properties of the Fourier transform applied to the Poisson equation, the inverse Fourier transform can reconstruct \\\\(\\\\rho\\\\) from the transformed potential field. The direct mathematical relationship allows for precise back-calculation from effect to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
