  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number, representing angular frequency. We examine the impact of the Laplace transform on this function and how it influences the causal structure of the resulting transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) represent the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) equivalently in the frequency domain without any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), calculated as \\\\( \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt \\\\), results in \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), which accurately corresponds to the original function in the frequency domain, encapsulating all information about \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
