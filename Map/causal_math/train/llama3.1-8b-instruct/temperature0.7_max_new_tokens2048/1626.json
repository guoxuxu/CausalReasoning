  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), such that \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} \\\\) represents the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into the complex frequency domain. Let us analyze how the convolution operation with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) affects the transformed system.\n\nGiven the transformed result \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\), can we deduce exactly without ambiguity which functions \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) were convolved if we only have \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The product in the Fourier or Laplace domain does not uniquely determine the individual functions due to the convolution theorem. Multiple function pairs can exist that satisfy the condition \\\\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\\\), demonstrating the non-unique decomposition in inverse transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
