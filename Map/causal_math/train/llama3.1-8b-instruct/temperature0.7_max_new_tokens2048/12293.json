  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\\\overline{z}} \\\\), where A and B are complex constants and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the impact of a subsequent transformation \\\\( v(z) = C\\\\cdot u(z) \\\\), where C is a non-zero complex constant, applied over the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the specific values of A and B in \\\\( u(z) \\\\) solely by observing the function form of \\\\( v(z) \\\\) on the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "Given only \\\\( v(z) \\\\), which is a scaled version of \\\\( u(z) \\\\), it isn't possible to uniquely determine the individual constants A and B without additional information. The scaling by C affects the absolute values but does not provide separate insights into the values of A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
