  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system modeled by \\( Ax = b \\) for a vector \\( x \\) and matrix \\( A \\), involving transformations by a function \\( f(x) = Mx \\) where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We assess causal impacts in the presence of this transformation.\n\nIf at time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( g(x) = Nx \\) (where \\( N \\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) reflect the singular influence of \\( A \\) on the system?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(x) \\) introduces an additional influencing factor, resulting in the final state \\( x(T) \\) being dependent on the effects of \\( M \\), \\( N \\), and \\( A \\). These transformations can fundamentally alter the trajectory and the outcome, intertwining their influences in the resulting equation \\( A(NMx_0) = b \\), which changes the end condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
