  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) representing a Laplace transform of a function z(t) in the complex domain. We explore how modifying z(t) by applying a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), impacts the result of the integral where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is calculated, will \\\\( f(z)(s) \\\\) at some s be the same as if \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) was directly used in the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0(t) \\\\). The Laplace transform of the revised function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0(t) \\\\) results in a shift in the frequency domain, which alters the original Laplace transform of \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\). The outcome changes due to the frequency shift introduced, which is not merely a scale change but also involves a modulation in the domain of the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
