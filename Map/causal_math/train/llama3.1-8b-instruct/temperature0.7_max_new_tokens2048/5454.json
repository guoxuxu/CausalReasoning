  "Problem": "In the context of a quantum mechanics framework, the time evolution of a quantum state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, where the Hamiltonian operator \\\\( H \\\\) may involve time-dependent terms. We study the effect of applying an initial quantum gate transformation, represented by a unitary operator \\\\( U \\\\), on the state \\\\( \\\\psi(0) \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer if the initial transformation by \\\\( U \\\\) was applied to the original state \\\\( \\\\psi(0) \\\\), without any additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the application of \\\\( U \\\\) solely from the state at \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) is generally impossible without additional data on the evolution or knowledge about the characteristics of \\\\( U \\\\) and the Hamiltonian. This is due to the variety of possible states and transformations that could yield the same final state under the Schrödinger equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
