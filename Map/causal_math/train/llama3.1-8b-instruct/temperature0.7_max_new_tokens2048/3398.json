  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = 0 \\\\) in a bounded two-dimensional region with boundary conditions determined by \\\\( u(x, y) = g(x, y) \\\\) and the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x, y) u(x, y) dxdy \\\\).\n\nGiven the value of the integral transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\), can we infer the exact form of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) without knowing the boundary conditions \\\\( g(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The value of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) gives a weighted integral of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) based on \\\\( f(x, y) \\\\), but it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) or the boundary conditions; multiple different solutions of \\\\( u \\\\) could yield the same value of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) depending on the boundary conditions and the domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
