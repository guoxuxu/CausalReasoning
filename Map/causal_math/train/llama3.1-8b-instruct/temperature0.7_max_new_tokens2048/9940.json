  "Problem": "Consider a system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves in time according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then letting this transformed state evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), is it possible to conclusively infer which transformations (Fourier, inversion, or both) were applied at any time \\\\( t < T \\\\) solely from observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects and potential non-commutative nature of transformations like Fourier and inversion, multiple transformation sequences could result in the same endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Therefore, without additional context or constraints, it is not feasible to pinpoint precisely the transformations used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
