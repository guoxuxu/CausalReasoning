  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane where \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). We investigate the causal relationships under transformations by the function \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where k is a non-zero integer.\n\nIf \\\\( z(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at some point x = x_0 and allowed to evolve under its own natural properties without any further manipulation, will \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at x = T (where T > x_0) be affected by the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z(x) = (e^{ix})^k = e^{ikx} \\\\) modifies the rate of rotation in the complex plane. Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the behavior permanently unless reversed, thus affecting \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at any later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
