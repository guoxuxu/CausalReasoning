  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a certain domain with prescribed boundary conditions. Suppose an operator \\\\( T: u(x) \\\\mapsto u(x) + c \\\\cos(x) \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant, is applied externally.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at a boundary condition, then the solution to the Laplace equation is allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the solution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( t \\\\) be equivalent to the evolution of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) without the application of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the initial conditions by adding a \\\\( c \\\\cos(x) \\\\) term, which alters the harmonic function in the domain. This change in initial conditions results in a different solution trajectory in the domain influenced by the Laplace equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
