  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the evolution of a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time t is governed by the Laplace Transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt\\\\). Let's analyze how the system behavior changes with the introduction of a convolution transformation with another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\), defined by \\\\(w(t) = (z * h)(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) in the Laplace domain, can we precisely identify which intervention functions (convolutions with \\\\(h(t)\\\\) or \\\\(k(t)\\\\), or both) were applied, merely by analyzing the output state?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects and integration that convolution introduces in the time domain, multiple combinations of \\\\(h(t)\\\\) and \\\\(k(t)\\\\) could yield similar alterations in the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(T)\\\\). This non-unique factor makes it impractical to definitively determine the exact nature or combination of interventions based solely on the output Laplace state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
