  "Problem": "Imagine a continuous system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) as a transformation that acts on the state variable u.\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowledge of the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirming whether the Fourier transformation was applied, the phase and frequency modulation introduced by \\\\( F(u) \\\\) could render it infeasible to infer the exact form of \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), given the transform's impact on the signal's spectral components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
