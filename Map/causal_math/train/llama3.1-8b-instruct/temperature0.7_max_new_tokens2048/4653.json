  "Problem": "Consider a function modeled by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where z is a complex number. We evaluate the effects of an additional transformation defined as \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the analytic function w.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at initial time, and then \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied without further modifications, will \\\\( w(g(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as just applying \\\\( w(z_0) \\\\) without the transformation \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\) alters the argument of the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to \\\\( e^{z + a} \\\\), which is not generally equal to \\\\( e^{z} \\\\) due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex plane. This changes the output significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
