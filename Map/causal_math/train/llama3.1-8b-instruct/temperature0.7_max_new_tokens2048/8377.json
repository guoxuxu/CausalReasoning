  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a linear time-invariant system having an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is determined by the convolution of the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\), given by \\\\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). An operator \\\\( G \\\\) defined by \\\\( Gx(t) = x(t - \\tau) \\\\) acts as a delay of \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds on the input.\n\nIf we apply the operator \\\\( G \\\\) to the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and observe the system's output, does the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) only shift temporally following the delay introduced by \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G \\\\) results in the input signal being delayed by \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds, thus the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) will indeed be a temporal shift of the original output by \\\\( \\tau \\\\) seconds, expressed as \\\\( y(t) = (x(t - \\tau) * h)(t) = (x * h)(t - \\tau) \\\\). This preserves the original output characteristic, just shifted.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
