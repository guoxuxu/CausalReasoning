  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation equations \\\\(x(t) = Ax(0)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. The behavior of the system is examined when subjected to an external force through the transformation \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then evolved under \\\\(x(t) = Ax(0)\\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) had been directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(x(t) = Ax(0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(x) \\\\) initially changes the initial state which affects the entire trajectory of the system. Since \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) might not commute with A, the evolution path is altered, leading to a different state at time T than if the system was evolved without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
