  "Problem": "Consider the integral equation of the form \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)}f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix determining the system's dynamics and f(s) is a vector function. We examine the effect of the Laplace transform and its inverse on this system.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by a scalar factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), and the system evolves under the given integral equation, will the Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) differ from the scenario where \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is not modified?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( f(s) \\\\) at t = 0 by multiplying by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) alters the entire function subsequently affecting the integral equation's output. The Laplace transform, being a linear operator, will reflect these changes, resulting in a different \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) compared to the unaltered function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
