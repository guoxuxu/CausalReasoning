  "Problem": "In a control system, the output \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices controlling the system dynamics and input response, respectively, and \\\\(u\\\\) represents an external control input. Consider applying a Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( L(z(t)) = sZ(s) - z(0) \\\\), to analyze the system's behavior in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace-transformed system output \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) without control input, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\(Z(s) = (sI - D)^{-1}z(0)\\\\) from the scenario with \\\\(u = 0\\\\), and assuming \\\\((sI - D)\\\\) is invertible, we can multiply both sides by \\\\((sI - D)\\\\) to retrieve \\\\(z(0) = (sI - D)Z(s)\\\\), thus uniquely determining the initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
