  "Problem": "Consider the complex plane where functions are mapped using a transformation \\\\( z' = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) indicates time. Analyze the impact of this transformation under the integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), reflecting a periodic adjustment over time T.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without knowing the transformation was applied and T?",
  "Explanation": "The result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after its integral transformation doesn't uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unless additional information about the transformation parameters (like \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and T) is known. Without this information, multiple initial conditions could yield the same outcome due to the periodic nature of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
