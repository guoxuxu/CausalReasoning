  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) describing a dynamical system's behavior in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, modifying the function's phase.\n\nIf at some intermediate point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another transformation \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the values of A, B, C, D, and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) through their phase shifts can significantly impact the trajectory by altering initial and intermediate conditions. The end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) hence depends on all parameters, including \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), alongside the constants defining the system's differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
