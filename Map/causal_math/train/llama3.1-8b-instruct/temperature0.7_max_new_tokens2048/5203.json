  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real frequency parameter. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequential applications of \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\) modify the trajectory, resulting in \\\\( z(T) = e^{aT}e^{(b-a)(T-t_1)}e^{i\\\\omega T}z_0 \\\\). Both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) will affect the outcome along with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as each contributes to the overall exponential factor influencing \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
