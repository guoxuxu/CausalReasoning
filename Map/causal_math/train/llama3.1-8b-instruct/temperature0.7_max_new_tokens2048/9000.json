  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the Laplace transform domain, where a is a constant. This function corresponds to the solution \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) being a step function. We analyze the impact of multiplying by another function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), corresponding to \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, and where b is also a constant.\n\nAfter observing the final time-domain output resulting from the interventions of both \\\\( g(s) \\\\) and \\\\( q(s) \\\\) and their Laplace products with \\\\( z(s) \\\\), can we accurately identify the specific constants a, b, and c used in those functions?",
  "Explanation": "Because multiple sets of constants a, b, and c can lead to similar or identical time-domain results after convolution and inverse transformations, it's impossible to precisely pinpoint the original constants just from the final output. This ambiguity arises from the non-unique decomposition of convolution results in the time domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
