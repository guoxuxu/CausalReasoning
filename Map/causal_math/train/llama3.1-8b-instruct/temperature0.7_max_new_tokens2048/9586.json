  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex-differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Az\\\\) where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex function, \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant, and A is a constant matrix. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is a constant matrix, over different times t.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowledge of initial operations, can we identify if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the conclusion without additional data, it is not possible to definitely ascertain whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied. The transformations by A and the effect of the differential equation overshadow and intertwine with the effects possibly introduced by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), making it indeterminate from just the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
