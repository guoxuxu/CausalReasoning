  "Problem": "Consider a function on a complex plane governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The scenario examines how the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^{2} \\\\) affects the output when applied at different instances.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) operates on the result, will the final result \\\\( f(g(z_0)) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as operating \\\\( f(z) \\\\) first and then applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operations of the non-linear transformation and the exponential function are not commutative. \\\\( f(g(z)) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is not the same as \\\\( g(f(z)) = (e^z)^2 = e^{2z} \\\\). The sequence of application alters the resulting complex function values due to these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
