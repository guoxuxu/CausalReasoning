  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without any other intervention, will the resulting function after convolution preserve the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with a Gaussian kernel acts as a smoothing operation, significantly altering the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). This results in a fundamental change in the function's behavior, especially in terms of its local features and sharp changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
