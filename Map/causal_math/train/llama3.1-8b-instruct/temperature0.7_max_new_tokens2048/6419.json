  "Problem": "Consider the equation of a curve in the complex plane given by \\\\( z = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, describing an oscillator. We investigate the effects of a linear transformation described by matrix \\\\( M = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\\\\\ b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) which rotates and scales the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the linear transformation \\\\( N = \\\\begin{bmatrix} c & -d \\\\\\\\ d & c \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, does the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original oscillator dynamics without being influenced by the transformations \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( N \\\\) introduces additional modifications that interact with the existing system state altered by \\\\( M \\\\). Thus, the eventual state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is contingent on both transformations along with the inherent dynamics of the oscillator, affecting the trajectory and final form of the orbit in complex plane.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
