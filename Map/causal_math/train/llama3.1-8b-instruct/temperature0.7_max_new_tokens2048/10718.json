  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function operates in a space undergoing changes described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\\\), with A being a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) could influence the initial state, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) may significantly change depending on whether or not the transformation was applied. Without this information, retrieving the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) merely from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is unfeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
