  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nKnowing the Fourier transform \\\\( F(f)(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at an earlier time, without knowing the exact form of \\\\( f \\\\) or whether any operations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution according to \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\) introduces exponential growth factors that cannot be explicitly unwound solely with knowledge of the Fourier transform, as the transform mixes frequencies and amplitude changes over time in a non-reversible manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
