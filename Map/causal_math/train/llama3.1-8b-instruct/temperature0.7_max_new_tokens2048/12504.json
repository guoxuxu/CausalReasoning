  "Problem": "In this setting, we analyze the behavior of a function z(t) defined in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is a solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Bw \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is evolved under the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = Bw \\\\) from an initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\) is applied, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t be the same if \\\\( w(t) \\\\) was first subjected to the transformation at t = 0 and then evolved?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w(t) \\\\) at the start develops an additional factor that evolves differently due to the compound effect of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). Therefore, the phases and magnitudes at time T can differ based on when the transformation is applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → i; A → z(t); w0 → w(t); B → dw/dt; dw/dt → w(t); w(t) → z(t); B → w(t); w(t) → z(t)"
