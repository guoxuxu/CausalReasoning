  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nFrom observing the state \\\\( w(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The observation of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to conclusively determine if the transformation \\\\( e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\) was applied. The trajectory influenced by \\\\( k \\\\) can achieve similar outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\) from different initial conditions owing to the rotational symmetry and exponential growth characteristics of the complex plane dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
