  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). The system's evolution is examined under the impact of this transformation over time t.\n\nCan we deduce the untransformed initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether or not the transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) was applied initially, deducing the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is not possible as the transformation could modulate the amplitude and phase, obscuring the original state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
