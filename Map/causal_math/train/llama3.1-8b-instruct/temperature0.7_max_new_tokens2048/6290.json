  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, and the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is used to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nCan the original constants \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be uniquely determined from the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) directly translates to its Laplace transform with distinguishable parameters involving both \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), these constants can be uniquely identified from the transformed function, provided the transform exists and is correctly calculated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
